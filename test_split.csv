Therapy has made things worse.,"I started going to a therapist 6 months ago. Tonight, I'm considering going to the ER.I could rant about my problems, thought patterns, history, abuses, traumas, addiction, etc., all fucking night. I could do it and I would probably never run out of terrible things to say about myself. Why am I like this? I can't keep up the facade of ""ok"" or ""normal"" anymore. A friend (they all live in another country) messaged me on facebook a few months ago while I was blackout drunk. The next morning, I had 47 missed calls from him and I read through the messages I sent. I laid out pretty much a summary of how I feel and the Big Words: ""I wish I was dead."" Since then, he has offered to be a wall to bounce anything off of, no matter what. Countless posts in this subreddit are written by people who truly do not seem to have anyone in their lives to even talk to, let alone have a person to vent to. I feel very ashamed and guilt-ridden that I cannot appreciate and use the support I have.But here's the thing...I don't want it. I think that being sad, being angry...its all I have. Its my personality. Its my passion. Before I turned 12, I knew I wanted out of this place. I knew that it, and the people in it, weren't for me and I will NEVER understand or be one of them. I've learned to be quite the performer, many say I am charismatic and cheerful. After 29 years, something has got to give. I've told my therapist the gist of what I have typed here and they directed me to the emergency room. I'm not going to do it tonight. I probably won't for a couple years, just for the grandparents to pass on with their version of me in their minds. Its the least I can do, I had a charmed childhood and they were a part of it.Thanks to anyone reading this rant. Without the internet, the sheer ""normalness"" of the world would have pushed me over long ago.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates a high level of distress, mentions suicidal ideation ('I wish I was dead'), and a consideration of going to the ER, which suggests a crisis situation requiring immediate attention.",False,,,A3
Should I tell my family?,"So I kinda tried to kill myself. Well- I wrapped a noose around my bedpost because my fan was too close to my bed. So I sat in my bedside with the noose around my neck and slowly slid down. When it tightened I felt numb. I wanted to die but I had my doubts. My vision was blurry and the numbing spread further and it was more intense. I felt sick to my stomach and my doubts hit me. I got up weakly and slowly. (Keep in my mind my feat were touching the ground I was just sliding down allowing it to strangle me) So should I tell my family? I'm afraid to. I hate myself and for the most part, always have even when I was a little kid. I'm 13 now and my brothers just make fun of me for being vegetarian and wanting to go vegan. They make fun of my beliefs and my mental illnesses (depression and anxiety). They call me gay, veggie boy, retarded, etc. my dad just tells me to man-up but they know I've always been the sensitive one. So should I tell them that I hung myself? I mostly did it because of who I am but also because of them. Sorry for the long post and thank you if you read it all.

Im sorry I couldn't help you.,"I work in a night club and tonight a gentleman came in who looked very frantic and on edge. I chatted with him for a while and it became apparent that he's a massive overthinker and very logical. He started talking about how he has tried to kill himself and how he's going to try again when he gets home.
I understand, Ive been there so many times but it really hurt to see someone so determined and ready to die. He shared with me how he's going to do it and I tried to talk him out of it. Everything I said didn't make a difference though, he appreciated the time I took into talking with him but he was ready to leave. He said he just wanted the noises to stop. I told him to remember the good things in life and try to take something positive away in our chat but he gave a small salute goodbye to me and left. I'm sorry I couldn't help you tonight. I hope you come in next week and tonight wasnt the first and last time I hear from you. You deserve so much better and I wish I could make the noises stop so you can sleep easy.

If you don't have excellent social skills you're fucked,"I really wish I put more time into improving my social skills. Making more friends and being a fun person. I should've never caved in to the bullies or dogooders who called me insulting names and chased me out of groups for making social blunders and making someone uncomfortable  It doesn't matter that I have a degree, let alone an engineering degree nor does it matter that I have great experience and a decent gpa. It doesn't matter that I am dedicated enough to drive over 100 miles for interviews with companies and some times multiple interviews with the same company. It doesnt matter that i have several references who can speak the world about my skills and dedication. All that matters is how well I can entertain and talk to others. People in irrelevant fields or even without degrees walk into technical jobs all the time because they know so and so or they really sold people on this position.It's too late for me to improve my social skills. I'm 26. Most guys my age already have high paying professional jobs, been with dozens of girls, have tons of memories of vacations/road trips/exciting times with their friends and are engaged to or with long term girlfriends. 28 is the median age men get married. They all say it will be much harder to find a quality girl when you're older than when you're younger. I really want to find a nice girl and start a family. There's a huge stigma of older men ""reliving"" their youth and going after younger girls. I'm afraid that by the time I get a really good job and have the excellent social skills needed, it will be too late and everyone will have settled down. I decided that if I do not get a solid offer by the end of the year im going to shoot myself. It's easy and has a high succeeds rate.

And so I OD'd on some medication. It was fucking stupid. I vomited it back up. Since then my life has got better. Unexpectedly. You never ever know what the next day might bring. I learned to drive. I have a new job, new friends that really care about me, I have a new career prospect opening soon, I've taken up art and crafts which makes me happy, things like woodwork and cosplay.

I am done.,"I'm over it. I do not want to live anymore. I'm tired of trying to do my best and life seems to constantly deal me shit hands. I first became depressed when I was 13 (am 24 now). I went through most of secondary school with depression because various amounts of different people bullied me. Once I finished school at 16 I thought it would get better but when a new door opens in my life I feel like copious amounts of shit comes with it.
I'd always had a reason to be depressed or to cut myself, up until a year ago. Last summer was  hard for me. 2016 was a shit year for me, the best part of the year was when I went to a music festival. I'd taken a fair amount of drugs at this festival and once I got home to my family, the comedown was intense and made living at home real shit for a week, after that week it didn't get better. The festival blues are a real thing, mixed in with a comedown and already underlying depression was not a nice combo. My relationship with my parents deteriorated a lot and I was on the brink of becoming homeless.
I moved out of my parents house as it was become homeless or eventually commit suicide. I moved in with some friends and had such an incredible couple of months. Things went south with a housemate and there was a lot of tension and a lot of arguments. We had some other peeps move in and everything's great, I've never actually been in such a good home situation in my adult life before. I don't feel particularly depressed, sure a bit down but nothing to what I've experienced previously. I hate this world, I hate our species and I hate our existence. This whole world is driven by money and your life is gonna be fucking terrible without it. I'm done with working a shit job for bog standard money and getting shit on left, right and centre by bosses. I want my life to amount to something and I know it never will. I can't even find a man that's attracted to me and wants to be with me.
I'm finding it harder and harder everyday to come up with a reason to carry on my life. I don't want to upset my family. The thought of that breaks my heart but I'm physically and mentally tired of trying to fight the same battle after 11 years. My family don't deserve the death of their daughter and my friends don't deserve a death if a friend. I can't carry on this way.

I don't want to be a burden,"I went to the mental hospital this summer. Spent the better part of a month there, in fact. I finally told the truth to my psychiatrist and was sent there.  It wasn't a bad place really, but I'm pretty sure i just got lucky with a really good hospital. They experimented with medications there and there were a bunch of groups to go to. Hell, I think I even almost made a couple of friends. Almost.  I'm out now. I'm still very depressed and anxious... in fact, I'm more depressed I think then I've ever been. I can't enjoy things anymore. Not a day goes by where I don't feel sad and not an hour goes by without a thought of suicide. I don't know what to do. I guess the meds I'm on aren't working or something?  I just don't want to be a burden. The doctors and my family were so happy when I left the hospital and now I'm in a worse place than when I first went there. I want to kill myself... and I'm just lonely. I have no friends or meaningful relationships with other people. I have crippling social anxiety and have given up on talking to people.  I just want to give up now. If that experience couldn't help me, what can? I'm trying to be healthy. I really am. I go on walks everyday to get out, I brush my teeth and shower, I take my meds... but none of it is changing how I feel. I guess the best way to describe how I feel is I want to give up. On everything. I just want to curl up and die or do nothing. I sleep way too much... 12+ hours a day. Just so I can avoid being awake.  Now this is just turning into a stupid rant, fucking great. Great. I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to tell my parents if I feel like this... we talked a lot about ""communication"" at the hospital. But I can't. I just can't. I don't want to tell anyone, except anonymous strangers on the Internet who will forget me a few minutes after they read this post. Hilarious, huh?  I'm starting school soon and I'll miss it if I go back to the hospital. I'm scared if I tell anyone how I feel I'll get sent to a bad hospital where I'll be miserable. I just... don't know what to do. I am miserable everyday anyways.  I guess a person to chat with would be nice ? I'm really lonely and talk to myself too much. I am bad at following up on replying but I'll try. or does anyone have advice for the comments? What do I do??!?!? There is just too much. I'm 17 and way behind everyone else my age.

Is it worth ending it all?,"I just cant seem to let go of the past..I've had suicidal tendencies since I was 12 years old and while they came and went,nothing has really changed the way they affect me.I was 12 years old at the time and the factors which really affected me were bullying and poor academic performance in school.I was also bullied by my older brother,which didn't help that I was obese and insecure at the time.Over the years,I began to realize I have very high functioning depression.It seems like some days things are ok,and I can do on,and other feel like I was want to put pistol to my head and just end it all.I haven't seen a therapist about any of this,which is something I likely should do,but I digress.In my teen years,I went through some pretty traumatic events which caused me to be almost kidnapped and basically fearing for my life and living alone.This eventually led to my family being forced to flee our home country and move to another one.This event is honestly what made a  previously bad mental health situation for me far worse.When I arrived,I had never felt more alone in my life.I was quite literally living alone in a 1br apartment by myself and spent whole months in isolation besides being in community college.Coping with everything was just the hardest thing.I felt like everyday life and just existing was a burden I didnt want to deal with.Eventually,I managed to pull through,but thats not without attempting suicide twice.Once was by swallowing a whole bottle of sleeping pills,which I ended up throwing up.The second attempt is one which is not only sadly ironic,as it is unsuccessful.It was my 21st birthday and I was going to go for dinner with my brother and his gf.I didn't have a gf,nor any friends,so it was just them two.I was in my room getting ready,putting my shirt on,then my jeans.I reached for my belt and just out of no where the room just felt dark,not literally,but It felt cold all of a sudden.Just very cold,quiet and dark.My breath became very shallow as I looked over my closet which had a clothes rack on it.It just felt like I had to do it.In that moment,I just felt a world  of emptiness,fear and sadness come upon me in an instant and I the only way to deal with it was to hang myself.So I got my belt,put it around my neck and tied it as tight as i could.I got on my knees in the closet,tied the other end to the rack and proceeded to push myself forward and put all the weight on my neck.I did that for 2 minutes or so and began coughing and choking.I couldn't do it.I untied the belt,put it on my waist and haven't attempted since.I don't know wtf is wrong with me.That night I had a good dinner,but deep down inside I was just rotting.It's been three years since I attempted.I tried to take of myself.I went back to my home country,which I left five years ago and I felt crushed.I went back to my old house(which was sold and couldnt go in) where all these events happened and after speaking to new homeowner,i tried to go in just to see what it was like,to relive what was a relatively happy time in my life to what it is now and the guy said no.I was so crushed.Everything I had known,all my friends,my experiences,my home,my whole life was gone due to the fucked up circumstances that led to me leaving.I went back two months ago and came back to the US a month ago and it hurts me every single day.I have the chance to move back,but there's little opportunity there for me.I really don't know where to go from here.I've thought about just going for the third attempt.I'm afraid i'll be successful this time around.My plan is to hang myself again,but this time,tape my hands behind my back.I don't know if I can go in with this kind of pain anymore.Tl:Dr -Was forced to leave home country,spent months in isolation,attempted suicide twice and going for the third attempt.",A2,0.9,"The individual describes a history of suicidal tendencies, high-functioning depression, and traumatic experiences, alongside current feelings of isolation and unresolved mental health struggles.

i feel so empty right now,"both my gf and i have always suffered with mental health issues, and we've always been there for each other for the past year we've been together. recently however she decided to go to a therapeutic school for what could be either just a few months or even a year and as a result our communication has severely lessened. she said she was getting sick of her mental illnesses getting in the way of her life for so long and wants to do her best now to manage them so that when she is out she would be a lot more stable and healthy and that would make our relationship even better.i haven't talked to her in a week and it won't be awhile before i do as she has to work her way up to earn more privileges such as leaving the school or using the phone and such. and it's been really hard without her. i know how unhealthy it is to be so dependent on another, but yet it's so hard to change. and i know i should be happy that she is doing what she can to better her life for her and everyone around her, and i am happy for her, and i'm excited to see how she will be as time passes, but i can't help but feel so empty without her.she was my motivation for everything. i'd get up in the morning so i could say good morning and talk with her before she goes to school/work, now i wake up at 4 pm after being asleep for over 10 hours. etc etc i don't feel like writing more examples/i realize how petty this is. i'm mad that i'm like this but there's no energy to change it. i've been on the verge of crying for days now but i just don't want to cry, because i know once i start crying it won't stop. i've just felt and done nothing for so long of my life. to have her enter my life changed everything and now that she's gone for awhile i don't know what to do. it's been so long since i've been alone that i don't know what to do with myself. i don't have a purpose for myself. i don't really know what to ask of people here, i just needed somewhere to vent.edit: i've realized that i probably should've posted this in  as i didn't really mention suicide at all here. sorry about that. i do feel suicidal, but i don't think i'd do it because i know how horrible it would be for my gf to be away for awhile trying to get help and hear that i killed myself while she was gone. i'm sure she would even blame herself for it, and i wouldn't want that.",A1,0.85,"The individual expresses emotional distress and dependency on their partner, but there is no indication of immediate risk or crisis.

Pitfalls of speaking with a counsellor?,"I've been clinically depressed and suicidal for the past 6 years, and I've scheduled to speak with both a counselor at my university and a private psychiatrist. This is the first time I've tried to seek help but, I'm not going to lie, I'm terrified of speaking with someone about it. I know the experience will be for the better, especially if I can get some medication to help, but I know that I cannot tell the psychiatrist (and certainly not the university's counselor) about wanting to die or my previous attempt. My mom told me that if I were to say this to either of them, I would likely be taken out of school and put in a psychiatric hospital, which I'd like to avoid if possible. If I can figure out some way to get treatment, I know that I've got a strong future ahead of me, at least in terms of career prospects and intellect. Does anybody know of any potential pitfalls or topics to avoid when speaking with a counselor or a psychiatrist? Anything helps.

When you are the source of your problems,"Most often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them, like abuse, bullying, illnesses etc. But how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you? I do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often. Shame, embarrassment, regret and low-self worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity. I don't feel any sort of direct sadness, lonelines or grief, so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here. I often invalidate myself because of this. I feel like since every problem is caused by me, I'm not allowed to treat it like a problem. But I am still allowed to validate my feelings. This is a rational thought in my head, so I guess that's a good start, but I can't bring myself to feel it. I still feel ashamed, embarrassed, regretful and of low self-worth all the time.Does anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings?",A1,0.85,"The individual expresses persistent feelings of shame, embarrassment, and low self-worth but does not indicate immediate risk of harm or crisis.

I've been neglected and thrown out into the deep water and I can't swim so if I don't make it painless and quick I'll drown anyways because I can't swim,"That's been my life. In January this year randomly no warning police show up. They throw me and my Dad out of our house for no reason. They had a proposed court order that was written by my moms lawyer to throw us out and somehow the police think its an order and no warrant they bust through our door and throw us out. They let my fake family into my house. My fake mom uncle brother and cousin. They came in and smashed up my house. Totally destroyed it. (have PTSD to a point where I hallucinate parts of the events) I was hiding in my room scared and I was on the phone with my Dads lawyer he was telling me to call the police he said this was outrageously illegal. I had such a hard time dialing 911 I never did because I was scared. Then suddenly they start pounding on my bedroom door. My fake brother and fake cousin both come in attack me (received a severe concussion i don't know why they were so...vile and aggressive they won what more did they want...) and they turn my room upside down. They stole what little money I had they could find. I'm a jobless 18 year old so $70 is a lot to take from me. I couldn't get a job because I was battling my anxiety disorder and I got fired from my other job for having it. For some reason its Semptember no justice in that situation and what I just found out today is really depressing. I'm living with my sister. I want to move out because her husband doesn't want me there and he's assaulted me twice. He's punched me in my face once out of the blue we weren't even talking and also shoved me into my room to shut me in there and I never really knew why I did that. I can't move out though yes I skipped a lot I've been separated from my Dad and I've been asking if he's ever found a new place for us to live... He hasn't found anything. He just revealed to me because of thousands upon thousands of dollars that was stolen from our house that day. He's struggling to pay $500 a month rent where he is living currently. IDK Y I haven't received justice. I doubt what my Dad is doing to fix it. The NH DOJ said that we would and the court said what happened that day in January was never ordered to happen. I don't know what I am supposed to do I'm headed for the god damn street at the age of 18 because of corruption in my state. (My brother in law says by November 2018 I'm out of this place whether I have a place to go to or not.) I'm still a high school freshman because I was homeschooled and my family split up caused that all to crash and both my parents oppose public school so I was forced out of school. I wanted to do it... what was I supposed to do... I didn't know how to do anything without support from a parent. My Dads solution was to get a GED when I needed it. I have no opportunities and no coach. I have an anxiety disorder. I have a broken up hateful family. I don't know what to do. I do have dreams I want to be a dentist or a lawyer. They both take 8 years though and as I do either of those jobs I want to be a musician/film maker and hopefully I can make those two my life. All of it has a theme behind it. My passion is to help people really. Music is a powerful healer and film is a great distraction to pain of any kind. If I become a Lawyer I want to help people bullied by criminals and corruption. As a dentist thats like physically healing people and dentistry is still something I'm really scared of. So I want to be one because I feel like I can heal people of that sort of pain. I guess its important to remember my dreams. Its just so hard to see any of those a reality. I don't know how to start at all. I can't go to college... I've been beaten to the ground and I've been so neglected. idk what I'm supposed to do. I have no parents to help me. I'm actually headed to the streets. I'm a fucking high school freshman...I just wrote a suicidal note. I plan on doing it before October 29th.. if not that than Christmas. Idk if you can blame me for it but I fucking hate Christmas. I really... I hate Christmas. No family to spend it with and no reason to be happy. idk if its selfish to say but the more happy people around me are the worse I feel about being the way that I am. Honestly, I just see no way out. What am I as an 18-year-old kid in his first year of high school supposed to do about facing homelessness? With an unsupportive parent and one who can't support me. I just have no teacher and no place to call home and work my way up with something to stand on.

im done..,"I'm 17 and currently in college, this post will most likely look like a mess as I am not the best with this sort of stuff but oh well. I struggled through school with things such as concentrating,thinking,writing/getting thoughts out and I guess I have social anxiety but never been told that by a professional (only by a close friend) and I have been feeling like shit for at least 2 years now and it is getting to the point of where I don't know what to do now.When was in school (Primary/secondary) they had never contacted my parents about that nor did they actually properly help me but they did put me in all the lowest classes and I would get more help near exams and go into different rooms.. But they never asked for me to be tested for anything like learning difficulties or such so I've just had to deal with feeling stupid and it feels like my fault but oh well I guess.

I'm honestly so lost.,"So i don't know what i should do anymore, I've attempted suicide before multiple times. Reaching out to my mom was the first thing i did after my first attempt failed, this was in middle school I called her told her what I did and she picked me up and i spent the night with her. I was living with my dad at the time since my parents were split. I'm not really sure what happen'd to cause me to become so suicidal and i might've forgotten at this point honestly but, its turned my life into a downward spiral. Once i entered middle school i completely started skipping class, i would sleep through them or skip. This continued until once again at the end of my middle school life i attempted suicide. This was the first time i had to be hospitalized for it and once again i asked for help and ended up at a therapist. Talking to him I lied constantly lied, lied, and lied. This was well how i was raised by my mom. I don't know if she was embarrassed of me or what but, when she got remarried she had me constantly lie to the guy. This started up even more once i started high school.I have 2 siblings one older and one younger sister. Their treatment is 200x better than me, throughout my freshman year of high school I always slept on the floor in our house we had a spare room but my mom made me sleep on the floor still i really don't know why. My older sister would let me sleep in her bed sometimes but not always. In my second year i got a laptop this is when i started playing games to keep my mind of suicide i honestly couldn't take my life at this point. I would constantly read books from the library during class resulting in extremely poor grades but, i didn't care to me I always felt worthless anyways only my 2 sisters were meant to be anything i was always going to be trash. My mom would make sure to always compare me to my older sister i hated it so much but, always i would bottle it up never say anything. My second year of high school i dropped out. Since then I've done everything i could to just find something interesting to keep myself happy even the smallest thing. Whenever my mom tells me something I'd just bottle it up and turn away. I've only ever gotten angry and yelled twice once in elementary and another last week when i just couldn't take it anymore.My mother constantly has me lying to friends and family telling them im in college or doing well i can't take this anymore i don't even know if i can try to pick up my life at this point. I honestly am just thinking of grabbing the gun in our house and ending it all.

Dont know how much longer I can take this...,"Hello! Im going to apologize in advance for any errors in what i'm about to type.I am 15 years old, in Highschool. Ive been depressed for over a year now, and nothing has helped me long term. The only person who cares about me wont even speak to me anymore. She would always be there for me whenever she noticed I was sad, and I basically humiliated myself when I told her that I loved her.She told me that im not her type, and I respected that and I moved on, we continued to be friends, but she started to purposefully make me feel a certain way when she didnt want to deal with me. She would usually just either do something that would make me feel guilty, or just avoid me and say that its for the better. But she would always apologize right after she did it, and tell me that she was sorry for doing this to me. She told me that she didnt mean to do this to me, and that shell feel at fault if I ever kill myself. I told her that I forgive her, and that all she has to do is be normal around me and she wont have to worry about hurting me. Months of me slowly losing everything I know and love passed, we both went to highschool, and over the summer I adopted the habit of cutting myself. It was the only way I could cope without anyone to talk to. My mother found out after 1 whole month of me cutting. She didnt offer any support, she just told me to stop because it would ruin her image. I didnt stop. After 1 week I messaged my friend about what im going through. She sent me an email in the first week of school telling me that she doesnt want to help me anymore, and that I need therapy. Ever since then, she wont even aknowledge that I exist. I have tried to ask her if we could talk things through, no reply. I sit at her table with the rest of my friends every day, everyone just acts like I dont exist. I have literally cried before and not one person asked if I was okay. Sometimes, one of my ""friends"" will make a ""joke"" along the lines of ""Why are white people so bipolar""- then he says some other crap that I will not repeat. (Yes, I am white, and besides 2 other people at my table, everyone is asian.) Its obvious that they are talking about me. They make fun of me a lot, its screwed up though because I have known them for all of middle school and some of highschool. Yet they act like im just some piece of trash.Though I said my friend acts like I dont exist, she will say hi to me everyone now and then, or sometimes she will ask how I am doing in school, all adding to my confusion. She is honestly the only reason I want to live, yet she is slowly just trying to forget me. But she is not judgemental of me, like everyone else is. That is why I still hold on to her. Well enough of my life story. Im honestly just planning on killing myself soon, its all just become too much to handle... I have attempted suicide before, but I ended up thinking of my friend and stopping because I wouldnt want to hurt the person who means so much to me. I told myself that if she doesnt respond to me in a week, then that means she doesnt care about me. Then, I will have nothing holding me back. I have already written everyone a suicide note, and its all readly available to be sent with a click of a button. Im just ready to die.  I know I sound pretty pathetic, but tell me what I havent already heard before by every single person I used to be close to.Well, goodbye everyone!

I'm so close at this point,"I've been in pretty bad shape since high school, but the last three years (overwhelmingly since 2017 began) have been the worst. My will to continue to go on is stretched so thin. I have recently realized that I'm a ridiculous hypochondriac. Ironic, for someone who is suicidal, right? I'm truly not afraid of dying at all, but I am afraid of long term suffering or having to deal with surgical disfiguration or complications or something, I guess, even though the suffering wouldn't be long as it'd just prompt me to do it already. But these consistent thoughts that I'm always sick or have something wrong with me, to an extent which is true as I've had some minor to moderate health issue over and over since this year began, have basically left me a shell of who I used to be (as if that was anything in the first place). It has made me think it'd be so much better and easier if I just skipped ahead of all the worries and finished all those thoughts already, much faster and more easily. And then there's how life is actually going. I'm in college, which I've been miserable at since I got here. I'm 21 and the last three years have been truly some of the most miserable years of my life. Since going to college, I've lost all my friends from before college, whether just by losing touch or by going separate ways in terms of personality development, so they're all gone .I've made ""friends"" but not a single friend who could give the smallest ounce of a damn (aka the reason I'm sitting in my apartment on a Friday night instead of being out, like everyone I know is). Any time I have had any plans, with anyone, they've bailed, in one way or another. I have a couple of people who bring me a lot of joy, but I don't bring any joy to any single person on this earth, and that's a really big pain for me. I've never dated anyone. I haven't been able to really deeply care about anyone because I'm so dead and cold inside that there is no point.
All I do is go to work and class, eat (which I can't even enjoy as much anymore as I've had so many god damn gastrointestinal problems recently I can't even be comforted by it anymore), and go to bed.
I can't afford psychiatric help, so I am and always have been on my own. The very few people I've ever had a somewhat real conversation with have dismissed me as being melodramatic and depressing (always a great thing to hear!), and I haven't even bothered to be really open with them. I'm an American, but a lot of family lives abroad and I have to work very hard to send money back there because they need it, which at this point is the only thing that gives me some sense of fulfillment because it gives me the false sense that someone needs me, even though they only need me for the financial aspect. If I disappeared the only loss anyone would experience would be my paychecks, and oh boy does that cut deep. In every other aspect, I'm useless and unnecessary. I drink pretty often, which I know doesn't help, but it's the only thing that makes me feel good. If I go out, that's always going to be a good way to do it. I don't even want to feel sorry for myself. But I don't want to feel this way anymore and there's no sign of a resolution to it. I want to die so very much and I have so many ways I can do it, but I'm not doing it yet for some unidentifiable reason. But I don't know how long that unidentifiable force will be here.

Your worldview PERMITS and ENCOURAGES these worthless gaping syphilitic whore beasts.  You not only excuse them, you pretend that whatever is going on in the world is in fact the product of the person complaining.

Why do people have so much better lives?,"It's quite unpleasant to see all these people having far better lives. I almost wish I could be like them. Main issue with me is my physical appearance. It's always been. Won't go in-depth, I've talked about the damn issue so many times before. Basically, I see myself in the mirror, I want to die. I saw myself in the mirror today, and surprise, surprise, I want to die. So I go browsing the web, I find all these good-looking people doing what good-looking people do, talking about being good-looking and how they pity the ugly, how life must be impossible for them. They're right. It's impossible. I personally really can't take it much longer. Odd thing is, I don't even feel sad or depressed or anything. I just feel really empty and alone, with that weird pressure in my throat. I know I can't do anything about my face, and I know I just got unlucky for some fucking reason (whole family is attractive), and I guess I've sort of accepted it as a fact now.But I accepted it in the wrong manner.

"I wish I was dead, or never born.","Since I can remember I have always known that I don't belong, one of the first things I can clearly remember was my fathers hate of me, his anger that I was even a being. His disgusted looks at me made him harm me and witness the evils of a mans capabilities.I am free of his gaze and feel nothing for him, yet since I was 3 I have made many attempts and one of the first thoughts of any given day is that 'why am I still alive', and one of the last thoughts of any given day is 'I hope I don't wake up'.People around me know of part of my struggles and how I feel, but they see me wanting to commit suicide as a selfish act, like most people do, but to me what's selfish is wanting someone around, who is suffering and see no end to that suffering. I understand why people commit suicide and I don't think they are selfish, we all just want the pain to go away and for some the only way to do so is to commit suicide, what's selfish about that?I believe that I am here to suffer and endure. I am a witness to humanity and I've seen every facet of the evil in a person. Very rarely I see goodness and kindness, and even then I question if it's for selfish reasons.We are all selfish beings who want what we want, I hate that aspect of myself.My first attempt was at aged 3 (yes 3 you read correctly) I set alight my bed as I knew fire purged wrong's from the world. As the fire licked at my skin it did not burn, and simply was extinguished.Another attempt was around 12 when knowing how to tie knots and the tensile strength of the rope I used, I could achieve the goal of ending my suffering. A proper tight noose was tied and as I kicked the chair over the beam supporting my weight, the rope snapped as though someone swung a sword. the strands of rope were cleanly cut, yet what I witnessed was an impossibility just as I saw 9 years previous.A year or so later at aged 14 I was walking back from school, and there was a high walking bridge that went across a dual-carriageway, I stopped and knew it was time for me to try once more and so I stood over the railings and let go. The reason I am able to write about this today is because my foot was caught in the railing, leaving me hanging upside down like in the cartoons when a character is trapped by another. Managing to get myself up with the aid of another I simply limped home with a somewhat twisted ankle. I told the person that a bully had tried to throw me over.Other attempts have included poison's, stepping out in front of vehicles (yes this is a bad one but when your in that mindset you don't care) I have and never would attempt to jump in front of a train (that's just not right, having someone clean miles long tracks).It would appear that I am here for something, as every attempt I make is circumvented somehow.There is a lot I could write or say to my story but I guess I am still searching for a cure to my suffering and pain. I am in receipt of medical help and support though I feel that currently there is no new information that I don't already know, or could find for myself. A long and slow process I am sure.

I have always known I would die by my own hand,"Short version. I am a 54yo female. Abused sexually. physically, and emotionally from age 3-16, multiple actors.  Tried to kill my self for the third time (many previous cries for help) in July.  Cannot get it done. Husband now has memory loss, and am caring for 91yo mother. Have no friends left, and my family has never been there for me.  Husbands friends and family have either died or abandoned us in another way. I also have multiple medical problems, the worst of which are spinal stenosis, and lumbar spondylosis which cause chronic pain for which they will not give me any opiates due to my psych history.  Neither hubby nor I can work, and live on less than $1,700/month on SS disabilityMy psychiatrist, and therapist, have become complacent.  Psych had a fairly good med combo, but it did not keep the last attempt at bay. Therapists is okay, but mostly I think that she is amused by me; not in a bad way though. She just doesn't direct the conversation, or make me work on anything.  Neither suggested hospitalization after this most recent event. They do not know everything about my past, mostly just the light molestation by my stepdad, but everything about my present.My PCP I rarely see, and her NP is virtually useless.  This was not always true, prior to their takeover by a corporate hospital group.  They used to actually listen, but have no time, and their hands are tied as far as options.  They are aware of my attempts, but not my upbringing.I guess I am just tired of trying, and getting it wrong.  First real attempt was when I was 18.  Just married, had an affair with hubbys bff, and realized that leaving my childhood home did not solve all of my problems. Pills and booze, not recognized by anyone as an attempt, so not hospitalized.Second attempt was after the hubby had an affair with our bff, and she said she was pregnant with his baby.  Due to my childhood I cannot have kids, so the pregnancy was the kicker.  That was an attempted asphyxiation. Think those guys they find 'hanging,' but I was not masturbating.This last time I took almost six times the lethal dose of a medication that I am on (not commonly used for suicide) and all I got was two knees bruised so badly that I could not walk for 3 days, and I spent two of those days hallucinating.

"I can't live in this world, ok? It's too much. It's too bad and too evil and I can't handle it anymore.","There's so,  much more evil in the world than good. Almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world, or people actively contribute to it. People harass, hate and kill each other for no reason. People get killed by natural disasters and most people don't give a shit at all. They just think ""whatever, better them than me"" and move on with their lives. Homeless people die in the streets and people think they're asleep and step over them after they were already ignored their whole lives. People out there do good but they could never keep up with the evil and suffering that goes on. Destroying things is way easier than fixing them, so the people killing and destroying will always be ahead. And as the world population grows this will only get worse and worse.People are evil or apathetic and they don't care that people around them are dying and suffering as long as it isn't them. People only care about their own money, feelings, goals etc. The minority of people who dedicate their time to helping people can never do enough no matter how great they are.

Oh where to begin...,"I've been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth  This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family, and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird, out there, bad, ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me. But I just shrugged it off and kept on going.  Then in middle school I started getting bullied, couldn't walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy. Then I was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit. But I just kept going.And then in 8th grade I went back to school, and finally made friends. People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me. But I actually made friends.Then in high school everything got better at first, I had tons of friends who I considered family. I wasn't being bullied (to my face). And I was actually happy.Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia. I became extremely irritable, I was sleeping in class, wasn't shaving, dressing like shit and so on. Well I didn't know this at the time but my cyclothymia (""lesser"" version of bipolar disorder) had kicked into 12th gear. What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist. So I was getting medication. But can you guess what meds I was getting? Just anti-depressants. And for those who don't know, ADs + cyclothymia or bipolar disorder = (in my case) hypomania. What fun. Basically for 3 years I was mostly hypomanic. I'm sure you can all guess what this was like.  Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance, this got mistook for narcissism. And a certain (true narcissist) didn't like this. So he went around to all my friends (who I considered family) and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me. Which of course I didn't, I saw almost all of them as my equal.  And then it gets better, he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together. But there's no scar. So I must be lying. Even tho it did really happen. I'll find a way to prove it to you if you don't believe me. . He told everyone this. So practically overnight my family was gone.  My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope, I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep. The fallout is obvious.  So I'm left alone, addicted to xanax, going fucking mad from sleep deprivation, and I dropped out of high school.  9 months later I had a nervous breakdown, cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder. I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls. Smoking tons of weed to cope. Struggling with xanax and ativan. And I have no one. Not a single person.What's the point.

"Colleague/Friend of mine is leaving hints, not sure how to take it from there","So a girl I work with has rapidly become a great friend, even a bit more. She's been leaving kind of heavy hints that she has suicidal thoughts and even a plan ; she told me she had another 4 months, that she can't wait for it to end, that she understands she's something for her friends and entourage but that she's had enough.I'm not exactly sure what I should do in that regards, should I contact the suicide hotline in my region? Should I tell her? I feel like I'd betray her but all I want is her safety above all. Should I listen more and confirm before? We'll talk later tonight, I've read the 2 posts in the sidebar.I'm pretty sure I'll be able to relate with her and use some of the tips that were in the ""Concerned but don't know what to say"" post, I was in a pretty dark place in the last few months, I just don't know how to proceed next.

When suffering is too great,"I would like to start by saying that, although brief, I would need a million words to encompass the suffering I have endured in the past 3 years.I am currently at a stage where I am thinking about committing suicide daily, and frequently at that. I have even tried desensitizing to various methods, drowning etc by imagining them in depth. The level of suffering has increased to a stage where I believe that I could overcome the thought of hurting people that I love, because my suffering has greatly exceeded it. As you are probably well aware, the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring child's or family suicide is unbearable for them. The grief it would cause my mother, who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great.My problems may seem unbelievable, but I assure you everything I am about to tell you is the truth, not embellished in the slightest.When I was 17 I moved south in the UK to study. During that time I fell ill with mild depression and anxiety. Nothing out of sorts, just mills problems. Looking back now, it was probably the happiest time of my life. I lived well with 4 other people and managed socially and at university. I worked regularly at health shops and other retail shops.By the third year of my course I had experimented heavily with drugs. This was fine, I was fine. I smoked cannabis regularly and was often in a blissful state at the end of the day, no worries.I fell into homelessness after my degree ended like a daydream or a fever. I had many friends, this wasn't something to worry about. I relished in this until things became serious. I stayed at multiple people's flats for months on end, supplying them with food to help. I was oblivious to my immediate situation and when the last person I knew and a good year of sofa surfing had ended  I was stranded. By the time it had ended, I was only barely aware of the way I had been coping and that was with multiple opiates and cannabis. By the end of this period I had developed pretty severe social anxiety, characterised by sensorimotor OCD and an inability to communicate with new people without being completely aware of my expressions and movements.I had no option of my family helping me (already asked for way to much) and I turned to the local authorities. I was addicted to painkillers, unable to find a place to stay and lost. I eventually ended up in a hostel, and by all accounts was an absolute godsend. I lived with other temporarily homeless people and began working within the TJX industry. Now with relatively few people I knew, I didn't learn any of the things a person should try if thru felt depressed, angst or other side. Nobody taught my how to cope. I continued opiate abuse and eventually quit my job. I was offered a move on ""flat"" by BHT a local charity and it turned out to be the worst decision I could possibly have made.I would like to say now that this was BLISS compared to what I experience right now. Nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental torture that was to come.This next section is something wrote about 4 months ago. I would like you to read this and then I may continue. I will mark the section.My progression from a functioning human being to a total social recluse who is both now chronically physically and mentally unwell was rapid. There will be no exaggeration or embellishment in my writing and everything I say is true. I'm glad I have found this place.Following my university course, and subsequent mental health issues and drug abuse, I went through anxiety to anxiety, chronic depression to psychosis. None of the things that I just mentioned, while serious, even touch how much I have suffered in the last year of my life due to my living conditions, random illness and unlucky circumstances. I truly didn't know what suffering was until this time.A few years after my degree I wasn't doing to well and I became homeless after I failed to find a house after I was sharing with others. I had a few minor friends that let me stay at their house, but nobody I was especially close to or a base in which I could reclaim my life. At this point I would like to mention, that while I do have family, I rarely have contact with them due to differences. At that point there is no circumstance where I would have been able to live at home.��Things progressed and I was declared homeless and sought hostels in a housing association in Brighton called BHT. I worked in retail and paid a portion of my rent and was getting better physically and emotionally and decided it was time to move. BHT had a scheme in place where they would help you find somewhere to live and one day when the support workers came over (as per usual on Wednesday), they laid out in the table what was to be the worst thing that ever happened to me.I was shown an 'experimental' housing project that consisted of shipping containers, much like those used in Holland for students. We were provided with artist impressions and it looked very clean. Best of all there we NO deposits or rent in advance and the full �657 rent was to be covered in full by the local housing benefit. I was immediately interested and began building a portfolio, which was required to sign up and and interview was to be taken.��I did all the necessary paperwork and was invited to a group meeting with other tenants who has signed up. When I arrived we were briefed for a couple of hours. We were told about the location, how we would pay electricity etc. I made a good impression an was accepted and all the arrangements were made to move in.This is when it all began.My first experience with the containers was an ugly one. Not only were they nothing like the artists impression, they were stuffed in front of a metal scrap yard and a pub which had just been demolished. I later found out that it was because of unsafe chemicals in the earth below the pub. These containers stuck out like a sore thumb and all I could think of when moving in was how much like prison it looked. Boy was I right. But I had no right to complain, I had nothing and nowhere to go, this was a lot better than living on the street, or so I thought.About a month after I moved in the antics began. I remember after night of drunks and drug addicts screaming, shouting a fighting courtyard. People smashing up parts of the containers and ripping off postboxes. The front of the containers was a showcase to the road and with both front and back being glass windows (the whole piece, with a door). Since there was no lock or fob system, people from Friday night and Saturday night poured in and caused havoc. It is situated just at the end of London road, probably the worst part of the city. There is no gap between the containers, they are all lined up like prison cells and stacked straight in top of each other with corrugated stairs.People would stare and take pictures in the day. and they would mock me and trample around my front door in the evening. Nobody's business was their own, if my neighbours were partying, everonr else had to put up with it and the stairs would fill with people jacking up or cracking up.��I distinctly remember feeling utterly hopeless and alone one night when a group of men came to the top floor and stood looking at the road from outside my door. They had obviously been on a night out and some were drunk. I remember the words outside my container. ""If I lived here I would jump of this floor and kill myself"" and preceded to laugh and joke about what low life's must be here.A year later and things were getting atrocious. Violent neighbours and their visiters ran rampage over the whole project. Every night was the worse than I could have imagine. Screaming, fighting, stabbings, rape and everything in between became normal. People would trash thier whole flats and scatter glass over the courtyard, and throw all of their rubbish in the bit just beside the containers. I would never have been able to dream up this madness. When I mean there were people screaming for hours on end, I mean it LITERALLY. Residents absolutely off their minds running round naked and shouting at the TOP of their lungs for hours and hours on end. Men assaulting women and there were cases of rape also. People flats were rushed for people seeking revenge for missed drug money. The place was completely out of control and the visits from the police and ambulances were so frequent, every one I heard go by I though was for the containers. This was EVERY day and night, no exception. Two people committed suicide.I have had people try my handle I was sleeping, try and break my door down and rush a flat I was speaking to a neighbour in looking to kill or beat to a pulp someone who has nothing to do with me. I had people asking me for money I. A daily basis and the walk up to my flat was hell with residents heckling me and wanting anything and everything from me.I made one friend there who was poet and wanted to help him record. He set up an anxiety talk in his flat for the good residents and we all made our case to the housing association and got many signatures for a petition to help with the project.We had frequent meetings with Andy Winter the CEO of BHT. We all spilled our hearts out about how bad it was living here and how security cameras a gate lock etc needs to be set up. Past the unrelenting crime and hellish neighbours was the cold. These containers got COLD in the winter and the insulation was awful and the heaters were pathetic little ceramic tiles that did nothing. The electricity was on a meter system and I was spending at least �30 just being warm. Bare in mind most of these people got about 120 every two weeks from the job centre. The housing association did NOTHING for about a year, when they finally implemented wooden insulation.I had a meeting with Caroline Lucas (MP of Brighton) personally in a food bank I would vistit and she was sympathetic but there was little she could do to help. A few residents practically declared war on BHT, and rightly so. They had ruined our lives and now where ignoring our cries for help, because of they did acknowledge the huge failure that the project was they would probably be shut down. I went to numerous newspapers whom ignored me as they were told they were not allowed to publish our stories. The only one which was actually published was only a few weeks after we moved in and was by my neighbourBy this point I was struggling badly with mental illness again. I was depressed and highly angst with daily panic attacks. It didn't help that the ventilation system was also poorly designed and I receive all of the drug fumes that come form the bottom 5 floors (I'm at the top). This included 'Spice' (now banned in the UK) smoke and I went to hospital frequently with chest pains. ��These fumes filled my flat all day long, so I spent a lot of time walking out of the house.This last year is when the hell occurred.��Someone moved in next door with severe anger issues. He would break the the flat into little pieces and blast his meter high speakers all day and night filed on speed and weed. I would wake up suddenly in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding, panicking due to sudden slams or smashes against my wall. There is barely any space between the walls. I began to have sleeping problems and insomnia that started worsening everything else. Complaints were made to no avail, they tried to evict him bit it didn't work and was a lengthy procedure.He wasn't the problem though, his visitor was. He was another tenant in the project and one that has caused problems before. What started out with a bit of neighbourly chatter tuned out to be the worst mistake of my life. I invited his the other neighbour in to play some video games and while we got along, I stopped inviting him in after it became apparent that he was an absolutely despicable human being. He recently had threatened to beat up a girl that I had to stop and was known to be causing issues, making people feel bad, but wasn't a major problem around the block. It became clear to me that this man was a secret demon. He began knocking door hard in the morning and after ignoring him for weeks I would eventually answer and tell him I don't want to see him. He would take this as an oppurtunity for an argument and harass me further. He deluded himself into thinking we were friends and became aggressive when I poiletly told him and Sinhalese to him that we were not. He thought he could do whatever around and in my flat. He stated trying my handle daily, sometimes even without knocking and this went on for months and months and months. I asked him to stop but he wouldn't. I told him my anxiety and insomnia was getting so bad due him and my other birth our that I am going insane. He carried on trying my handle and door daily, sometimes for hours on end. This was the worst. I shouted at him told him to leave numerous times but it carried on. If you have ever had someone debase you on such a level you will know how damaging that is. Someone who dictated when you sleep or wake and knows there is nothing you can do about it because they have nothing to lose and you do. I couldn't fight him because he would probably take it further. The sound of handles going stated to evoke a horrible physical response, one which would affect me for weeks on end.I couldn't call the police because that would put me in a dangerous situation for being a 'snitch'. There was no point in telling my housing association, there is nothing they could have done that wouldn't put me in a worse situation. Along with an already desperate situation and a very loud neighbour and another who took it upon himself to make my life a living hell I began to get seriously physically ill.
��
The present day:I began suffering with horrible fevers and viruses, symptoms that can only be described as like having the flu for months and months last year and they haven't stopped. I had about 10 bloods taken over the course of the year and the doctors can't figure out why I'm the state I am in. When I talk about this I can't stress enough how much I don't mean this lightly. I have had the Nora virus while withdrawing from diazepam and that didn't touch the physical suffering I have had EVERY day for the past year. Raised cortisol and adrenaline have left me incapacitated and completely ravaged my body, I know all of this stress is to blame. Coupled with dreadful hypervigilance and severe insomnia the suffering had been something I wouldn't wish on the most evil person. I began to lost my mind and become so derealised and depresonalized that I don't know how to concentrate or relax. I cant do anything I live like play instruments or listen to music without the content dear that someone might hear and start harassing me. The insomnia has been so bad I have been nearing hospitalization and the only reason I'm here today is that I managed to escape for a few months back to a friend in Gloucestershire. I have wanted to commit suicide for such a long time, but I never will because of how much it would hurt certain family members, even though I do not have contact with them often. Just to be clear, I DONT take alcohol or drugs and haven't for a long while. I eat a very healthy diet and exercise (force myself) daily and practice standing medidtation (pretty much impossible with the though of him being around)For the last 3 months the loud neighbour has been evicted, but the other one (the real problem) is still around. Every time I enter the gate is like the walk of the gauntlet, whether I will see him (he is often around) and have to deal with him. Having gone to my friends house in Gloucestershire I got back to find out I couldn't get back in because someone had tried to break in and snapped something in my lock. I am completely aggrophobic. I never see anyone than people at the supermarket and when I enter the gate I practically run up to my flat, stuff the curtains with cloths (so they can't see the lights when I have them on a night) and make barely any noise at night.��Someone else has moved in and the evil man has started going into his flat talking to him. I can't believe that that after a horribly loud neighbour who attached the evil man I'm the first place has now been evicted, the next one is also inviting him up and will probably soon give the man a reason to start knocking me again under the guise of friendship. I know he is around because I hear him shouting laughing outside my flat and I know he has knocked me once or twice in the last week.Just after Christmas, I did everything I could to move to a different county. I found the only place that I had a possibility of moving to was Bournemouth and an agency called DWP housing, due to their low fees and no deposit. I got a citizen's card and went there took the form in and they accepted my referencing. I was invited to view a flat when I received a call from the wan I was dealing with saying they wouldn't be corresponding with me any further. I found out that my housing association had been talking with her and told her I was in rent arrears, which I was not. I was in water debt and service charge with confused her. But she didn't ask me before sending the emails and ruined my chances.��
I have been to the council, the waiting list is unbelievably long, even with medical needs. Everywhere else I have been wants �1200+ in fees/deposit which I currently have no way of saving. Because of living in a hostel (even though I am 25) I am now entitled to the one bed rate of any country, unless I move into shared, in which case that privilege will be revoked.At this point I don't care where I go, I would happily take anywhere else in the country, whether it be a hostel or otherwise.��Every day is a battle to keeping on going and I have no one sleds to talk to.That's was what I wrote a while ago in a forum dealing with neighbours.Following the containers, I was able to get a loan and finally move out of them for good. I move to another part of the country, completely on my own, didn't know anyone at all.I since have developed a depersonlization disorder following the end of the containers. I became so detached, I may have walked on separate occasions for 20 odd miles a day for months. It occurred one night last Christmas when I returned from a visit to my family's house. It's an absolute miracle that I was able to leave, and I was so optimistic that I began doing everything in my power to make myself well. I eat a perfect diet, I exercise daily and do everything I can.The chronic insomnia stayed and the dissociative symptoms have reached a point where my awareness levels are very worrying and borderline insane. I spend whole days trying to take on various stimulus took regain awareness. I try to take in sounds a sights, but everything has lost meaning. I can't appreciate a beautiful lake or a song, because I'm not here or there, I'm nowhere. I feel like some sort of  blood supply has been cut to important regions of my mind that I can only beg for help about.The fevers randomly come and go, even away from the containers and most days I wake up feeling physically awful. I cannot control my body temperature and wake up, I feel flu like again and again, which is how it began before.My muscles ache unbearably all day, I have to walk slow and when I exercise I do it out of fear of death.My body is simply fucked and no doctor can explain it. I clearly have something wrong but it can't be explained, probably because it is so complex or a virus so deep, it can't even be found. I have had over 20 blood tests in the last year. Around two weeks ago I developed a very loud tuning in my ears. It is severe tinnitus that is making everything I do meaningless. The last thing that I had in the world after moving was peace and quiet at night and that had been taken from me. There is no sight of it going and it didn't follow acoustic trauma. I can see myself rapidly declining in the past few weeks. This is becoming a joke. I have begun to think that this is some sort of test. I am being referred to a new psychiatrist,a sleep clinic and the community psychiatric team in my area and hopefully a neurologist.I now have no friends and speak to family maybe once a month.I exist only because I don't want to hurt those who may feel pain from my death. I love my 97 year old grandmother too much to burden her in her last year's and my mother would be distraught.I am approaching a stage where my suffering is so great, that there would have been numerous times that if I'd had access to a gun, I would definitely would have killed myself. The fear of drowning, hanging or falling is great.I want to die, I want others to accept that I want to die. I have been looking into possible euthanasia. I am close to the end.If you have read that all, I thank you that is all I ask.",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2
Most suicidal day of my life,"I'm a dramatic and angry person. I'll never know why I'm here and how to make the best of it. But I can see so many other people doing such a great job. My only issue is I like to do something perfectly or throw it away. That feeling extend to everything. As soon as I fail or someone makes me realise I have an ugly side...I want to throw myself away. Easier said than done. But the feeling never really fully fades,  this frustration at all of the things I can't take back or fix,  and have to live with for the rest of my life. I'll never claim perfection and I know that's impossible but other people seem to do pretty well. I'd like to meet their standards at least. Most of the time I can not care but some days it all just piles on. Getting help hasn't worked. Taking time out just distracts briefly and is a cover up. This is me. Forever. That's a hard thing to take. I know it's hard to understand,  but that's who I am. It's who I've always been. I can't fix this. I'm broken permenantly. I don't know what to do. Counselling didn't work.
Nothing works.
I spent the whole day crying over a mistake. I stayed in bed. I didn't want to face the people in my house,  so I didn't eat dinner. Am I being too dramatic?  Maybe.

The conclusion of me.,"The silence is loud. Louder than anything Ive ever heard. It pierces my ears and impregnates my mind. It tells me about myself. I drown it out with the loudest, angriest music I know. I dont know if I feel emotion anymore. I search for the disgusting and disturbing, to prod my heart. I want it to beat again. I want to feel the warmth of my blood, flowing through my veins. It works for a short period, but Im slowly becoming desensitized. I shock myself with my own thoughts. If the inner workings of my mind are a representation of my soul, then I am malevolent. I crave violence and hatred. I wish I was more hated than I am, because then maybe these feelings would be justified, but Im loved by all who meet me. I hate being loved. I deserve nothing and no one. To my daughter, Esli. If your mother loves you at all, she will find someone worthy of your love and hers, and she will omit me from your past. I never deserved either of you. Ive already missed most of your life because of work at this point. I wish I could see you go to your first day of school. Words dont do justice to the amount of love I have for you and your brother.To my son, Bronson. Youre not old enough to know me, which is fortunate for you. Im sorry I will never be there to teach you about life or sports or girls. You deserve a much better father than I could ever be. Your first birthday will be about the time Im supposed to come home from this deployment. I only got you for a month, but every second was worth holding you and your sister and seeing you both smile and laugh. I love you an unfathomable amount.To my wife, Kristen. I took your youth away from you by starting a family with you when we were seventeen and eighteen and making you believe that I was normal for years. The three years we've been married, were the only times in my life that I felt anything remotely close to happiness. This sickness has haunted me since I was a child, and I desperately wanted to be a normal, happy person, but Im too disgusting to deserve that. I want you to know that nothing I feel is your fault, nor the kids fault. Its just the cards Ive been delt. I want you to find someone who will make you happy, because you deserve to be happy with someone who is genuinly happy and will dance with you and will be there for the kids, instead of being gone for for several months or even a year at a time. Nothing I could ever do could make me deserve you; any of you. The guilt I feel for leaving you with a three year old and a six month old may be enough to kill me, before I can.

"Feeling just helpless, wanting to admit myself","So, I went through a very bad year of depression about 1.5 years ago and it's suddenly back. I always feel lost and hopeless and like my life is changing for the worse when it never is. I want a break from everything, and atm the only way I can see that happening is if I kill myself.  I'm back into self harm after that 1.5 clean streak. I don't know what to do. At least it's not as frequent or bad as it used  to be. I want to admit myself to a psych ward but that requires my dad knowing, and I'm not legitimately mentally ill enough to go. I'm probably just attention seeking. So that's not an option.

I can't do the first because family is over for the next few weeks.I have a lot of supportive friends but I feel attention seeking when I ask for help, as much as they tell me I'm not.

What to Do?,I'm usually here helping other people but today I need help. Been struggling with depression for two years and my antidepressants have stopped working now.

Don't know how to keep going any more,"Hi
I don't really know how to start this
I just need to get this all down so people know what I'm feeling and why and if there really is any chance for me To get better and if anyone knows how I can be helpedI'm sorry that it's so long abd whiny and probably seems disconnected but every little thing adds up even though I know this will Miss out so much and things that I don't feel comfortable sharing
And I'm sorry it's written weirdly and I might make it hard to read
I just don't have the energy to write properly and know that if I try to I will never be able to start or finish becayse that's how it's been for me until nowI just don't see a way out of being hopeless like this
I'm a trans girl and my mental health and everything around me has been getting worse and worse for so longI have trichotillomania and it used to show itself like it does in most people when I was younger and I developed a bald patch because of it, but because of my dysphoria when I started growing facial and body hair it quickly turned into plucking and pulling that as wellBut when the hair started getting darker and thicker I couldn't control how much damage I did to get them out so now my face is covered with scars from digging in with tweezers for hours every day
I just wanted to be able to be pretty and confident with my appearance but now I never will be
I always have been unhappy with how I look but during the times I hadn't got as scarred and stay clean for long enough I was happy with how I looked but now I don't even have that I've researched stuff about how to get over trich but it's made for people that are plucking hair they don't want to lose
For me I need that hair to be gone, even without OCD I wouldn't be able to live properly as myself when I have hair growing out of my face
Shaving isn't good enough Nd I can't afford hair removal I've spent the last year or more almost completely inside, so far longest time without stepping out once is six months
I can't be seen like this and even when I can stop and heal for long enough for makeup to help me go out it's still so hard
Just being trans makes others see me as a freak, let alone everything else I have no contact with my family who I ran away from more than a year ago because it wasn't good for me, especially my mum, who lied to, gaslighted, and blackmailed me, as well as sabotaging my chance of getting help from the gender clinic even if they didnt seem to want to help anyway Ive tried different medications for my depression but everything made me feel weird and worse so I couldn't stand to keep taking them
People say that LSD can help but every time I've done it I've had at best a mildly uncomfortable trip, but my worst led to me going to hospital and traumatised me worse than anything i can remember
But I've taken it a lot because it at least means this life is different
At least for a while I've been in some relationships but I found out about something called relationship OCD that I think describes me quite well and is what lead to most of my break ups
My last girlfriend was the first person I could see in real life and I always looked forward to her visits and she was so good to me but after the bad trip I lost the ability to love like that so I had to leave her
And now she hurts too much to talk
I miss her a lot
I didn't want to hurt her I only have a few other online friends but they have lives of their own and can't talk to me much
I've forgotten how to talk to people other than them and how to make friends
I used to make lots of friends and talk to loads of people, even if only really online, but now I can't do it at allI used to have a lot of electronics and stuff to keep myself entertained at least but even though I know to treat my things well everything has broken and I don't know why
And I cAnt afford to fix anything
I live on disability and housing benefits and what's left after food and everything being delivered goes to collecting trading cards because it means that I at least have something to look forward to and almost enjoy and there's always a chance of something good
A chance I don't feel I really get in any other area of my life
It gives me something to focus on
Even if my OCD makes collecting toxic sometimes And I get self conscious for feeling childish
But at least it's something I wish I could save to fix things or get a laptop or something so I could make art again or play games but without lots of small things to look forward to to keep me going I would suffer a lot
I once saved up for a switch by starving myself and selling things that I didn't really want to sell so that I could enjoy something new but it and the replacement were both faulty and when I traded it in CEX took the trade in price down the day that I arrived there and then put the price down again because I had a screen protector on it so I lost a lot of money on that
I feel like I'm not really allowed to be happy or have good thingsI went to pride pretty soon after I left my family but I got spit on by someone there almost as soon as I arrived, and that was a long time before the hate group arrived
Feels like nowhere accepts meI haven't made any friends since I've moved here other than my roommates but I did try
Talked to someone online and it went really well and was supposed to go to a meet up together with some of their friends but when I arrived they  all didn't say a word to me and after they finished their drinks just left me alone
And I really made an effort I was supposed to move out last month with the roommate I get on with better but nowhere would accept me because I don't work so I'm stuck where I am and they moved out The other roommate isn't a bad person but they had anger outbursts and pushed and broke things in the house when I had moved in not long ago and I never really got over being scared of her I once attempted suicide
But was found before I had taken many pills
I went to the hospital anyway and said that I need help and that I think it would be best if I were to be sectioned
But they said that if I Kill myself it's my responsibility and they refused to help meOne of my online friends recruited some of her friends that are good at helping others and know what to do and are quite good activists and stuff like that and one of them is the reason I was able to run away at all
But after a while they all seemed to give up on me
They knew how bad it was and said they'd help and then nothing
I know they do a lot and I don't expect them to drop everything they do for me and I appreciate what they have done
But it hurt more to be dropped like that than not told would be helpedI feel like I'm not allowed to be happy
When I was a kid I got bullied a lot and especially when I was in primary school
Spent at least one year with no friends at all
And when I did get happy or excited I ended up extremely ill
Which i think still happens now
I once ended up in hospital the night before my birthday and I always got ill somehow before most good thingsI was in college for a year and a bit
I got a distinction in my first year but knew I wouldn't be able to cope in a level 3 course because I barely got through that so I took another level 2 in something else but I got kicked out because I couldn't handle it A lot of the time when people try to help me they think I'm trying to be difficult and get frustrated and give up on me
But I promise I do my best it's just that so little seems to work for meAll I've been able to think about lately is self harm and suicide
Wanted to kill myself since I was 8
Only reason I haven't started cutting again is don't have anything shark enough
And usually too scared to try and kill mysskf
But so close to breaking point
Don't know what to do I really do try my hardest to make things better and I know my best isn't that good but I don't feel like I deserve this life
I always try my best to be good even if I don't always succeed
I don't know what else to do
I want to be able to be happy and be confident and go outside and be accepted and have s life and friends i can share good times with I really miss going outside ",A2,0.85,"The text indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and struggles with mental health and dysphoria, alongside self-harming behaviors (trichotillomania).

Apparently I'm hated/not welcome anywhere.,"In a matter of 3 months, I got kicked out from every forum and abandoned by every friend.Up to yesterday I was staff in a website, today I get kicked out and framed. Since I was pissed I deleted some of the files on the FTP but they changed the ip and restored everything. I realized I would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via FTP but I didn't realize that  until after. I got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff. For example in one of them, I created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own. That caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales. I felt better that he couldn't monetize from that any longer. This led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do, or actual staff applications. Another forum incident was, I was selling another one of my programs, of course no license since I'm lazy to add that in. This guy buys it, and shares the license with his friend. Once something went wrong with the program, he , his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down. Then he demanded I help him and his friends and I refused due to him breaking my purchase policies. The staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refunding/fixing his program.For the friend part, I stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them ( 3-4 ). In short, I realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me. I like being kind of a leader, saying what to do , what not to do and what I should do instead of them. Such as, let's drop there ( PUBG ) or let me be that character since you don't really know how to use it ( rainbow six siege ). All my online friends found other friends to talk to / play with/ code with. My best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me. The only times he invites me out, I actually can't meet him due to me being with my girlfriend ( being the weekends. )Basicly now I have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code. But what is the point of coding if I can't sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums. I go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am. The only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap. She basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted. I don't know why on the contrary everyone else hates me and wants me to be gone. Being hated by everyone means I can't sell my creations or have anything to talk about with anyone. On the forums part I can't let anyone take advantage of me and step on me and control what I do. What is wrong with me in your opinion? I really want to get better and be liked by the majority rather than hated by the majority.",A1,0.8,"The text reflects frustration, social rejection, and potential impulsive behavior, but does not indicate immediate harm to self or others.

Was about to kill myself but realized it was probably going to be a slow death so I stopped,"I was in my bed, re-thinking everything wrong with me and my current lifestyle. I was looking up ways to kill myself without making it seem like I did it on google when this thought passed through my head. What if I just suffocate myself to death with a pillow? That way, there's maybe the chance that everyone was going to take that as me dying because I fell asleep on a weird position. So I put my head on the pillow, started breathing and just waited. I was running out of air when I stopped. I assume I inhaled some carbon dioxide, seeing as I started breathing heavily when I pulled out. I guess I couldn't wait that much, would've been a very slow death. This just happened. I don't know what to do or think right now.

The only reason I'm not homeless is my parents haven't kicked me out yet.  I can't stand living here with them though.

I've always done only what others expect of me, but I've never really wanted more for my life anyway. I've tried therapy, a few medications, none of it has been right for me.

"I want to die, notes are already written to send to loved ones. Reasons to live no longer outweigh the reasons to die. I don't want to exist anymore.","Throwaway for very obvious reasons:Hey Reddit,I don't know how to be able to word this properly or make any sense of what I'm writing but I will do my best. Long story short, I'm at my wits end and want to die. The following is going to be a LOT of verbal diahhrea so just bear with me.I have had mental issues most of my life, mostly dealing with depression. My mom wanted me to see a therapist from a very early age but my dad (prideful newfie that he was) never agreed to it. So most of my issues went unchecked and was just chalked up to just me being ""how I was"". Fast forward to two years ago and it caused me to lose my significant other, and I became homeless. We have a kid together that I haven't seen for almost a year now. I have been sleeping on couches ever since.Because of all of this, it was like Pandora's Box exploded in my head. Everything that I held in for years suddenly all came out at once. I because wreckless because I just stopped caring. I took out loans to be able to afford a place of my own (I've stayed at friends houses on their couches since), and when it seemed like things were somewhat looking up for me I lost my job. I ended up having to use the loan money to pay for myself to survive while waiting for unemployment to kick in.I have been homeless for two years, haven't seen my kid in almost a year and I miss her so much it kills me. Since my seperation my relationship with my ex isn't good. We had tension since we broke up (our relationship by the end was a fucking train wreck but that's an entire story in and of itself) and when I was able to take my daughter on weekends I had difficulty taking care of her. Like I said with my mental issues I couldn't function at all, let alone take care of a 1-2 year old. So we changed it to visits. Visits became fewer until she wanted me to sign her over because apparently me being the way I was was detrimental to my daughter so it was thought to be best that I back off. It took a month for me to make a response, and I did by email. I explained that I wanted to be part of my daughter's life and wanted to be there for her. That I was trying to get better to be the man she needs me to be. There was just too much to say by text. She never responded, I know she got the email because I've sent her emails before, and she does check that email because she has cancelled any attempt for me to send her money to help with my daughter. I can no longer afford to send money and have given up on that since every attempt to send money has resulted in it being declined and I am charged every time I try to do so.I had to go from one friend's house to another friend's house (I've been at each friend's house for a year now, and the friend I'm with now can't really deal with me being here. He's not said too much minus one email saying he is hoping I find another place to stay, but hasn't said anything since). I've given up at this point. I've been diagnosed with severe depression, type 2 bipolar, and borderline personality disorder. Meds aren't helping. I've been told before I can even start therapy I have to try to find a place to live that I cannot afford (My therapist is suggesting I try to find a place first because if I have a home of my own it would reduce my stress greatly). I've sent in an application for disability (therapist/dr's recommendation) but it could take up to three months to process. I have no money, my paltry social assistance can't help me afford a place, I can barely afford to eat. I'm also a binge/emotional eater (Being referred to an eating disorder's clinic, so eating my depression definitely doesn't help with money). I'm on a wait list for affordable housing but that can take years (I'm on an emergency list because I'm homeless, but it doesn't really help with wait time). I'm ready to give up, I can't deal with this anymore. My daughter used to be the only reason to keep going but now she's gone. My ex got a new boyfriend 3 months after breaking up with me and apparently my daughter calls him daddy now. So she might just be better off without me. I've got lamotrigine I can O/D on, there's a bridge not too far away. I'm just trying to decide between the two. before anyone says anything I've already read what a lamotrigine overdose can do. And I've read what suicide by falling/drowning can be like, but I am past the point of caring.Thanks for listening, sorry for the wall of text. There's lost of stuff I haven't included (mostly because it could be a little too specific, but there's a LOT more going on). Hopefully it wasn't too much.TLDR; My life is in shambles.

Did I cause this,"Here goes... why am I here? Because I drove my husband to end his life, that's why. It's a long story but you need to read it all to understand. We had 11 years together (9 married) and two children (2 and 7). I gave him hell for the first few years, interrogating him over his exes (silly really as they were so brief) and jealousy, in return he was violent. Things improved, violence stopped, we got married, had our first child, and a relatively normal marriage until 2015. Second child born 2015, a child my husband didn't want but had agreed to have to keep me happy. He fell in love with her when she was born. A few months later, he met his best friend and went from someone who NEVER went out to someone who started going out all night getting drunk. It caused problems, I hated him rolling in at 3am drunk. He refused to compromise. He then discovered the debt I'd been hiding from him, and the enormous lies I'd told to cover it up. He smashed up the house. The police came and warned him. 2016 was a horrible year - lots of months we were together and fine, lots of months we were split up but living together. I was vile to him, looking back at the emails/texts I would say emotionally abusive. He was no angel, he was the same but not as bad. It ended well and xmas was lovely. He mentioned that he thought I was poisoning his food - I thought he was joking but he would feed it to our toddler to make sure I didn't poison it!! 2017 January I discovered him trying to purchase suicide equipment, confronted him and he admitted it, saying it was because I was ""mental and always making up stch, that i'd yelled it so the neighbours called the police etc. The next day I stayed in a hotel with the kids, emailed him a long email about the smack, his behaviour on holiday and in general and how I wanted him to leave. The weekend he stayed in bed, didn't move at all even for food. I thought he might be shutting down again for suicide, but then he started recording himself so I put it down to him playing games. He later admitted he was recording himself to prove to the police he was innocent. I threw him out when he went to work on Monday and he stayed in a hotel. He went to work as normal on Tuesday then purchased the items and completed suicide in the early hours of Wednesday 19th. So why is it my fault? Several reasons. According to his note, he did it because he couldn't live in fear of false prosecution or being attacked, that I was the abuser but I'd taken the kids from him, that he had nothing left and I won. The rest of the note was a list about giving his money only to the kids, begging whoever found him to check his phone for messages/emails as they would tell them ""all they need to know"" followed by a desperate plea ""please save my girls from that monster!"" and finally, an apology to the kids for him not being able to protect them from me but that he loves them always. Then there was a separate note with a long list of domestic abuse I'd apparently done to him. Some of it was true, like me being OCD and not letting him cook/clean. Some if it was lies, like me threatening to kill him. Some of it was twisted versions of events, like me pushing him through the stairs when in reality he'd smashed them up. Some of it was calculated lies like him not being allowed to look at women in underwear on tv which sounds worse than the truth which was that I had a problem with porn. Then here's the confusing part - he chose a method that is 100% quick, painless and guaranteed. He did it miles from home, but went as far as setting phone reminders (his memory is shocking) to remind him to leave out his suicide note and driving licence. He wiped his phone of everything apart from the emails he wanted to be seen, he even deactivated facebook and wiped his dash camera. Lots of trivial little things he knew I'd obsess about. Which I did, as there are several hours unaccounted for. He had enough money in his wallet (which he'd been secretly hiding) to move out and rent somewhere, he refers to this in his note as his ""escape fund"" but doesnt use it? He deleted selected whatsapp messages from his friend but not all of them? He'd wanted to go on an all-nighter the day after he smacked our child but his friend was busy - I feel that he NEEDED the escape despite the arguments itd cause, but he couldnt go. I will hold my hands up here and say that MANY MANY times I threatened to have him arrested for his violence (meaning previous violence but he assumed otherwise) and I threatened he'd only see the kids in a contact centre. BUT I never actually did these things. In the two occasions we split up, he saw the kids at home or in public. Yes to be fair it wasn't enough (the week I left he took them for dinner, the two weeks he left he saw them for a few hours on the 13th day since he'd left). I always backed down and let him see them. I did have photos of bruises on my phone but these were to show my doctor as I kept bruising easily. He refused to believe this. I have no idea where the paranoia about being beaten up came from as I never threatened this, or at least don't recall doing so, though that person is the type of person who would beat people up. But yes I did control him seeing the kids and in 2016 during the months we split I excluded him from our outings which must have been depressing for him, but in my defence we were meant to be split up. I did call him an alcoholic as he'd gone from never ever drinking to drinking several days, not to get drunk but always drinking. Since his death I discovered he'd not been taken away from his best friend like he led me to believe, as they had drinks after work every monday, lunch together every day. He led me to believe that he never saw him anymore because I'd stopped his all-nighters. I also discovered hidden wage slips like he'd thought about leaving before. I also discovered that of all the occasions he went out drinking, only 4 of those were with his friend, the rest he'd gone alone (he only had that one friend, and apparently had texted him a couple of times when he was already out asking him to join him). I feel alcohol was his escape. So how did I kill him? Well imagine hearing his version. He works hard all day so that I can stay home. I take the p*ss by racking up debt and lying (the lies hurt more than the debt). The eldest is screaming, the youngest having a tantrum, your wife's in a mood and then makes something up to have a go at you about. Your only escape is drinking all night but your wife won't let you do that. So you drink at home and she calls you an alcoholic. Every argument she throws the previous violence in your face. She emotionally abuses you daily. Every argument she threatens to call the police and have you arrested and/or removed from the family home. She threatens to have you sent to prison. Every time you argue, she says you'll only see your kids in a contact centre. You genuinely believe she will tell whatever lies she has to in order to take the kids from you and get you in prison. There's no escape. If you leave she can still tell the lies and you won't see your kids. Courts side with mums.

Life is kicking my ass,"I'll try to summarize where my life is at right now. In about 3 months time, I've fucked everything up and I'm at a place right now where for the first time in my life, I can't find anything to keep me afloat. First of all, I'm 29. In May this year, I lost my job, and I didn't find a new job immediately. I had some trips and festivals planned this summer, and since I got fired I had some security with an unemployment income. In June, I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. This had been planned for a while. It cost me some money of course, and the apartment was a bit more expensive than the previous one. Over the summer, a long string of bad decisions lead to serious financial trouble. I started abusing my credit card, spending money I didn't have. Right now, my balance is at -3500 EU, and my bank called me up to announce that I have to clear this debt by September 15th. I cancelled an upcoming vacation, and furiously started looking for a job. It's been harder than I expected, and right now I don't have the time to get that money, so my breathing space is decreasing one day at a time. I've been trying to keep it together and build things up again constructively, but I've been suffering. I'd been investing a lot of time in this girl I met, and there was a real prospect of a relationship. Once I didn't decide to go on the vacation, she kind of kicked me when I was down and made things worse by throwing all kinds of insults and blames at me. Obviously, this is not the kind of person I need in my life so I broke this off instantly. Yesterday, my roommate announced after only 3 months that he doesn't want to live with me anymore because of this insecurity, which I don't blame him for. For the last month now I've been trying to stay positive. I stopped using drugs, stopped smoking, stopped smoking weed, recovered my rhythm, started working out again, dealt with all the shit that had been piling up for months, and I've been looking for a job intensively. Today though, I couldn't keep it together anymore. I'm usually a pretty positive person, and I've always enjoyed some uncertainty in my life as I was always able to see new opportunities in everything. For the first time now, I don't have any security and I can't seem to find anything that gives me the energy to continue. I know all of this has been my own fault, as I've been running away from my problems way too long. A lot of people whom I considered friends (the girl and the roommate to start with, but all the other friends I planned on going on the vacation with too) have been dropping me like I have some infectious disease. There is not a single aspect of my life that isn't shitty right now. My financial situation is dramatic, I'm out of options and time is running out. I don't know where I'm gonna live in a few months, or how I'm even gonna pay for it. The prospect of a relationship has all of a sudden disappeared, a lot of my ""friends"" are gone, the job hunt is giving me one disappointment after the other... And right now I just can't see a way out. My life is in the gutter, and any prospect I had is now gone. For a few weeks now, I've been fighting thoughts of suicide. But every time I worry about my situation, I end up with only one possible solution. Every time I come to that solution, it's becoming harder and harder to fight that thought. Today I broke down completely and just started crying my heart out, I even started writing a goodbye letter... It's not the first time I've had thoughts about suicide, the circumstances in my life right now have made those thoughts stronger than ever. My biggest problem is that I could never stand the pressure of the expectations that were put on me. I kind of 'ran away' from home years ago to get away from the pressure, but I've realized that my entire life has been an illusion. My true self has been completely overshadowed by this image of myself I projected onto the world, through which I pretended to be able to fulfill those expectations.As a result, I've always struggled with a heavy identity crisis. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, but the problem is that I don't know who I really am. I've been looking deep inside, only to find emptiness... I feel like my true self has died years ago, and I'm a ghost that's merely physically present in this body. I could always cope somewhat with this issue by looking for external distractions, by escaping reality. Through the circumstances of my life at the moment, reality has come crashing in, and I no longer have the energy to pretend. I'm down to my most humble self. I've lost all my will to fight, I'm down on my knees. I just need a fucking break already, but the bad news just keeps piling up. My back is against the wall, and I'm not sure how I'm gonna get out of this. I have a few true friends left who I can talk to about this, but I doubt they realize how bad I'm doing... I guess I just needed some place to vent and be honest about how bad my situation is right now.",A1,0.85,"The individual is experiencing significant financial stress and difficulty finding a job, which warrants monitoring.

Everyone I meet either loses interest and ghosts (probably for someone with not nearly as many red flags as me), or just bolts after one date and says something like ""it was nice meeting up with you, you're sweet but I don't want to meet again"" which really means that they saw seriously wrong with me but didn't want to let me down too hard.

I thought college would make things better,"I'm away at college and I had nothing back home until a year ago.
I was able to escape from my abusive home life and my trauma related to being molested as a kid through dance. My dance teacher became the father I wish I had and I got other mentors along the way too. I even met bill Clinton at one of my performances which was in front of hundreds of people and also got to perform at Madison square garden. But don't get me wrong, life was still hard. I still wanted to kill myself.
I  started fall in love this summer and now he won't talk to me anymore and I had no closure because I was never given a concrete reason. He was the first boy I've met who has treated me how I deserve to be treated and now he's in a different country and it hurts when I think about him. And IM wearing the necklace he wore right now and it's the only thing that makes me feel safe sometimes.
I also lost control and started harming more this summer but nobody knows that because even though I know it's a good idea to get help, reporting this means being in more college debt and suffering at the hands of my family for longer so I'm trying to power through. If getting help was a rational option, I would go for it.
But then I go to college and it's great here because I don't have to regularly interact with the people who molested me and my horrible disgusting excuses for parents as much but my plans fell through and I was misinformed about the dance opportunities available for me on campus. Long story short, there's a possibility I won't even be able to take ballet, let alone hip hop, which is what I took back home and what helped me through dark times. And I hurt my ankles so I can't even dance in my free time just for fun for likely another week at least.
The only true friends I've ever had in the long term are back home. My mentors back home told me to call them when I got to college, but most of them won't even answer my texts. I get that they're busy. They're talent managers and directors and choreographers and higher ups in the business, but they are also the first people I've ever been able to deem real family and we have a deep bond. They are the reason I am who I am today and want to kill myself much less often than before. Especially my dance teacher. Often whenever we said goodbye to each other we would hug and say I love you but now he doesn't even text me to say he can't talk on the phone. I'm not being clingy. I'm trying not to be a bother but I just need them right now. Is just wanting to say hi from time to time irrational?
I feel like I'm losing everyone all over again. This shit has happened twice before.
I have quality friends back home that have changed my life but I'm not comfortable telling them about how I have been abused and how the boy I love and who love(or maybe loved, depending on the reason why he's done this)  stopped looking me in the eye. So I'm just kind of here in college and honestly I had a tough night. I tried out for dance team and I did horribly and hurt my ankles so that's another door closed with dance and also I did a Tibetan bowl meditation and if any of you guys don't understand meditation, just know that this specific kind often lets you see visions and I had a really depressing vision having to do with the boy I love. It had to do with me re meeting a night recently where I was outside in the cold for 3 hours calling anyone I could think of to talk to them about how much I was hurting but nobody answered until the very end of the night. I called all my mentors and still none of them have texted me saying sorry they missed my call.
And people here at college are nice, so much nicer than the people I regularly interact with back home but they don't know me well enough to understand just exactly how this is all tearing at the seems.i thought college would be a better place for me and it was at first but after tonight, it's safe to say that even though some  things got better it evened out cuz now a lot do other things are getting worse.
I haven't let myself self harm in the last few days but it's really hard not to. I don't really see a reason to keep going anymore, and I'm really good at  finding reasons to keep going. If things are gonna be like this for the next four years, I don't wanna stick around because by the time it does get better I'll be too fucked in the head to appreciate it.
I won't kill myself tonight cuz I never do cuz I'm too scared but I'm afraid that I'm gonna hurt myself and get yet another scar and I get really sad when I look at my self harm scars. They are all from this summer.
I don't really want to be alive right now
Sometimes I feel like the only way my dance teacher would send me a message is if he found out I tried to hurt myself and that's what makes this so tempting. The people I miss would actually talk to me more if they heard about me trying to kill myself. I don't want to make them sad because I love them but I'm so fucking desperate just to get a ""hello how are you I'm sorry I haven't bothered to reply to your messages but I still love you"" I'm willing to go to great lengths. I'm scared of myself right now. I know these are toxic thoughts but honestly I'm so desperate to talk to the people I love that trying to end my life is starting to seem worth it.

44 years old and I can't handle aging,"So I'm vain. I used to be very pretty and now I see my body changing and it depresses me so much. I don't have a job so it's not like I can make money to change my body back to its former glory. I could try exercising and dieting but again you need money to eat right. I do walk 8000 to 10000 steps a day but it hasn't done anything for my body. I've had a good life though. I opened a successful boutique which then went under due to long term street construction. I did well as a model and even as a vet assistant. I play violin and draw better than average but not so well that I can make a career out of my talents--believe me, I've tried. I can't hold down a vanilla job and have been fired so many times due to my lack of people skills. I really have a hard time with authority figures and corporate politics. I just can't play the game to get ahead. I've had so many traumatic jobs where my boss would either verbally or sexually harass me, or sabotage and steal my work. I'm just tired and I feel guilty for living and making my husband support me. I never chose to be born and I have no idea why I was even brought into this world. I've always felt bewildered by human beings and life in general. I just want to leave my aging physical body and not have to worry about superficial material things anymore. I can't stand the fact that I have to tolerate a job to make money to live out my days aging. I've tried so many diets and body hacks to change my body. Nothing works. In fact, any real hardcore exercise makes me gain weight because my adrenals are so worn out. I went temporarily blind on a raw vegan diet. I don't know how some women can stay so beautiful and young looking. Their techniques just don't work on me. Part of me wants to fight this voice that lulls me into committing suicide. Part of me says there are ways to change my body and that God wouldn't give me this body to hate it. There is a way for me to make some kind of supportive income so I don't have to rely on my husband. Hope is so seductive. Maybe I can find a way to fix this life and somehow enjoy it again. Wouldn't that be nice? Thanks for reading this. I appreciate your time. I hope you're not considering ending your physical existence. There must be a reason we are encouraged to live our lives out as fully as we can, there must be a reason why suffering happens. The tiredness has to stop because I choose to make it go away. Life really is dictated by our thoughts. So the more I wallow in this misery the more I create it. That's how it works and it sucks because it's really easy for me to just surrender to the misery and live in the pit. It feels so familiar to be miserable because I could blame my father for beating me as a kid. I could give into the misery of surviving several sexual assaults when I was a little girl. No one would question why I decided to end my life. I won't kill myself today because I decided to hang on to the hope that I can change my body for the better and find a way to make a decent income. It's out of curiosity to see how my life will turn out. I can always kill myself if it gets really bad.

Fuck Everything.,"I have nothing left to look forward to and nothing to look up to. I can only possibly get 2 GCSE's, one of which I've given up on and the other's useless in life. I have no social life and can't handle people in the slightest. I just curl up on the bench at break with my coat protecting me from the outside world. I wasn't always this way. I've only realised this since March, when my mother committed suicide. The day my entire world came crushing down.I guess I'd better explain what this is about. I've always grown up in poverty. Not just ""We can't afford computers or consoles"" level of poverty, I mean scraping around underneath sofa cushions for 10p's to try and get some bread and milk.But I was happy. It taught me to appreciate what little I had and not to worry about what I didn't have. And that's how things were for the first 15 years of my life.In 2014, not long after we moved house, my mother became friends with a man from down the road and in the summer of last year he invited her out to play Pokemon Go. They admitted that they loved eachother, within a few months he'd moved in and in March they'd sent off marriage forms.So, my mother had a man who loves her, a nearly 18 year old daughter getting ready for uni, a 15 year old trying with his GCSE's, and a 13 year old figuring out what his options'll be. Surely this should be the most exciting time as a parent?Apparently not as on the 10th of March, the day after they sent off the marriage forms, Mum killed herself. She didn't leave a note and didn't say goodbye in any way. She just went out ""to the shop"" and never returned.At that point social were scrambling to figure out what to do with us and the rent situation. But it's alright, we have the fiance to look after us.Come mid April he's decided he doesn't care about us. And instead of giving us a warning, he just packs up and leaves. The first thing we knew about it was social calling my sister to let her know, that she wouldn't be able to look after my 13 year old brother and I and so we'd be put into a foster home. It took a month for us to be moved because my brother and I literally cannot share a room and we had to be near a train station so we could visit my older brother and sister.So I was forced to move 23 miles away to a town I'd never even heard of into a house with upper class cunts who think everyone should be exactly like them who make me pay for literally everything from clothes to the light bulb in my room to pens and pencils myself despite them not letting me look for even a summer job in a cornershop and to a school full of upper-middle class people who've OBVIOUSLY never had to go without anything and look down upon the poor. I had to try and explain to someone in my art class what hunger is and what it feels like!The biggest factors in my final decision are that people live like this while others like my mother kill themselves or even starve to death in Britain because they're barely even earning a quarter of the poverty line,  and that is my future. That's what I have to look forward to.Here's why; I left school at 11 to start helping my mother more because of her depression making things hard for her but I just ended up not having the time for home-ed so I will have no qualifications. I can't be around people, I can't praise myself (so a CV's gonna be impossible) and I'm so fat amateur football clubs turn me down as a goalie despite being better than (or at the very least turning up more consistently than) their starting keeper. The lack of playing made me fatter and sadder because I started comfort eating and now I can't stop.And in the past few weeks I've noticed myself waking in the early hours of the morning with a notebook on my lap, a pen in my hand and another page of the thoughts I keep firmly locked inside my head for the most part, just sprawled across another page. Stuff like ""I am not me. It's all just other people's versions of me"", ""I have lost touch with who I really am"", ""How is life a gift? Answer me that, Christians"", ""People are dying of starvation in Britain while [foster carer's names] stuff their pockets"", ""People like me shouldn't exist"", ""These are the voices I live with 24/7/365! GET THE FUCK OUT OF ME PLEASE"" Ooh, a page here that just says ""FIX ME PLEASE!"", ""Please help me! Please I don't know what to do!"", half a page of ""The end is never the end is never the end is never the end"" just looping (which I swear I've heard somewhere before) followed by half a page of ""I'm scared"" over and over again, ""Don't come near me! I SAID STAY BACK! For your own good! Please help me, mummy"", ""Why am I this way?"" and ""I'll show you! I'll show you all!"" on the same page, and ""I'm not scared anymore. I'm ready for my final dance!"" and that's just the highlights. I swear to the-nonexistent-God I'm not making this up.The only thing that's held me here for so long is the thought of it being my brother to find me lifeless, but now I just don't care. And don't tell me I don't know what's right for me. I've still got about 50-60 years left if I don't end it and that's if I try everything (in vain) to fix my future. I don't want that long in the same poverty I've grown up in. Unlike my mother, I can't make �40 last a week. And I don't care how selfish suicide is. I am selfish.Thanks for reading, even though I know you're rolling your eyes at the thought of yet another depressed teen on here.",A2,0.85,"The text reflects significant emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal, compounded by a history of poverty and recent traumatic events.

I've made 4 attempts this year.And yet, nobody seems to get it.Last Thursday, my parents picked me up from my appointment and had brought my brother along. They'd gone out to eat while they were waiting, and no mention of lunch was made. We basically didn't have anything at home to eat, so I skipped lunch.It's not unusual for me to skip meals, but this time, I went completely off the rails. I took a shower, then, thinking my parents had gone out, went to their room. Why? To get the medications that it's possible to reliably lethally overdose on. They were there, but I played it off as nothing.I can't afford to be hospitalized. If I don't succeed in killing myself, I'll end up having to withdraw from my classes and lose financial aid. I don't have any other source of income, and I need that money if I plan on living.I met up with one of my few friends the day before yesterday (after 6 months of not talking). I've been talking regularly to another. I haven't discussed this with them, except when one of them found me talking about it through a semi-anonymous account and brought it up.

On my way down to London for what could be my biggest career developing opportunity and having written a suicide note a matter of days ago I'm at my absolute lowest.,"Hey,So I've been pretty low this year and it appears to be getting worse. I've never struggled with feelings like this until this year - in fact I've been fortunate enough to be an incredibly happy person - but due to many issues in every area of my life all happening at once, I think about how low I am and how I can 'get out of it' very often.A few days back I started writing a suicide note for my sister. She doesn't know what I've been going through and I began to explain the terrible year I've had. Then I got to the point where I was telling her why I was leaving this note for her and not my mother or any of my friends. I believed she'd find it in her to understand and forgive me more than anyone else. I just kept writing and writing until I had a dissertation sized note and I broke down, cried, then stopped writing. I had no plan of how I was going to end it but I hoped I'd have it in me to finish the note and go and do it one way or another.Right now, I'm on the train down to London for a week of writing sessions. I'm a songwriter/producer for a living and will be in the room with many high profile writers, some of which have written for the likes of Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, John Newman, Kylie Minogue etc etc. Not that these names matter, but I want to emphasise how I'm really not in the right headspace for this and I feel so fragile and inferior right now. It's a feeling I've become familiar with this year but I just have no idea how this is going to go when suicide is so frequently on my mind. Stress of this level is not what I feel like I need right now but I can't get out of it.I don't know what I'm expecting by writing this on here, but I felt like I needed to do it.Thanks for reading.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates active suicidal ideation, including writing a self-harm note and contemplating methods, which signifies a crisis level of urgency.

I think my friend killed herself.,"I'm in vacation right now, my third day here. My friend always told me, since I mentioned the trip, that I shouldn't go (jokingly, or at least I thought). I found out yesterday, as she told me, that she didn't eat all day and cut herself. She was now at the hospital, and I wasn't that worried because it seemed like she was going to be fine. I couldn't sleep last night so I've been sending her many messages hopping she'll react with a smile as she wakes up, but I'm afraid she won't. One of the last things she told me is that they gave her something (the doctors) and she was feeling dizzy. I feel like just maybe, that wasn't a good sign. I never cry (because I can't) but I now am tearing up, a little. I hope that she's actually just sleeping but I have no idea, and that is killing me.I am honestly thinking of killing myself if she does it ��� what's the point.

I don't know if I can do it anymore,"I left the military a couple years ago after no longer being able to with cope PTSD and back to back deployments. I'd started school and my wife began a new career and life seemed ok. Almost out of nowhere my sister's kids get taken away by child services and my family begs my wife and I to take custody of the three young children (all under 3) so that my sister may be able to have visitation ( as opposed to what a foster parent might allow). There's tons of fear and trepidation surrounding the notion but we agree to it.
After a couple months of almost no sleep and grades slipping I vent to family members who call me selfish for complaining and not considering the situation the babies and my sister are in. Decide to press on  and sister visits her kids daily but she grows increasingly passive aggressive and treats us like servants and throws fits if we don't raise her kids the way she prefers. Many arguments ensue and we attempt to reconcile and come to a happy solution but sister is never happy and always starts a fight.
Fast forward a couple years and kids are still here with no idea when sister will regain custody. I've graduated school but cant fight a decent paying job due to hours ( cant find/afford anyone to watch the kids during after preschool hours). Now we're behind on bills and sister is being taken to court for child support (not by my request) by the state and she grows madder and more abusive to me by the moment. She's always shown clear signs of antisocial personality disorder and/or narcissism. She's threatening to blame me for fraud (idk how) and accuses me of hurting her kids every time they end up with bruises from fighting one another. She has zero grounds for it or little proof but I know the allegation alone could ruin me. I've been suicidal on and off but I'm really at my wits end. The only solution of getting her off my back is to give custody to child services/foster care but the breaks my heart tremendously to give up the kids, regardless of how hard it's been, since I've had them since infancy. It's making me tear up as I type this. I wanna live but I cant see life getting any brighter. Broke, homeless or in jail are not how I intended for things to be by helping out my family.

End of my rope,"I lost my dream job in 2009. I havent been the same since. Ever since then, things have been going downhill. My wife and I stopped being intimate. We basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates. She makes more money than I do now and she takes care of 90% of the household expenses. The small amount of money I do bring in goes towards my debts. I have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago. I dont know why, but I just cannot do it. Adding to that, my health has gotten worse since then. I refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist. I just cant bring myself to do it. Instead, I drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest. I am now at the point where if I dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself, I wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself. Problem is, I am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that I cant see past that. It occupies my every thought. My wife is an incredible woman. She accepts my faults (most of them) and is incredibly patient. I am failing her. I have failed her in the past and if I am around for more years, I will continue to fail her. And fail myself. I can no longer accept this. I just turned 40. I dont want to turn 41. On my 40th birthday, spending time with my parents and wife, I looked out over the city and decided that Tuesday was the day that I needed to let them all move on. Now it is Friday and I dont feel any different. Family have gone home. Wife has a bright future. I feel like I am just a roadblock to prosperity. I remember when I was 19 and I was convinced that I would die before I was 21. I lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then. In fact, I should have died a number of times. Somehow, I survived and prospered. Then things went off the rails again. I guess this is what happens. And at the end of the day, I think Tuesday was always the logical conclusion.

It's morning.,"I just wanted to rant for a momentI want really badly to be more suicidal than I am... I feel very overwhelmed in the sense that I feel this badly/don't feel like I have anyone to talk to, to the point where I would post here, but I still don't think I have merited it. I don't feel like I deserve an outlet. Social media isn't fun for me anymore because its just anxiety inducing. I don't talk to my friends-- friends I have never bothered to hang out with because I am afraid. I am never comfortable. I'm not comfortable outside my house, but when you get down to it, how much potential do I have to feel secure if I am scared and overwhelmed lying in bed, with McDonald's hashbrowns en route.I feel disgusting! Its been a kind of crescendoing feeling that now feels like a shrieking sadness. I despise even the way I articulate and speak and write because it feels wrong... Either in the sense that it feels disingenuous, or that its too raw, too eager, in a cringey, pathetic kind of way. I haven't made any progress in therapy, but its my fault! I don't have anyone to talk to about being depressed or anxious because its so steeped in self loathing and suicidal thoughts, and that scares my parents! It makes people angry because they don't understand how I could hate myself, but its so deeply ingrained in everything I do. I'm not good enough, I'm too much. I'm pathetic and avoiding. I am not the adult I should be.....not the person I should be. I hate feeling revolting, but more than that I hate the way this repels people. I can't validate myself...... But complements/reassurance from others means nothing to me. I'm too anxious to call my therapist. I'm tempted to email, but I'm so disgusted with myself for being weak and pathetic.Being depressed I can talk about... Anxiety is hard, because its harder to pin down why I feel the way I do. Self loathing is just a no go, for me, because its like a knife... people don't understand.Sorry for being morose... I feel like when I let things boil over, venting does more harm than good...

"I [23 F] am struggling with suicidal thoughts again and, though I don't believe that I would go through with it, it's difficult to wake up every morning.","For a bit of background, a lot has happened to me recently and this isn't the first time I've felt suicidal. I've been quite depressed for the past year and a half- at one point, around 6 months ago, I started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though I suspect it was mostly cathartic. I'm not sure. I will also note that three years ago I had a drug overdose that I believe was a suicide attempt, but I am not quite sure. I was sort of in auto-pilot that day. At the moment, I'm finishing my degree, moving out, am seeing a psychiatric who believes I have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and self-hate. I'm crying almost every day. I truly believe that the people around me are sick of me and/or hate me but feel obliged to stick around. The heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end. For instance, around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends, but I had a prior commitment. He said he had decided to go later and I said 'I might come too then' and he ignored the statement and planned around me. I literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me because I'm probably a buzzkill or he's tired of me, and he probably doesn't care at all if he didn't even try to give an excuse or anything. This is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of self-esteem.I don't want to be around myself either but I don't have a choice. I'm scared of finishing my degree because I think I might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamed. I'm scared of staying with my aunt if I don't find a new place to live soon enough, and my lease is up in two weeks. I'm scared of getting diagnosed with bipolar. I'm scared of losing everyone in my life. I'm just so tired and I want to sleep all of the time, I don't have the capability to get through the next month.

I will be positively  if I go back to that fear of just walking to the bathroom, of literally living in the attic and being side-eyed for breathing. I've only told three people what they did to us, so if anything, getting it out is cathartic. Catharsis, however, does nothing to help what extends past emotion, though I wish someone would hold me for just a moment. I literally cannot exist. Don't have the papers. Don't have the papers to get the papers. Things wouldn't improve if I just packed myself across the country and stayed with friends that only half know me, nor would they really improve if I had the money to fill my college seat fee. That one was a real eye opener-- spending years clinging to the notion that college would save me, no matter the debt or trials, only to have what hope that proffered stripped. I swore I would  it work, but here I am, drowning in unmarked, unexpected territory. Such is life.My parents would separate if it weren't for the fact that we are dirt-poor and completely reliant on my now jobless step-father. My maternal family is somewhat excommunicated, and they're hardly any better off than we are. They're rotting in their town, just as we are in this wasteland. My mother and I joke bitterly that we've got some multi-generational curse-- maybe that's just the curse of poverty and abuse cycles? Speaking of, the day we found out  may come our way, my parents got smashed, as per usual, and fought. Fifth or so time now within the past year that my step-father has stormed off in the night. Twice that we know he attempted to leave us and later shove in our faces how easy it was. Three days in and they haven't said a word to one another. He's gone all day, supposedly at his parents' place, but we have suspicions that align with missing chunks of money. No one seems to understand the gravity of my situation, though my interaction is increasingly limited after a long period phoneless, internetless, and barely eating. ( We moved across the country when this all started-- we used to move pretty frequently, but it's been three years. I was homeschooled during that time and never allowed to leave our apartment.) No single thing can be remedied without tracing back to the roots of others, hence why I've only ever turned in full bearing to Reddit, with it having at least a grain more anonymity while unfurling my life story than turning to acquaintances, of course. It lets me still keep that whole gdforsaken cordial distance with them; what few, positive interactions I have since I don't want to burden them with this. They may get bits and pieces because I'm not one to lie, but...I can't tell them this. It's too much, they shouldn't have to even shoulder that burden briefly. I'm done. Very done. I've got my cat and my little brother, but my friends are busy and haven't seen me in years (if at all) and my mother is...complicated. She poured out all of her disappointments in me recently; my religion, my school (despite having an offer and a huge scholarship thanks to years plastering myself to good grades), my existence...I feel so lost. I'm not allowed outside-- haven't been since moving here a few years ago-- and can't even afford myself a breath of fresh air. I don't see the point anymore. Things will  be getting better because legally, there's nothing for me to do. There's nothing I can take into my own hands, no simple mentality change. I'm thoroughly fucked at the most crucial point in my life, and I feel hollow. Alone. Frightened.

"I've Had A Death Wish For A While Now, And It's Just Gotten Worse.","I actually don't know why I'm telling anyone about this. Ever since my first depression scare back in seventh grade, I've always thought I was getting better. The feelings kinda faded out, and I generally internalised any desire to kill myself. I think that's because my mother started calling it emotional blackmail after about 3 months. She tends to put me down a lot. The thing is, no matter how much we argue, no matter how little self-worth she makes me feel, I still love her, and she loves me. My death wish was just general, hoping for a truck to hit me, or a random heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. I wouldn't want to kill my self at all, I had a lot of hope, but I wouldn't have minded dying. I always lied on those depression questionnaires at the doctor's office, I had a feeling my mother would yell at me. But recently my life hasn't been going so perfectly. In certain areas, I'm fuckin golden, life is great, I'm actually on track for debate team leadership and I'm enjoying school somehow. But everywhere else just hurts. I've gotten worse at swimming after taking a month off, my grades are slipping in a few classes thanks to teachers who give about three assignments a month, and on good days I talk to people outside of my family circle. On bad day's I just get reprimanded for not being a top performer, and not being like the rest of the Indian community. I hold my fingers up to my head and pretend it's a gun a lot. Try to fantasize about what it would feel like. I do it a lot around my mom. I just pretend I'm scratching an itch, she hasn't really commented on it. Frankly, I have conversations with myself inside my head when I'm swimming, or when I'm lonely; it tends to make me feel a bit better. Other times it makes me feel worse. I don't do anything to get more friends, or even to keep them, just because I fucked up back in seventh grade making me worry that doing anything would make it worse. Yesterday, I wanted to skip swimming, and then my mom told me that some friends of mine were ditching to go for a football game. She offered to take me, but I decided to go to swimming instead, mainly because that wouldn't involve as much interacting with people. I wanted to become a comedian, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I also wanted to be a neurologist or neurosurgeon, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I've actually thought of how WWIII would give me a chance to enlist and die fighting, making me a little bit more useful. Then I realised I'm clearly insane to even imagine that. I don't know how to end this. The post or my life, it's not like I have a gun or anything. I've heard that bleach often fails, and I don't want to risk that. So basically, my only effective method is jumping off the roof of my school or some other tall-ish building.

Unemployment Blues: why don't I feel like doing much to help myself??,"I lost my job in July (bit of a blessing in disguise there, as it was as a cashier at Walmart, a shit place to work if ever there was one) and have been unemployed since.  They fought my unemployment money so that never arrived after I applied.  Just fucking hate them; I'm disabled with CP and Walmart as a rule seems not to give a shit about ADA, they fought (and thankfully lost) against each of my ""reasonable"" accommodations and in general were indifferent and uncaring to my physical and mental suffering at their hands.But enough about all that, thinking about them at all just infuriates me more.  I'm 26 and without a job.  Fortunately I had built up a bit of a financial cushion so I'm not entirely in dire straits yet.  Thing is, I've dealt with pretty severe clinical depression for most of my life and even attempted suicide in March (after my managers threatened to fire me after I was scammed several hundred dollars in prepaid cards by a group of known criminals).So here I am, two months out and losing hope of finding full-time employment quickly enough that my current cash doesn't run out.  I cannot stand for long, so that rules out most fast food places...not that I'd want to lower myself to that--I have a four-year English BA, for god's sake!!  My options, with no real experience in my chosen field, are unfortunately quite slim.I'm just getting tired again and apathetic about continuing to search for anything meaningful out there on the Internet job boards.  I'm on a new antidepressant (again)  and it's actually working most of the time; it takes the edge off, at least.  It would buoy me up to a level plateau (AKA, ""normal""), whereas before, I was mostly in the deep dark pit and it was an effort to even rise to that ""normal"" level, to say nothing of anything about it.So, I'm just getting worn out yet again.  I know I NEED to be really looking for a job...but I just can't muster the willpower.

Feel like my life is pointless.,"Recently I've been feeling like I'm useless for many reasons,
I am a 18 Year old currently in the uk and I've made many wrong choices in the world for example gone down the wrong side career path which is now too long late to change, which I am not going to get anywhere in.
Feel as so I will never get a job that keeps me with a roof over my head, food and things that I wish to have.
I am over weight and find it really hard to lose weight, I've been trying for over 5 years.
I've got no friends.
No one ever speaks to me, only with small talk or one word.
I get ignored by lots of people.
When walking passed people around college, even people who I never met before, they all say nasty things or take the mick, which I don't know why because I have done anything.
Even one of my tutors wasn't really friendly whom I had last year as she always picked on me and never believed what I said.
I've never had a girlfriend, I've felt like I have fallen in love once before when I was 15 and i thought she felt the same about me due to the way she acted and spoke, when I told her how I felt about her she never spoke to me again and got a group of people who threaten me as it turned out she was just using me.
However this last year I have found someone new, which I have feelings like I've never felt before but she seems to good for me as I'm scared to tell her how I feel because of what happened last time and I know she will reject me as I'm not perfect at all but I also feel as if I find someone I truly like it will change my life completely.
Im completely unattractive
My anxiety makes everything worse what I do.
I am a very shy person.
My life goes down hill each and everyday, things becoming more worse for me then ever
People look down at me as if I'm _�թ
They are many other reasons wh�� I'm feeling down.
I know some of you will probably laugh at me because I'm pathetic, but this is how I feel but I'm scared of dying.
The only people who seem to care about me is probably my family.",A2,0.85,"The individual expresses persistent feelings of worthlessness, social isolation, and struggles with self-esteem, which indicate a need for intervention.

Death sounds pretty nice to me 25M,"Suicide or rather death is nice dream to me, I guess since I grew up going to a christian school the whole notion of ���dust to dust ashes to ashes�۝ seems like somewhat of a cathartic experience, ya know full circle type of shit.  I can�۪t say I�۪ve lived a hard or troubled life, I never went without or experienced struggle the likes that a great majority have.  I went to a good school got good grades had plenty of extracurriculars and got into a great college on scholarship which I proceeded to flunk out of because I never showed up to class.  The problem is or rather MY problem is that I�۪ve never given a shit about anything in life ever.  That last sentence isn�۪t entirely true I guess if I have to put it into words my life�۪s goal has never been to improve or change anything or anyone�۪s life, it�۪s been to be a net zero.  It was always easier to do well because no one would hassle me.  I like the easy way out even if it means a little bit of work(weird rationalization, I know).  I want to fade into nothingness.  I don�۪t want to be remembered, I don�۪t want any trace of my life to ever exist.  At this point in my life I�۪d rather be dead than to drag those around me down with my carefree wanton lifestyle because it�۪s probably depressing for others to watch my life implode by my own hand.  To those wondering about mental health shit, I�۪m not depressed, I kind of have an awesome life.  I do have schizophrenia or rather I was diagnosed with it though I haven�۪t taken medication in over 8 months as I�۪ve had no signs or inklings of it.  Schizophrenia was freaky at first and to be honest I flipped the fuck out straight 5150 status but once I understood what was going on in my head the shit was easy to rationalize, compartmentalize, and control.  Aside from some legal trouble i.e. alcohol related due to poor impulse control because yea I want to die, my life is pretty dope. Life seems like a colossal waste of time that only drudges on to make me feel even worse about the shit I�۪ve done, the people I�۪ve disappointed, and the relationships I�۪ve ruined via utter apathy.  Maybe this isn�۪t the right place to express my feelings but as much as I would love to commit suicide, it�۪s too much work for nothing.  I gain nothing by killing myself other than reliving the burden that being part of a society entails.  Call me greedy, selfish, short-sighted or whatever you want but life has no meaning to me aside from suffering.  We all will die someday unless there are cyborgs so what�۪s wrong with speeding the hands of Father Time up a bit.  I�۪m but one drop in the bucket out of over six billion, who cares, life is cruel sadistic joke, I guess the greeks had it right about Sisyphus.  I don�۪t know whether it�۪s right to continue living a tortured existence where I�۪m only bound to cause more long term hurt to those around me or in one swift action cause immediate pain that will subside over time.  I feel like a cancer to those around me.  I�۪m at an impasse somewhat wishing I was standing on an overpass except knowing my luck I�۪d land on a prius.",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2

My life is so diffifult and recently got 20 x worse
I came across this subreddit when I searched for suicide help/Hotlines etc I contacted 3 of them and WOW what I waste that is all saying the WRONG things and very generic , DO NOT say to a suicidal person anything about family from what would they think  or think about them ... Anything chances are the person A has no family or B ( me) had a horrible childhood where they were abused etc. point is the hotlines made me feel worse.
I could ramble on forever but no one likes a sob story
I went from a good job and decent life to losing nearly everything in not a long time span it's been a decline and got more and more depressed with each day, my main reason now is  am less than broke I have been through some real shit and do not want - no can not deal - going from a real apt to a shitier one and another and another to a shitty temp spot sometimes I don't eat
I bust my ass to help myself no am not improving  I have been paying for a weekly room which I am overdue on and I will be on the street tomorrow - in fkn NYC - the worst of the worst, If I don't do it myself someone will stab me on the subway at least.
Not to mention Dr's don't want to hear me out or help they don't care ( at least not in this city ) I have no religion o PLEASE do not come at me with that but that is it a not so young 30-something year old guy I see no other way out.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates active suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and a lack of support systems.

"I dont feel right, like im not a normal person","I came here because I feel like this is the only place that I can  talk to someone about this. I started dating this cashier at a store down the road from my house and fell in love with her, everything about her just seemed perfect and she told me she felt the same but about a month in she told me that she didn't feel ready for a relationship, like she couldn't put in the effort she felt that I deserved because she was dealing with alot at work and at home. She told me that she still loved me and still wanted to spend time with me when she could but didn't want a relationship until she felt her life was more stable but a month after we broke up she started dating this other guy and cut me off. This was around june-july when this happened and I'm still upset, I still think about it every day and I just don't feel like I should be this upset. A normal person wouldn't be this hurt over  a girl they only knew for a month or 2. And the fact that I am just makes me feel like I'm not meant to be here, like im not meant to find love and have a family  because I don't know how to just let go.

I'm Feeling Suicidal Again - I Really Need Advice,"For the past month I've been staying with my partner, and I just got back home today. We've been together for over two years now, and we're long distance. We visit each other three times a year or so but it never feels like enough.I've been struggling with chronic suicidality for almost as long as I've known my partner. When we're together I rarely even get depressed, but now I'm back home and I've been home for less than 12 hours and I feel suicidal again already. I spoke with my partner about moving in with him, but he's in the US and I'm in Canada, and the only way for us to legally move in with each other is for us to get married, which is something he says he's not comfortable with and he doesn't think he ever will be. He doesn't want to break up, and wants us to be together, but he says that maybe we might have to just be long distance because he doesn't think he'll ever be okay getting married. I don't want to get too into it, because I really feel like I need help quickly and don't feel like I have much time. I don't see a point in living if we're going to be apart like this forever. There's so much I'll miss out on, and I get so depressed being here. I don't see a way out. I feel very urgently like I want to kill myself. Please help me somehow.

I don't know who I am anymore,"That's where I'm at right now as I write this. I've been depressed for years now, but the depression this time is different, stronger. I don't really feel down, I just feel empty, drained of everything that was ever considered me. I rarely 'feel' anything anymore, or at least I no longer know how or what to feel. Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of. I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I'm obligated to. My personality is gone as well and the feelings I've had for those close to me are no longer there. When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing. I don't feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore. I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell. I mean, there are times when my legs or my hands don't feel like mine. My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day's past. Just typing this is an ordeal, constant spelling mistakes and typos.On top of all this, I have no one to talk to. I have no friends to talk to. Sure, my Facebook profile says otherwise, but I never talk to any of them online, let alone IRL. I can't even tell my family because I know all they'll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help. I mean, I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly, even with people I know quite well. I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis, but I've realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another, be it my personality and mannerisms, or just because they found something better. Some say a therapist or counselor might help, but they never have for me. The problem is myself. I'm physically repulsive. I've seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me. I mean, who wants to be seen talking to a fat, greasy, pizza faced, creeper-stache monster with a sweat problem? Even if they can get past that outer shell, what they find isn't any better. I'm a dull person. The things that interest me typically don't interest others and vice versa. My personality and interests just aren't compatible with most people. And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid, or something about me drives them away.And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience. Maybe not so much a burden, but just one of those people where others go, ""Oh, here comes THAT guy again. Quick, let's think of a reason not to hang out with him."" FFS, I even feel this way with complete strangers. When I'm crossing the road, buying groceries, riding the bus, or just simply standing around. I just get this sense that people wish I weren't there. That if I weren't, their day would be 100% better.I'm also an addict, or rather becoming one. For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos, anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain. Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile. Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking. I managed to kick those for a few months, but now I'm back at it. Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo. Anyways I feel like I'm rambling a bit. I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I'm planning on doing, it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to. I want the old me back, the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until 5am to figure out a bug in some code. And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel. Because I don't have someone to talk to, I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so. Some might say get a therapist, but I've tried in the past and it just doesn't feel genuine enough. I need a friend, not a therapist. Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school, but again, I feel like I'm such an inconvenience to them. Anyways, come Wednesday night (I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday, some final preparations) I'll finally be done with this. It's not that I'm in any sort of emotional or psychological pain, it's just that I'm tired of not feeling, tired of feeling like an empty shell. Unless a miracle happens between now and then, there's no stopping me now. I've gathered my materials and made my preparations. I'm just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest.",A2,0.85,"The text describes prolonged depression, emotional numbness, lack of motivation, cognitive difficulties, and social isolation, which indicate a need for intervention but do not suggest immediate danger or crisis-level urgency.",False,,,A2
I can't stop thinking that suicide may be the best option.,"I'm 32, I was born with cerebral palsy. All my adult life I heard from people how cushy it must be to live off their taxes because I got disability.In 2009 I enrolled in college and earned an Associate's in medical billing. I graduated in 2013 and stayed on to earn a Bachelor's in Management which I earned this year.At the time I was making $675 a month disability but was able to live because of my best friend and roomie who helps me with bills.In 2014 I took on a job and alerted social security, I was told I had 3 years I could work. I was never told I needed to show them my paystubs, I gladly worked and attended class feeling happy to be working, to be in class. I'd show the people who called me a leech that I could be more, I'd get off disability for myself.It's 2017, I've graduated, can find no work and have now been told by Social Security that I owe them $26,000 in over payment because I was never supposed to get payments from 2014 onward.They had my employer send them a 3 year print out of all my earnings, when I called them to ask why I owed and why, if they needed me to turn in my paystubs they never told me, they replied, ""we don't have to tell you, you were supposed to know.""I called them today to plead my case, that with rent, student loans, etc, I only have around $100 a month left, and that I barely make over $1,000 a month since my benefits stopped.I was told that I should send them, ""at least $100 a month, more if you can, even then it will take you 21 years to pay us back, you want to get this done sooner if you can.""I feel so fucking hopeless. All I wanted to do was have a better life, an education.

My husband and i got into a huge fight, he kicked me out as usual, wouldnt let me come home and i slept in my sisters car, this was all friday night by the way. He was wasted. Saturday morning comes, he texts me, you can come home the door is unlocked now. I walk in, and my son is still asleep but my 3 year old comes skipping on up to me. Im obviously happy to see her. I reach down to pick her up and she smiles this big beautiful smile. Then says, youre not my best friend. I died inside immediately. Throughout the day her phrases just got better. I cried all night saturday and most of today. She said daddy doesnt love you and this isnt your house. I have not felt this empty in years and i was hoping i would never have to feel this bad again. He has barely said 2 words to me, acts like nothing ever happened. So sorry for the long rant. But getting it out helps alot.

The rules state that I shouldn't ask for suggestion.I just want tell my story ,put it out here what I've been feeling for years.)I would like to clarify at the outset that  I'm not writing this  out of impulse now. I've been planning my suicide for more than  a year now.I'm 23 now, since I was 11/12 I've always felt I'm a misfit. I've always felt that I'm floating inside my body, I've no purpose in this world. I'm a loser, an evil incarnate, I can never be normal. I realized all this when I was 14/15.Throughout my school and college years ,I've been faking everything-smile,friendship,happiness,etc., Others don't know the face underneath the mask I put on. I've had it enough, I couldn't do the same at work,one day I just came to home without informing anyone at work.And when they tried to contact me ,I avoided itI was terminated. I lied to my friends that I got job in another city.For the past 18 months,I have been lying to them,while planning my suicide. I got hold of sleeping pills.I just want to end it and cause minimal harm to my family. I don't want them to find my body because this is just traumatic , hell it would be great if they didn't even know I was dead and just went missing.I always imagined I would get to a place like those deserts in Breaking bad  TV series and commit suicide. sometime I wish  someone would just kill me and dump in a place like that.alas, I live in third world country, I don't know if there are any such places here. I'm saying all this so that you  would understand where I am coming from and the  suicidal thoughts I have been having since childhood feeling  like a waste of space.So PLEASE don't try to convince me not to, I've heard it all before and it wont help. hell its probably just like what it was like before I was born - nothing - and compared to the pathetic life I live that sounds great to me.please help me.PM me your ideas.Help this world by getting ridding of me.

The one person who's supposed to love me for me and I'm fucking destroying his life.

My life ought to be good.,"Forgive my rambling.My name is Ethan. I'm a 17 year old high school senior. I'm told I'm smart and attractive. My parents are married and have money, and I live in the ""free-est"" country on earth. I'm popular at school, within the right circles. I'm the drum major of the marching band. A member of every honor society, a straight A student, and enrolled in college as a high school senior because my school ran out of classes to give me. I spend 2 hours every Monday volunteering at the local co-op, and use my position on the local city's student government to learn about and connect with people in need, and spend many, many hours at school after hours doing tutoring and mentoring. I have a relatively well-paying job, too; $10 an hour, doing vet tech work at an animal hospital.But it's not enough, and will never be enough. Not for my teachers, not for my parents, not for my friends. I am overcommitted, to say the least; it's 1:00 AM, and I've got an AP Stat test in 6 hours that I haven't studied for nearly enough. My college class overlaps the period almost entirely, so I'm only in class for the first half an hour of the 90 minute block. My school advisors and counselors told me not to take the class, and now are telling me to drop it, but my mother won't have it. My schedule is ""not rigorous enough without it"". Forget my 8-credit surplus above graduation requirements and total 13 AP credits I'll have if I make it through the year, plus the 6 extracurriculars and 4 community organizations I either lead or am an active member of-- I need the Stat class, on top of AP Gov/Macro/Micro and AP Physics C:Emag, Linear Alg & Multivar calc, all of which have at least 2 hours homework on top of required textbook reading... It's wearing me down, driving me insane. On days like today, I turn up the good vibes music and try to forget, just to put one foot in front of the other. Just to churn through what needs to happen.I'm miserable, and losing sight of what matters. My ex, my one and only real girlfriend, and I had a nasty breakup in late May. It was really rough on me, but I thought I could make it out with my head held high. I've struck out 4 times since then. They always seem so eager, and then when they really get to know me they back off. It's hard not to take it personally. Sure, maybe we two just weren't compatible, but over and over? And with people I had spent plenty of time getting to know first. It's like people are fine with the mask I wear, but when I let my guard down and start talking about my demons, they excuse themselves.And I'm not even really that fucked up, as far as demons go. Just a crippling caffeine and video game addiction; I take a 200mg caffeine pill in the morning when I wake up, with lunch, and before I sit down to do homework. But I struggle to get motivated, even with the caffeine. It's so easy to come home and sit down at the desk to work, but see the battle.net launcher or steam pop up and tempt me with Overwatch, Terraria, or Stardew, my current weaknesses. I've put an embarrassing amount of time into my games, and don't feel proud at all of my ""achievements"". The friends I used to play them with have since moved on, and I let them. It's not even just an accessibility thing; if I disable my internet, just a pen, paper, and textbook, I still end up passed out on the floor from exhaustion or staring off into space, wishing I was anywhere else.I get that feeling a lot now. Marching band was fun in the beginning; now it's a slog, and I hate it. I hate the idea of dragging my two-hundred-pound podium up to the field, running back for my gear, and despite doing my very best still being at least 15 minutes late to rehearsal. Today, I was almost 45. As drum major, I'm setting a bad example for the kids I'm supposed to lead. I tell them to practice, and then go home and leave my instrument and gloves untouched. Half of it's that I've got so much other shit to do, and the other half is that I just don't care. I don't care if I'm bad anymore. I've already resigned myself to failure no matter how hard I try. I'm just not good. My instructor has said as much many times. Staring in the mirror knowing you'll never be capable no matter how hard you try fucks you up. Especially when to practice you have to check your reflection to see if your arms are parallel. I see the apathy in my own eyes, and... well, I don't care. I'm miserable, and can't escape for very long. Even the best performances are brought down when I watch the recording and see how bad I look. Friday nights, once my escape from the weekly slog, are now just another formula. I conduct, I rest, I play, I conduct, I rest, I conduct... wash rinse repeat. And it's starting to show. People come and ask if I'm okay. I don't know what to tell them.""I'm alright."" ""I'm fine."" Relatively, I can justify this. I've felt this way for a few months now. It feels normal... and yet, I remember  feeling like this. I remember what it feels like to love myself, and love others... to feel loved. But I exacerbated the situation by isolating myself from all my friends, local and online. I haven't been on Overwatch for real in... fuck, ages. A guilty solo queue game here and there, but not much else. I stopped eating lunch with my friends, preferring to work through lunch on homework so I have less when I get home. I don't have time to hang out on weekends, because I'm either doing school, band, or working. I feel so alone, even in a room of people. I spend so much time alone. And yet, I want to be alone. When I'm with others, I'm reminded of who I'm not. I'm not the Ethan I wish I was, the Ethan I am on the outside. I've spent enough time on this sub and ; I know people will tell me that they're both parts of the whole. Bull shit. Outside Ethan is a carefully constructed lie. The sociopath brewing inside of me recognizes that I'll be socially handicapped if I present anything else, and so I've learned to smile from the eyes despite feeling empty and cold.I also lost religion a couple years ago. I was raised Catholic; my family has drifted toward the megachurch style of christianity, due to both convenience and a slight shift of ideals. Leading up to the transition, I began to question the things I was brought up to believe. When and how did all these miracles happen? Why don't we see miracles today? It seems like they just popped up all the time back then. And how come people back then heard the literal word of god and saw angels and shit, and now all we have is a cobbled-together repeatedly retranslated dusty old book? My arguments to both myself and others have become more sophisticated over time, but suffice it to say-- today I am an atheist, and nobody I've met can convince me otherwise. But I wish so hard that I was a christian. I wish it was easy, that I could give my trust to an all seeing, all caring, all powerful god. I wish I could feel the unconditional love paraded by Jesus's followers. But I can't. I've tried so hard. My personal 'faith' is unshakable, and weighs down on me constantly. I need proof, and I cannot find it anywhere. The thought that life only has the meaning we give it once gave me agency and purpose, and now it fills me with despair. Why do I matter? Why should I try? I am a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.My grades suck. Mostly because they're indicative of just how many shits I give. I have a 117 in physics. The class average is somewhere around an 75, according to my teacher. Feels kinda good, right? I also have a 56 in English, because I haven't turned in half my work. Ah well. I keep telling myself I'll get around to it when I have time, but I don't. I'm told to excel in every way, and I can't. I'm sacrificing sleep to keep this clusterfuck of a life going. I don't eat enough. I'm 6 feet tall and 135 pounds, all muscle and bone. I'm just not hungry. I want to eat, and I try, I just don't have an appetite. My hands shake constantly because I'm fueled by caffeine and caffeine alone for most of the day. My body is always tired but I force it to keep going, and I'm starting to question why.Why do I bother waking up in the morning? My body isn't getting enough sleep. My mind is cloudy from deprivation. But I know if I don't wake up by 5:40, I'll incur the wrath of my parents for not getting my little brother to school in time. I've always struggled to get to school on time, but this year it actually has consequences for someone other than me. I have school from 7 to 2, band until 6 twice a week, after school activities from 5-8 the other two days, and then I'm busy pretty much all of Friday nights. There's just not enough time in the day for it all. I'm overwhelmed, alone, and feel like while everyone in my life has the best intentions they're tearing me apart. I'm pulled in all different directions, and just want to rest. Man, I just want to take a break. I need to take some time to breath. I can't, though. The last time I did, I accumulated so much undone school work that I'm  allocating time to work on NTI's.I've got the constant weight of personal failure on my back at all times. I've failed myself, my parents, my band, my city, my friends... My parents need a good student, who spends time with the family and contributes to making sure things run smoothly. My band needs a drum major who works hard on and off the field, who comes to practice with a smile on his face and inspires his band to work with the same passion. My city needs a punctual ambassador, who doesn't forget to pick up his goddamn suit on the way home from rehearsal. My friends need someone who can be there for them like they're there for me, who makes time. I'm not that person. I need me to be that person. I need me to be someone I can love. I need me to stop smiling because I have to or my friends won't leave me alone. I need me to stop being a person who lets down and brings down.I hurt myself for the first time the other day. Just to see if I could. And I can. It's empowering. And scary. I'm more scared than ever. I now know I could do it. I'm so scared that one day a straw will break this camel's back and I'll give in to temptation. I've fantasized about it so many times. I am losing hope that there's anything worth living for. I'm starting to feel like a burden on my community, like they'd be better off without me holding them back. I know my death would hurt, but surely not so bad they'd never recover. My parents have 3 other kids that will go on to be even more successful than me. I've already distanced myself emotionally from them, and was never really close with my siblings like they are with each other. I've slowly let snapchat streaks die, and high fives in the hall become nods. Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder if I'd be like a dead cat. Mine died a few years ago; this tremendously fat white and black thing, so loving it broke my heart when he died. Every time I walked in the door and he wasn't there, I'd break into tears. Eventually I got used to sleeping alone, and the pain gradually dulled until I felt more of, ""huh. He used to sleep there. Weird not to see him like always."" I wonder if I'd be like that. That itch in the back of your mind like you feel something's missing, but you can't quite place it so you let it be. An empty seat in a classroom that might have always been empty. A position easily filled by someone just as qualified. A son already enough of a disappointment that you begin to feel grateful you don't have to yell at him to get out of bed, that he's late for school again. You have one less mouth to feed, and one less set of grades to check.I'm so scared of what's next. But I know it would stop the hurting. Even if it's nothing, it's still the bliss I want. I don't want any part of the life I'm living now. I'm like a spectator, a fly on the wall, watching it happen around me. I'm tired of the emptiness, and the pain, and the tears, and the regret. I'm tired of letting down, holding back, inconveniencing. I'm tired of letting myself down. I'm tired of failing. It's too much. And I can't give any of it up. If I do, it's not enough. It's not enough now. It will never be enough. All I can do is everything and then some. But I can't.My life ought to be good. So many stories here are much, much darker than mine. But I still don't see any hope for myself. I literally cannot imagine a future, any one at all, fantasy or otherwise, where I'm happy. I'm not motivated to keep going. I can't justify it any more. I'm miserable, and this ought to be as good as it gets. I have everything. And I have nothing.

It would mean a lot if someone saw this. I don't know what to do anymore,I hope someone reads this. I thought I was getting better over the summer. I don't know what happened. I'm a gay male. I went to a school that accepted me for who I am last year. I could finally express myself and be myself. It was the first time I've felt happy in years. Now I'm at a new school and I'm already being made fun of for being gay. A lot of the other guys in my school won't come near me. It's like I have some sort of disease. You know when something that shouldn't bother you anymore comes back up and just (metaphorically) punches you in the stomach. This has been going on for years now and in march it put me in the hospital for a month after I overdosed. I don't know what to do because everyone thinks I'm fine and I don't want to worry people but I stay up all night crying. And during the day I can't focus on anything. I don't know what to do anymore. What's making this worse is that I got kicked out of school because my grades were so low because I couldn't motivate myself to work hard. What got me through the day was being around my friends there and knowing that they truly cared about me but now I'm at a different school away from them. I've changed schools a lot but I went to one where I was being severely bullied one. Daily basis. Being beaten up by a group of kids almost on a daily basis. I ended up running away from the school one night and I slept in the woods. The police found me the next morning. But the school I'm at now is so similar to the school I was at where I was being bullied that it's giving me panic attacks cause I'm afraid it's gonna happen again. I keep thinking about trying to overdose again but the only thing keeping me from doing it is worrying that if I fuck it up I'll end up in the hospital and won't be allowed out for a long time. I've been in a psych ward twice. Once for attempting to jump off a bridge in fourth grade and then again this year.

Before I died I need to tell my story,"This is my life, It's a long sad story but one I must tell to someone. I was born a middle kid into a middle class family. My parents we're my first abusers. My Dad was an alcoholic. He beat me and my brother. Some nights were good and he just listen to music. My mom was not much better. She was abuse by my dad but she abuse him emotionally and financially. They were bad for each other.  Around the third grade I was diagnosed with autism. The testing was very traumatic. This was when I first experience gender dysphoria. In the waiting room the only VHS that worked was Alice in Wonderland. I wanted to be Alice. She could handle her new world and I couldn't handle mine. My parent just filled me with pills from than till high school. The pill made me slow and fat. It was easier to dope me up than to be a parent. This lead to me getting up to 400 LBS and I develop boob. (I'm a guy) I've spent my whole adult life trying to get fit because of this.

There's no proof left too, so one one would believe me. Collage was a failure to. I didn't know I had BPD and depression. I still didn't talk about being rape. I let it build up inside me.

I really don't want to live,"Let's start off by saying I'm a teenager. I've had moments of happiness, sadness, everything. Many times I felt suicidal, but today just takes the cake.
Recently I started high school. I had one friend in the class I was in, yet I decided to change the class so I could be with a ""friend"" that I was in class in middle school. Well, I changed the class, and he treats me like dust. Like I don't exist.  I can't believe this. I made my situation from bad to terrible. I had one friend to talk to - now I have literally none. All day in school, alone.
I don't think I'm able to change the class again, because you need a replacement person to take the place.
This really might seem like a minor thing, ""you'll make friends in the new class"", no I won't. It's full of scum and I have 4 years of this, everyday in front of me.
I left the school early because I wanted to cry and I wasn't able to sit there any longer.
I had a mental breakdown today and stood on the train tracks thinking if I should end it. I decided not.
Then I go back to my house, and it appears the teacher called my mom. There, I had an argument with her. I thought that it would get better. But it didn't.
It seems like no one cares about what I feel. I'm completely alone now and this really makes me want to put an end to this. In the end, we all will die, so it's basically like a shortcut.
I don't know. I really don't. It's such a simple thing to fix - just change my class back to the old one. But these pieces of shit teachers don't give a single fuck about it.

Honestly don't know how to cope with life anymore.,"I honestly never thought I'd be typing on this subreddit. The fact that I am, makes me feel even worse. I feel guilty because part of me loathes self-pity, but I am scared that one of these days, I might actually do something really dumb. That's why I'm here. This is my first post on this site. I literally made an account so I could talk to someone. To give a little bit of a backstory, because I didn't just wake up like this, will probably be helpful. I have a history with depression and anxiety. I have a history with abuse. Self-abuse/ self harm, abuse from others I've been romantically involved with, and sexual abuse from my childhood. Now on paper, or online, that all seems really dark, and it is, but it doesn't encompass who I am, and looking at me, you'd never be able to tell. I'm an above average attractive 24 year old woman. I have very strong metaphysical beliefs and I honestly believe in the good of mankind. I'm intelligent, I've had to fight to get where I am mentally and emotionally, to come off as really stable. I moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with $400 in my pocket and I made a life for myself here. I finally started living a life that I thought I deserved. A month ago, a girl I've been friends with said to me ""I honestly don't how you're so stable!"" and inside I chuckled to myself because she, like everyone else, only sees the surface. I'm what you'd call a ""functioning depressive"". To put things in perspective, if any of you have ever taken a meyers-briggs personality test, I'm an ENFP. Robin Williams was an ENFP. My number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because I never want to make anyone sad. I hate asking for help. I hate telling people I'm sad to guilt them into wanting to be around me. I know it's very self-destructive. I'm a very self-aware person. I was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because I barely felt like I could keep my head above water. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder. I scored very high on a dissociation test - I would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what I was doing two minutes later. I've almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well. It makes me seem very space-y and ditzy at times, when really I just go somewhere in my head without my permission because it's how I learned to cope with trauma as a child. My best friend tried to kill herself last December as well. She's my roommate, and I found her in the bathtub full of blood, and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before. December of '16 was my bottom. So, I started medication. To be honest, it really fucking helped. It got me out of my head enough to focus on my job. I got back together with someone who I was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability, and things were going great. I felt like November / December 2016 was my ""bottom"" - and I fought my way out and got to a stable place. Then May '17 happened. I started to wean back on my medication because I didn't feel like myself anymore. I was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood, and deal with that, but I didn't feel any emotions. I couldn't cry anymore. I would be in a room full of people, having an amazing time, and pretending I felt something. So I started to correctly wean off of my meds. I had been on them for less than a year, and I read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh side-effects. About a month after I completely quit, I felt back to ""me"" - without the up's and down's. I could paint again (I paint quite frequently, and the medication made me not want to do that anymore), I could cry, and most importantly I could feel things. But it got worse. I couldn't control my emotions anymore in a responsible way. I would lash out at the people I cared about. About what? I mean, 50% of it may have been legitimate things. Part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life OR people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are. 50% of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface. So I ruined a relationship with that guy. He won't speak to me anymore, which is fine, I don't think we were meant to be romantically anyways - but I apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything. I felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that I did. I have always tried to escape these issues through relationships. I have attachment issues. My love language is ""quality time"", so I tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a person I'm romantically involved with, with wanting to spend time with them, like all the time. Part of this is just how I bond, part of this is also escaping myself. I have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months. I don't know if he emphathetically understands these issues. Not that it's his responsibility to fully grasp them, but in this situation, I've tried to be very self-aware so I don't do those things (like lash out, etc). This person has been of great support to me. He has helped pull me out of neutral. I have started to find purpose in myself again, and a reason for being here. Today, I lashed out at him for something very trivial. We are not officially dating because we're millenials and it's only been a couple months, but I love his family, they love me, I love his dog, we spend a majority of our free time together, and I find that we really compliment each other in so many ways. I truly adore him. Of course there is a catch. When I met this person - he told me that he might be going to Europe for an extended period of time in the fall. So that's part of the reason we  to keep it casual, but it just ended up getting more serious, and eventually his ""me"" statements became ""we"" statements. I sometimes feel with this person I am on a rollercoaster. Once we started to get more serious, he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions. I respected that, but with all of my relationship insecurities, I saw it as a big red flag that he's just going to dip out come time. He's reassured me that he could never rid me of his life... but maybe that isn't good enough. I'm looking for something to give me purpose so I don't kill myself one day. I'm looking for it in the wrong places, and the wrong people, and I'm aware of that... but old habits die really hard. It's like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes, and from the theater you're yelling ""stop doing that!"" but they just keep doing it. Over and over again. Part of me thinks I should cut things off to save him from me. To save myself the inevitable heart break I will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for Europe without me. Part of me knows I lash out because yeah, I am insecure as f*** about where the relationship is going, but also because I have deep seated emotional fears. I fear that I will be forgotten. I fear that I will drive everyone away from me. I fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel, my destructive patterns will not let me see it, because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery. It has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind. Believe me when I say, if you met me, you'd think I was the queen of positivity. I want everyone to experience love and to feel loved. For some reason I won't allow that for myself and it kills me. Suicide at this point, albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons, seems less and less terrifying each and every day. The first time the thought crossed my mind, I was freaked out. Now, it's where my mind jumps to. The peace that I would feel, even for a millisecond, of not having to upset anyone anymore. I have a very loving and supportive family, but they don't know any of this. My best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in December, and I feel like if I bring anything up it's going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse. I bottle all of this up. I even asked the guy that I'm seeing to see him because I felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts... but he said that he thinks it's best if we both have space tonight because of how I lashed out at him earlier. So now I'm embarrassed. I feel guilty for even bringing that up to him. I feel like he doesn't care. Does anyone? I guess what I'm looking for is for a reason not to do it, eventually. I'm open to... anything really. I wouldn't be here posting this if I didn't feel so low. Maybe someone can also direct me to a sub-reddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma. I internalize everything. Everything ends up being my fault, even when it isn't, and it's a vicious cycle. I'm just hoping that before I choose to like, literally end my life, I keep going on the off chance that something good will happen. How I'm not seeing that, I don't get it.

I graduated high school and worked at a pizza place and made some close friends, especially with my shift leader who also would sell me marijuana, I would work off the clock for him to improve labor cost and in return he would give me a discount and or give me a free pitcher of beer. A few weeks later our manager found out somehow I was stealing alcohol and it turns out the same person giving it to me turned me in for it, it was my word over his and I didn�۪t want to make him to lose his job so I said nothing and quit. Arround the same time I was also going through a lot at home, my fathers an alcoholic and physically/ verbally abusive. My mother found out I was smoking marijuana and kicked me out.

Basically, I've been diagnosed with traits of BPD/HPD (not fully developed PDs), I display certain behaviours associated with those personality disorders and I feel like I'm a bad person that deserves to die. I want to gouge my eyes out, tear my body apart and run away from myself. I've been in therapy ever since I was 14 and I've still turned out fucked up, there are tiny improvements but overall, I feel I will never become a person that is worthy of having a happy life and being loved.

I have a volatile relationship with my parents, especially my mother, I'm a bad daughter and often I think it'd be better for them if I died or killed myself. I  to kill myself if I can't be a good daughter, a good person. I don't even  like a person, I don't feel like a human being and I haven't for a long time, I feel like it's not solid, material things building my body but my self-hate and fear and anger and envy. I'm not even sure I can love, maybe all I can feel when I 'love' is an egocentric, messed up, child-like dependency, maybe that's all I'm capable of. If that's the case, I absolutely do not deserve to have a family that loves me, I don't deserve a life.
I genuinely don't want to die, I don't want to not-exist, it's a scary thought, but I want to and deserve to kill myself.

Hopeless... (Long-ish post),"My life is falling apart, again. In the mater of a few weeks I will be homeless and I have no idea what to do. This isn't the first time this has almost happened. In fact, it is becoming more of my MO than anything: ""Find a place, things are fine for a few months, something goes wrong, I end up moving out/almost homeless."" I am so tired of this. Because of this cycle of instability, I am starting to develop signs of BPD which I never had before...or maybe I did but was undiagnosed and my life is just exacerbating the disorder to ungodly levels. Either way, this is hell and I don't want to do this anymore. Currently, I am staying with friends who were nice enough to put up with me for the last 7 months, but since I can't find work in this town due to being noticeably transgender (small christian right wing area in SoCal), and my depression issues are starting to affect the household, I have to move out. I have nowhere to go.Since my birthday is next month, I think I am going to go to Vegas, since I have never been there, and have one last hurrah. I am thinking I may even try hard drugs for the first and potentially last time in a seedy hotel room because I think that would be the most painless way to go...and I just cant do this anymore. I'm adult enough to see and admit when I have been bested...so here's me knocking down my king and calling the game -- what other option do I have? Keep trying? For what? The definition of insanity is trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. So again, I ask, for what purpose? To get even more rejection, more of being a coward that is afraid to live because I am a 6'2"" non-passing trans woman that people don't take seriously, more of asking the women in my life for help in the department of appearing more feminine and they all have better shit to do -- but will drop their life and jump at the chance to help a more passing and cute trans girl become all cute and pretty, more being othered and misgendered by people who in the same breath will tell me they love me and want the best for me, more moving from town to town trying to find my way only to get lost and fall down again, more trying to gauge social interactions and fumbling over my words and then no one wants to talk to me because I'm a weird freak, or constantly thinking I am a burden on everyone around me? Nah, I have had enough heartbreak and BS to last me a few lifetimes, and I am pretty certain I will not be missed. Sure, upon news of my passing people will likely go through the motions to seem socially acceptable to their peers -- and some may even cry, but they will get along fine, and in 6-8 weeks i will be a memory, and a year from now I may even become an anecdote to pepper conversations with, though I am doubtful of this. My own mother, brothers, stepdad, and anyone else that I once held dear before my transition won't even acknowledge my existence because I transitioned, and I now have no one. I try to make new friends but it is hard and this BPD makes the experience a complete nightmare, despite my best intentions. I just wish I knew what the fuck happened to me, fuck! I never wanted to be this person.Why am I like this...I don't remember saying ""I want to be a depressive wreck when I grow up,"" during career day in grade school. Fuck, why me?!I constantly feel like I am not good enough and like I am completely unloved. Worst of all, I feel like it is all my fault and I deserve all of this, I did it to myself - because I am weird and crazy. And I never wanted any of it...but that has been my life. Every time I try to insert some form of order and normalcy in my life, chaos rears its ugly head and throws everything on the floor. Each time I try to settle down and fight to find and maintain a job, start paying my bills on time and regularly, saving money, allowing myself to make plans for the future, and try to become a responsible person, the floor drops out and I am lampooned once again. This constant succession of falling down only leads me to start pondering things like, ""why even try?"", which, in the past I had answers for...but now,  not so much. The only person I have left to live for is myself and I am not selfish or a narcissist nor am I really worth much of an effort, so I am thinking that since no one cares about me -- including me, I will just fade away to nothingness and either die of an OD or get hooked on hard drugs -- either way it is a win for everyone else because they won't be bothered by me anymore. Maybe people will find out, maybe they won't, either way, I am just so tired of trying to save myself, and tired of asking for help in saving myself just to get ignored, passed over, or getting a good thing which I then end up completely fucking up. I know I have only been on reddit for a short while, but I have enjoyed it here and the people are nice. So, until we meet again when we are both cats...Thank you for listening, fellow redditors.

Then 6th grade came, I had missed the first the day because I had been away on holidays when I came back everything was awful I had a panic attacks and had to leave the classroom to be put into another room. I had to get help from every teacher that taught in 6th grade and a priest but nothing worked so I was put back into the class and told to ""jog on"" and was put on Prozac and entered therapy (still both being done today). Here I was diagnosed with depression and aniextyI went into 7th grade and left for boarding school and it was a woeful experience I was separated from my friends and everything was cold just cold is all I remember. I left the boarding school at Christmas and things seemed better 8th grade came and around September I had my first experience with suicide by cutting my wrists things got worse I gained weight,had no confidence and never left the house it was just awful and I tried to take my life many times by the end of 8th grade I will always remember sitting on the trainwith two guys that I didn't really now asking if I was going to a night out  and I just said no because I didn't have a ticket but the thing was I did but nobody wanted me. That summer I shaved my head for a charity and I went into another downward spiral I received abuse on the street and was all alone and suicidal not two things you want in your life By 9th grade I began to realise that it doesn't matter how high you are up in the social ladder but as long as you have friends it's ok so I went to a lower group. I began to go out with new people while in school I stuck with a new group of friends  and I went out more talked to girls everything I ever wanted and then got a girlfriend ....We had booted one guy from our group in January because he went behind another guys back and did what I hate which is try to leave your friends. Then my girlfriend and I broke up in April which was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I found help in her friend  who was my guardian angel but I could never honestly tell I loved her like Romeo loved Juliet. I then finished my exams  and started to hang around with new friends  which was an amazing experience but then I went to a house party two weeks after a night out and I started to chat up the girl who hosted the party  while I was in Greece and when I went out I asked to meet up with me and we made out much to her saying we didn't. Then I got the I see you as a friend text which I didn't mind but what she did after was awful she saw me in town and laughed and pointed at me and I went home to cut again.....July got worse, one of my Grans friends which I was very close to died and it broke my soul into pieces. August rolled in and this is where shit really hit the fan turns out for me making out with his ex a lad from a really rough area wanted to fight and then aniexty showed it's ugly head again and the panic attacks again. I planned to go to a back to school event but me and a few of the lads bailed so we stayed at my house here I heard the most awful news of my life, one of my friends made out with my ex and I had a breakdown in front of my friends at 3 in the morning it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced it was just soul crushing. Then I went out to a girl I thought I could get closer to, to have a chat about things and she bailed on me for her friends so I went home to cut my wrists again because I honestly think I'm not good enough for anybody  School has started back up and I'm in 10th grade now and a few weeks back I met up with a girl I've had my eye on for a while and I've fallen hard for her I didn't care about her face or all that it was her mind that got me. I was gonna persist with her but she's been dry as the Sahara and just being a bitch so I'm 100% sure now I'm gonna die alone. I've had a breakdown,2 panic attacks and my cousin died from suicide,she hung herself and she was 29 and had a 6 year old girl and was single mum.But this week has just been awful for me so Wednesday night was a large night out from where I'm from so naturally me and my friends has some alcohol before and we got really drunk so we got  into the club and I said hi to everyone but then I saw my ex and I just erupted I screamed ""YOU'VE DRIVEN ME TO SUICIDE I HATE YOU SO MUCH I HOPE YOU DIE IM GONNA KNOCK OUT YOUR LITTLE BUCK TOOTH BROTHER"" and I got kicked out of the club after 10 minutes and outside I was held down by bouncers to calm down but as soon as they had their backs turned I ran out in front of a car but I was held back by 5 lads from the estate down the road missing the car by 2 metres. It also turns out that I told the girl i had fallen hard for that was a stuck up pompous bitch and just for the record I'm ashamed of what I did So I ask you a question is life worth living for me or should I end it all?

Probs gonna end it on my birthday tomorrow,"Im gonna turn 24 tomorrow, and I feel like im a waste of time and resources for my parents and society. In my 24 years ive contributed absolutley nothing to anyone or done anything that brings value to anyone. Everyday despite how hard it is for me to gather my myself to get up out of bed, i do it for my parents because I dont want to disappoint them any further and I try, but everynight i get home a failure. All my peers and collegues are amazing and moving up in the world, have careers, finished uni, have partners and are loving life and everyday im going downhill, failing university, not performing well at work and im my social life.Before when people used to ask me what i want to do in 5 years time, I responded with some optomistic bullshit where I would run my own business or some shit but now if anyone ask me, I cant even see past the next day let alone 5 years.I know I have amazing family, and I have a number of good friends and thats the only reason I keep getting up in the morning to try again. But if i was to describe myself i would say I am useless, worthless, unmotivated, lazy and a terrible person but most of all just downright pathetic.

Fukt,"When I was 8 years old, I chewed a pen cap to
the point of sharpness and carved ""fukt"" on my knuckles. I should have known then what I ultimately know now. There is nothing in this world for a 'person' like me. I'm a narcissist, a loner, a complete asshole, a sad tune. I've been a professional cook for the past 14 years of my life. Which makes sense. I would have never thought I would have the job I have now, but the mere thought of walking into chaos and disarray five days a week bums me out even more than breathing does. Sure, kitchen work is the only work I know. I should be appreciative of making the most money I have ever made. I'm not. Recently, me and my girlfriend have been going through a rough patch. I calmly talked to her about how she needs to help with bills, rent, and other things for our apartment. I added that she has been very cold towards me, which I attributed to her grieving process of a lost co-worker in December. Previously mentioned, I'm no saint. I spew smartassed comments like a broken hose. I need my personal time. I like to play guitar until all hours of the night. You would have thought being together for 3 years, she would have tried to get her act together.Alas, 3 days later she turns and says something to me that I can't stop thinking about: ""I've been thinking about our conversation on Monday. You're right. But, I can't give you what you deserve. I'm going to move back in with my parents. My brother is on his way to help pack everything up. He's 15 minutes away."" What a load of garbage. I was a gentleman. Honestly, I was. I calmly started gathering her things and loading them into her and her brothers car. At this moment, as calm as I was, I knew my old suicidal feelings were starting to muster inside of me. She said we would talk soon. I didn't believe her. I went back into my dusty apartment and laid on my bed. I had the thought that I never wanted to see her again after the way she walked away from me. I quickly got up, went to the computer, and deleted every picture and post that we  ever shared on every social media outlet. I blocked her, her friends and her family members. I didn't want reminded of this person who I loved so very deeply.It scares me that I didn't cry. We are on talking terms now, but leaving the way she did hurt me in a place I've never been hurt before. I told her that. She agreed we needed to talk. I explained how I felt in great detail. I told her I didn't know if I could trust her ever again after the way she left. If a person chooses to abandon you for asking for help in basic life situations, I'm pretty sure they will leave you just as quickly if something serious happens. She wants to work things out. I don't know if I can get over the massive breach of trust and a knee-jerk reaction to leave me in the dust. This isn't the first time I battled with ending my own life. 4 years ago, I ate a ton of Vicodin and sleeping pills combined with a half bottle of Jameson. Waking up from that was terrifying. You can't move your arms or legs as fast as you want. It's a pretty surreal feeling. I remember thinking, ""I bet two more vicodin would have done it."" She would pick me up from work every day. I don't drive. I have a depth perception problem and doctors have repeatedly informed me I am ""physically unable to drive."" And I believe them. The problem is pretty bad. But, now that I have an hour and 45 minute bus ride home after getting my dick kicked in all day at work, it just makes me feel even more shitty. I don't drive. I don't care for work. The woman I loved with all of my heart left me in the lurch. I don't have the strength to carry on any longer. At 29 years of age, I was supposed to be over feeling this way. I was supposed to be happy and generally healthy. I'm not. I just want everything to stop. I want the thoughts to stop. I want to stop being confused. I want to stop feeling like this is the end. And I can't. I can't see the road ahead. I can't see a future worth living for. I can't see a love worth living for. I can't stop thinking about how I'm going to end my life. I still haven't shed a single tear. And I feel like that says more than I ever could to myself.

I never got to be a teenager.,"Hey everyone, hope your night has been better than mine. I've been lying in bed for about 4 hours now trying to think of a reason to move but I just cant find one. I'm 20 years old and I disgust myself. I can't get a job and my parents pay for my apartment and my college. They think that I have a plan to use my major and that I'm having the time of my life at this school but the truth is I'm completely lost and alone. My grades are fine but I'm not on track to graduate or get any internships (a death sentence in todays economy). I also spend every night locked in my room alone listening to my roommates and neighbors party. In a year or so I'm going to have to take care of myself completely: get a job I hate and be even more isolated than I am now. I don't want that. I want to be a teenager again. I spent my teens being a nerdy straight edge loser. I never went to dances in high school, never asked out any of my crushes, never went on a spring break, never got drunk in college, never rushed a fraternity, never made friends in the dorms, never got to experience young love.I missed out on so many parties, events and memories during the most important decade of my life and its left me to be an emotionally stunted shell. I have nothing to look forward to except work and loneliness because all of the best things in life passed me by. Whenever I remember all the old young adult stories I read in middle school I can barely believe that I'm actually older than all of those characters. I feel like a child, scared and helpless. I'm weak, unattractive to women and made fun of by guys. Its all my fault for letting my teens escape unchallenged. I'm soft, lazy and completely outmached by the amazing, beautiful and motivated people that surround me.If I had just done things differently for the last few years I probably could have had everything I want: friends , sex, career prospects; but instead I'm burning away my parents life savings to sit and cry alone on a squeaky bed.

Good bye everyone thanks for trying,Just wanted to say good bye to everyone on Reddit. I made a post on this sub asking for help. You can probably find it by looking at post I have made.

I was suppose to hang out with said person on the night I posted it. That did not happen. Was suppose to hang with said person tonight but I was bailed on again. It has crushed what little bit of hope I had left. Granted I was going to off myself some time soon any way. All I wanted was to say good bye to her. Any way thank you Reddit for being there.

Best of luck to anyone out there that is down and is posting on this sub. Hang tight. The people on Reddit will try and help you in any way they can. Keep doing what you do Reddit.

i'm 15 and have suicidal toughts since 9. How tf do I do something with my life ?,"I don't know why. I don't know how.

When will it end?,"Since 14 (almost 26 now) I've wanted to kill my self for so many times I've stopped counting. It's always the same, I feel there is something wrong, I have a strong anxiety attack and then I start to think of committing a suicide. I start to look for the best way how to do it, then my calming pills start work, I cry myself to sleep and the next day I want to visit a doctor and tell her I need help. Sometimes I do that, sometimes I don't. She sends me to see a psychiatrist and then to another psychiatrist and they all will prescribe some pills that help me to sleep but never to solve any of my obsessive thoughts of committing suicide. Then I live normally again for few days, weeks, if I'm lucky even months...and then it's
back. It will always come back. Right now the frequency of these attacks is increasing. Few months ago I moved and now I live alone which I don't really handle well, I try to overcome my breakup that has happened almost 8 months ago after 3 years together while I still love him, I have a new job which is stressful on it's own (high school teacher here) and I haven't still finished my uni programme and the time flies so fast without me doing anything productive. So now I'm sitting here, writing this stuff so that I don't browse the suicide advices websites and I'm asking myself what the hell is wrong with me? I'm young, very attractive, intelligent, kind person who has the whole future ahead of her, but I'm just unable to appreciate it, because there is something very wrong inside of my head. People around me would never expect it as I come off as a confident, popular extrovert and it makes it even more difficult to actually speak about this with anyone in my life. My parents know about it, but we are not in much of contact and my friends have their own lives and problems. This is a vicious circle. If it ever ends, it will be not a happy-end. Another worthless person who wishes nothing else than go to sleep and never wake-up. One day it is going to happen. Hopefully it will be done by the hand of fate/god/whatever and not by my hand. The odds right now are on the latter though.

I want to use suicide as a means of getting my father to listen,"Now, here's the context:My father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger. Aunt found out, told my mother, i dug deeper and found some other things as well. Happened 2 months ago, parents still have huge fights everyday. Now, back then, i loved my father. He's a very hard worker, working from 10 am up to 1-2 am with no breaks. And he still found time to spend with us on weekends. But after we found out, he changed. Bad. He began being cold, ruthless. I already blamed myself for all those fights (since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger), but he threw even more shit at me. Started shouting at me. Everything i did was wrong. Restricted me from the internet and going out with friends. I have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take it.Before the fights, i was depressed but now i'm depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. I can't bear this anymore. He won't listen when i plead, he won't listen when i scream, he won't listen when i reason, maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates severe emotional distress, depression, and contemplation of self-harm, which signifies a crisis level requiring immediate attention and support.",False,,,A3
Why can't I just go back?,"I've posted here before. Sorry for being so needy.I want to go back to around this time last year. Not to change anything, just to be able to be a little bit happy again. I've made progress in transitioning, but I've lost almost everything important to me in the process, and I hate it. If I could have just a tiny bit of joy in my life then, why can't I now that I've made progress in changing my life for the better? It makes no sense.There's so much that I've gained this year. Starting my transition, finding new forms of entertainment, finishing required classes for my major. But if I could just repeat those classes, that time, over and over and over again, I would. The professor was the best person I've ever met, and I made more friends during one semester than I ever made before or since.And now, as soon as those classes were over, they left. Every single one of them. The first people in my life I truly treasured from the bottom of my heart, gone in a flash. I've attempted suicide twice since then, and I wish I succeeded.I know it's nonsense to hope for something good to come out of suicide, but I don't see any other way to be happy. I'm an emotionally unstable wreck with nobody and nothing. If nothing else, maybe it would make people look at me, see me. I wish someone would realize that they cared, but the only people in my life are those who have already forgotten and those who would forget about me within a few months.So what do I do? Do I continue even though I'm dying inside, or do I just get it over with? I've heard ""it gets better"" so many times. Why hasn't anything changed? But it's stupid that I would expect it to after only a few months.What am I doing with my life? I just want attention. It's so shallow. Why should I care? But even if it's abusive attention, it's better than nothing. My family all say they love me, but why don't they reach out? Within 30 minutes of my second suicide attempt, no-one checked up on me or even messaged me. My sister and two of my brothers never said anything at all. My other brother talked for me for a few minutes after I reached out because he wasn't busy at the time. My parents just wanted me to go to the hospital so they could go to the gym instead of ""looking after"" me. What's wrong with me? Why am I so worthless? What did I do? Even as a child, I was literally forgotten until I pestered someone for a few minutes of them ""caring"".What's up with the double standard? Whenever my siblings ""succeed"", they're praised and celebrated. When I do the same or better, I get a ""Oh, well, good job, then."" My mother told me that she had a miscarriage of a female baby between my older brothers (twins) and me. I'm MtF trans.  Why would you tell me that?Because I excelled academically, I graduated high school early. When my brothers were 18, my parents had them start paying rent, since they'd graduated and could move out. I had to start paying at 16. I need that money to transition. I can't afford a lot of the stuff I need anyway.I made all sorts of stupid, outrageous promises just to get people to look at me for a little while. Now I have to keep them. I don't want to, but at least that way someone might look at me, praise me, for a little while.I'm lost. I want to try to OD again. I understand that I'll feel better in the morning. But that just feels fake. I don't want to be fake like that. I'd rather die than deceive myself.Should I stop taking my medications? At least the voices in my head and the people who weren't there would pay attention to me. At least there was somebody who would talk to me. Do I want to lose myself like that? Do I want to risk that I might kill someone without realizing what I'm doing? I don't know. I guess I might as well try it before I kill myself. But I don't want to wait.I don't even know why I'm posting this.

Hanging on a thread,"Hi I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go.Very long post ahead.
Advanced sorry for the shitty formatting.So I'm currently with a girl (we havent been together for long) and this is the happiest time of my life so far. I'm dead set on making this work. At the beginning I thought that if this fails, I'll never go for a relationship again but it turned into something worse. I'd literally choose her over everything. Every outcome I aim for is literally for our relationship and time together(or so i'd like to think) .I was a bit depressed and a bit suicidal before we got together. Just a bit. No actual acts involved. Though I was thinking very hard to go to a therapist because I felt I was going down that sad inevitable path.Now I realized that I became fully dependent to her. There were times we came close to a breakup and my thoughts were only zeroing in to suicide. Like there was never another option but that.She's nice but sometimes she'd like to mess with me (not very serious) but sometimes because of anxiety and trust issues I'd take it seriously but she still won't stop. (for instance I asked who's this guy then she'd answer in a manner that'd make anyone think there's something between the lines).Sometimes it leads to an endless cycle of fight that would end up with me apologizing like I'm begging for my life. Because I probably am.A hint of cheating(although unlikely) from her would also give me attacks of ""those"" thoughts. And it' d be enough to keep me wide awake until it gets resolved somehow. We havent fought for a time now. And I'm desperately fighting to keep it this way and fortunately there hasnt been anything weird hsppening lately but it's inevitable. I just want to make sure that I'll make it through next time. With her fortunately. In my current state, I probably wont last 3 weeks without talking to her. I'd be dead by the end of the 2nd week. I'm wish I am joking but I have enough anger and sadness to push myself from a high place when I'm at a really bad place. (almost seriously did it once. Stood on top of a footbridge for almost two and a half hours. The only thing that kept my feet on the ground was the fact that she hadn't broken up with me yet but was very close to doing so) Everything my life is depends on this relationship right now. I have a lot of hobbies but nothing makes anything work in me when we're fighting. Even the things I love the most turns into nothing when we're fighting. I'm paralyzed. So basically, I want to be less dependent. For the sake of both of us. Having someone commit suicide because of you is kind of traumatic(at least for me).If she ever breaks up with me, i want to last a bit longer than two weeks. She may get convinced that she's not the reason or something. I dont know. Im a mess. I dont even have a reason for writing this right now. I just think I should. Having to live without her is something I can never do at this point. This is the cringiest thing ive ever written but I have no other way of asking for help.

"Unbreakable ties. (tl;dr at end, kinda?)","It's really the only reason I'm actually living currently.I live an absolutely hopeless life.  I'm young, yes, only 17.  I haven't really been through any physical shit, though, just really mental.It all felt really mellow, calm, and weak.  Those are the words I can think of to describe it right now.  Years have blended together, and I don't remember many parts of my life, even though it's so short.I don't remember anything in detail before February 27th.  A few days after my birthday.  If you ask me to remember my birthday, I just remember the cake my brother got the image on it for.  It was some ironic meme I really liked and I couldn't stop laughing, and I think that was the best laugh I had ever had in my life.  Then my dad left us ""for good"", only to return 3 months later, without warning.I don't share things with friends.  I've never really had a real friend.  The closest I've had to this day is someone who's arguably more mentally fucked up than I am.  I haven't gone to the beach with some friends, or had a campfire with toasted marshmallows.  The closest thing I've had to that is going on a small camping trip where, while we did do those things, there was infighting before the trip, so it wasn't easy talking and whatnot.  As usual, I played as the guy who would start conversations, act like the idiot I've always been to cheer people up, make jokes, play along, you get the idea.I've only really been useful as a tool.  My life, beginning from when I got an injury, has been this way.  A condition fucked up my leg (It's considered a ""disease"" but it really isn't, it's just an internal physical fuck up) and I couldn't continue my martial arts.  I was 3 belts away from a black belt, and the injury worsened dramatically on the day of my graduation to the next one, to the point where I had to cancel my part on the very day.  I felt so ashamed, even though it wasn't anything I could control.From then on, the doctors told me I couldn't do physical activity.  I was skinnier than a string bean so I saw this as a positive thing at first, but no man, no.  It ruined my life.  The worst part of it was that it was so insignificant; nobody could really realize it was there.  I could feel the disappointment seeping through my P.E teachers' eyes.  I would just sit out every damn time because I had no fucking choice.Ever since then.  I became a tool.  I couldn't walk home, I couldn't walk with my friends home.  I couldn't walk to McDonalds at lunch time, I couldn't walk to my school.  I spent time alone.  So, so much time alone.  I read shitty books, I started playing video games more, I was so close to becoming a shut in, but then this girl came into our school when I was in Grade 7.  (G6 was when I was injured)Lots of details cut, I got a crush on her.  Skip to Grade 10, after lots happened in between, she one day comes to our normal classmate lunch spot on the verge of crying.  I, self-proclaimed genius, end up saying the EXACT wrong words; not exaggeration or anything, either, I basically explained the problem, said why it's bad, then said ""but it's fine!!!"", to sum it up.  Shunned by the mass over there, and so, so fucking rightfully so, I walk back to the corner, with the thought ""holy shit, did I deserve that!"", the feeling of a despicable human being, eating my lunch, and get this; she comes over to me and gives me pity.Yep, about right at that point, I realized something.  Two things, actually.  I don't deserve this.Why?Why did she have to do it?  I don't know.  I'll never know.  I could ask, but I won't get a right answer, let's be honest.I have ties, now.  I think now that if that had never happened, my exit from this shitty existence would just be a detriment to my parents and brother, but no.  Now I've got someone else I owe it to.I'm just a tool.  I didn't explain earlier, but when my parents were in constant quarrels, I was the tiebreaker.  My brother is the literal definition of an asshole and an airhead, my dad is an idiot to such an extent that he ends up just being an ass, and my mom is the definition of pity.My brother, two years younger than me, smokes weed frequently, does really fucking stupid shit ever since he started, acts like an asshole, and forces me to listen to rap, convinced that I am supposed to like it.  Spoilers: I despise rap, but nothing goes through his head.  This mess of a human is the direct result of my parents being too late.  My dad leaving was the ignition to his engine of wrongdoings.My mom being the definition of pity, is a fucking airhead.  After all the time; from 2015 to early 2017, that I spent trying to help her with my dad, she takes it all for granted, focuses on herself once he left, and completely forgets that she has another son; my brother.My dad, Sir. Fuckington the Idiot, III, leaves for 3 months, only a few days after my birthday, and when he comes back, completely without warning, he acts as if he never left, and as if he's a better person.  I was introduced to another mask.  It looks just like the ones all the people in my school wear, except it's much lighter, since you can actually see the absolute asshat peeking through time to time.  The eyeholes are too big, in my opinion.I helped my mom with her emotional struggle with my dad, I helped my dad become a better person, which he always tries to act like he is one, except he's a pretty big idiot, so there's that, and then there's my brother.  I can't do anything about him, so I urge my parents to take some sort of fucking action, but they're both FUCKERS who don't have any brains as far as I'm fucking aware.And, of course, there's her.  This girl who just drops into my life like I owe her something, makes me love her, and then, she's leaving after Grade 12.  All the while, she's harboring more pain than I could imagine of.[tl;dr?]Man, how the fuck am I supposed to live with this?  This is bullshit.  I'm good at this, but I never get a fucking chance to show it to anyone but family.  They barely deserve it, they just took it for granted, and now they too wear masks.  I'm sick of this, and I want to just fucking scream.  Maybe this is all I should've said.  Everyone around me is hiding.  I've gone so far to just hide my depression to bring out people's true emotions, but they hide.  I talk to them with my mental state in mind, and they just brush it off.  ""I'm fine"".  You're becoming adults, for fucks sake, TALK like adults.No, everyone hides everything.

What am I supposed to do?  I've wanted to kill myself for a couple years now but I keep holding on for these people.  Some guy last year decided to kill himself because his girlfriend broke up with him after he cheated on her.  I know the girl a bit, she was a very kind girl a few years back but after her family problems, she became just another mask.  After the incident, she disappeared.  She still goes to my school, but her emotions, her feelings, they don't even feel like they exist.It's gross.  It's so god damn disgusting.  I want to go to my school and yell at everyone from the top of my lungs to stop living this sick lie.  But it's far too late.  Everything's too late.I don't want to live in this world anymore, where nothing moves, and nothing has colour.  Where emotions are meaningless unless it's this sickeningly fake happiness everyone pretends to have.  Where friends are numbers, and love is a funny joke.God, I just want to die.  I so, so badly just want to fucking end it all.I'm really sorry this is so long.

18 Years Old and Sick of it. (Long Post),"I honestly just want it to be over. When I think about suicide (which, for me, is a regular occurrence), it somehow makes me feel happy.

"[Long, I'm Sorry] I called the National Suicide Prevention Helpline, twice, and I feel even worse.","Hello all, I would like to share my experience with the National Suicide Prevention Helpline, and get some input on both that and the original reasons I called in, but first, a little about me. I am a 27 year old college-educated female from a middle-class background.  I have a pretty typical story, physically and emotionally abusive dad and a mom that stood by and watched.  All of her emotional baggage was dumped on me from the beginning; from the times he would cheat, to her bankruptcy, she came to me to vent all of it every time.  I have looked out for her from the beginning, always putting her above myself since she had it so much harder, even getting between her and dad or her and my brother when verbal fights escalated. I became a drug addict at the age of 21 (opiates, of course), and have been battling that, too.  Anyhow, she spent her entire retirement money on a house near the beach to get away from dad, and took my heroin-addicted brother and his wife with her, instead of me, because they don't like me, even though I helped her find the house and it's her house.  She's always said I was her favorite and her best friend (although I don't believe you should be friends with your children).  She comes back to visit more often than not, which is good because I don't really leave the house, not even if I'm hungry.  As for the rest of it, very quickly, last year everyone died, and two years before that I made a plan that I have since perfected about killing myself (overdose) when my mom dies (she has an end-stage disease due to addiction), as I couldn't bear to hurt someone as badly as the loss of a child would hurt a mother.  The event that set this whole thing off was her telling me she would be home one day, then changing it to two days later, then changing it yet again.  I had a sort of epiphany, where I realized my entire life, she has told everyone only what she thought they wanted to hear, or what would keep a fuss down.  This included me.  I then realized that I was staying alive for someone who I'm not entirely sure really cares all that much about me.  There's much more, but that's the gist of it. As for the helpline, I know that they can only talk for a certain amount of time, and both phone calls lasted less than 5 minutes.  I told them I was 27, my mom had lied to me one too many times, and I have had a planned suicide for three years now.  One said ""Why can't you be happy that she's happy at the beach"", while the other said ""What were you calling about again"", and, as I repeated myself, was cut off and told that they're open 24/7.  Both of them made me feel like it was my fault and I was being selfish, I think mostly because they weren't listening. I'm obviously not upset that she's happy, I'm upset that she lies just to make things easier for herself, when she alone (well, along now with all you good people) knows how fragile I am.  I'm not going to make this post any longer; if you have any questions, please post them and I will answer as soon as possible. Thank you for reading my post.Update: Hello all, I appreciate each and every one of your replies.  It seems like those helplines aren't very helpful to some, who may just be those most in need.  Unfortunately, that's how it goes.  Someone asked why I don't leave the house often, and that's because I have severe depression and panic attacks, and, in spite of many different medications and combinations, along with therapy, none of it seemed to work in the decade between my diagnoses and when I lost my health insurance last year, so ERs are out of the question.  I'm glad (I guess?) that others have been through similar events, and grateful they could keep me company during a time of need.  Just a simple reply means so much during stressful situations, so to all those lurking, you never know how much you might help someone with one minute of your time.

I really have tried I just don't have the energy or hope anymore.,"I grew up for eight years with a mother who has BPD. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a incredibly abusive and toxic personality disorder.
My Father allowed this for years, until she attempted suicide underneath my bed on one Thanksgiving and was removed from my home.Following this I grew up with maids and nannys because my father was often at work. One of them was abusive towards me for serval years but never left marks on my body. My father never believed me. So when CPS came over (as they did multiple times) nothing was ever done.I was sent to a boarding school for two years when I was a teenager by my ex stepmother. Whom my father married after knowing her for a week on eharmony. Really fucked up place. One of the staff members that managed me actually gave birth to a child under her dorm room deck and left it there to die (Google: Jesscia Bradford, JYA), no one noticed until it started it stink.As an adult. It look me awhile to get used to being a person again if that makes sense.
I took some LSD, went to some amazing music festivals.
I stopped drawing as often and became an aerialist, it was extremely cathartic. Doing it professionally across the country helped me see and experience a lot.Starting last year I cried about it a bit, then got over myself and became a stripper.
Gigs alone were good money but weren't enough to keep me moving forward in life while in a stable place. Also my father had quit working at that point because of his depression, my family was living off of food donations at home. I knew I needed to do something for my future that was fast money.
 The job itself can be pretty depressing (sometimes hilarious), but overall excellent money.
I worked hard for a year. I bought a car, payed off all previous medical debts, furnished my apartment..Things were finally starting to look up for me. I was finally starting to get stable and then start saving to go back to college.
Then I found out my family had lost health coverage because my father quit paying the bill six months ago, I was once again swamped with medical debts that were not my fault (also may I add I found this out after I had loaned him money for his car payments that month, he knew what my job was)  this time.I injured myself while training last month. I have no health insurance to get treatment, I cannot walk around to go make money to afford the treatment or get another job. I have 1000$ saved and that will only get me an MRI.
My county indigent will not take me. I make too much per month.

I'm tried of feeling alone with no one to turn to for help. I'm sick of feeling trapped.
If I have to live in a country where people are so selfish for resources that we don't even have tax paid universities and tax paid doctors... I don't think I want to exist in it anymore.

And if I think of myself dead, my body still kinda warm but the skin a little bit blue-green from the blood flow stopping, I feel the pain softeningI wish to kill myself in a few months, but I don't know how, If I have to do it, It must be done well, I need something that will not leave me alive and paralized on a chair of the hospital.Other than that I wish to become rich, buy Louis vuitton bags, gucci and versace shoes have a sports car, a home in switzerland, work in the fashion world, designing clothes or doing the make up on runway models, making a movie, watching every movie on earth and being part of a group of cinema addicts, have a partner maybe, and most of all buy euthanasia (money can't buy happiness but it can buy the ethernal sleep)I'm discussing my gender identity too, that's very confusing, but most of all I want all of this 'beautiful' thing called life to be over. I hope the f words can be said here, it's hard to express my feelings, I know..",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2

I will be free this weekend.,"I don't know why I'm even bothering to post on here, but I don't have anyone else to open up to so here I am, I guess. I've been depressed for 7 years now, and this past year has been the worst. I've never really liked who I was as a person, I'm fat, ugly, untalented, socially awkward, incapable of getting a girlfriend...the list just goes on. I tend to stick to hobbies/things that I feel like I'm good at, but I tend to shift away from them after not too long cuz I just realize that I'm completely shit at everything. I just can't do anything right. The only thing I'm good at is school at this point, and I'm losing passion for the very major that made me go to school. I'm in a great school (top 10 in the world for my field of engineering) and have a good gpa, but I feel like I've given up everything to get there. And I'm realizing that I'm really not that smart...i'm just good at school. And not only that, but being the socially awkward fuck that I am, I can't really get back into being social. I'm a horrible mess, and I hate being me.This past year has been rough because I lost my best friend. Long story short, I ruined the friendship, and she's moved on. I still open her snapchat stories, crying and reminiscing about how things once where. She was the only one I've ever opened up to. We were best friends for 6 years...and she's gone. I don't know how to live like this.Sorry if this is getting long...I'm just miserable. I'm going to blow my brains out with a shotgun this weekend, same way my father died years ago. I'm empty and dead inside and I miss my bestfriend. I'm sorry, Sara. I know I promised you that I would never do this, but I can't.

Not Doing So Hot,"I'm not even sure where to begin. I'm 24, graduated undergrad in May with a double major and am currently working on a paralegal certification.I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for around ten years at this point. Over the past year or two especially I've been losing the fight to agoraphobic tendencies. I can't imagine finding or holding down a job. I feel panicky just meeting up with somebody or running errands.I used to have so many close friends. People drift but.. it's been months since anyone reached out. I've exhausted myself trying to make friendships and relationships work with other people.I flipped out on my ex today. We stopped talking for a while. Recently started talking again and found out she's dating already after a variety of ""I can't be with anyone"" bullshit when we broke up. Told her I can't deal with being shoved off to the side for other people. I can't handle having such strong feelings for somebody anymore. I've never known that something so beautiful (love) could be so destructive.I can't imagine my future. I've always sort of had it in my head that one day I'll just off myself. I feel like that day is rapidly approaching much faster than I thought it would.I feel as though I'm losing/have lost everything. My dad's dying from cancer, all of my closest friends have made their own lives in new places. I tried reaching out to a ton of people tonight and couldn't get a single response.I don't really know what the point of this is.. I'm terrified of death, and of hurting my family, but I'm scared that if things continue the way they have been, those fears won't matter so much anymore.It's been a gentle downward slope for the last two years; the past 6 months in general have just been one thing after another.I don't know what to do. I'm the ""smart and funny"" guy. Or I was when I was more social. I can't keep up hiding behind a happy face. I just drove aimlessly for an hour today crying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I could be such a successful and happy person if I could just fix my mental illness issues.I'm laying in bed right now having a panic attack wishing I could rip myself out of my own skin.

I feel like the meaning of life is to end it,"I'm in my first year in uni, final trimester. I have a beautiful girlfriend who tries her best to understand, but I don't know how to explain how painful and crippling every day is. I dance in my spare time, but lately I feel like an idiot for even picking up something I'll never be good at. I hate that school makes me feel stupid, I hate that there's toxicity everywhere, I hate the fact that I push people away everytime someone tries to be close or be my friend. I hate that I know they're talking about me, but mostly I hate that I don't think I can ever change. My parents'll try to care for a while before totally putting it aside a week or two later. They think I can handle it. But I can't. I tried to jump once but a passerby grabbed me, threw me to the floor and saved me. Sometimes I hate him for doing that. I hate myself. I try to kid myself and say I'm a good person - people say that I am, my girlfriend says that I am. But I know I'm not. I'm the biggest asshole there is.

Always praying and wishing for death,"This is going to be long, I don't know what to do or where to go. I've never felt so lost in my life and I know all the sequence of events that got me here but I was too young to control them and the adults around me too foolish to see them.I don't know what I want from writing this but I need to vent, I've cried myself to sleep the last few nights and I only want to die, I only want death's sweet embrace.If I dig deep back to my earliest memory, it's me eating a bowl of corn flakes with orange juice, there is no earlier memory, this was before pre-k (age 4). It was only when I started going to preschool that I realized something was different...Parent's talked to their kids, they hugged them, they laughed with them, they told them that they love them. It blew my 4 year old mind wide open. My parents didn't do that (my eyes are getting watery).My parents never hugged me, never told me they loved me and never gave me affection by any standard in the United States at least. I felt no love growing up and watching the people around me, it hurt.I have 3 older siblings, our age gaps range from 4-10 years. We grew up like strangers because of our parents yet we lived in the same house. My two older brothers always treated me like shit and I was the punching bag. I always got the worst of it. I never really spoke to them growing up.At school, I didn't make too many friends, I think by the time I hit first grade I was already broken. I had no one to talk to at home, my parents frequently beat me with wooden spoons, hot pans, belts (metal side too), flip flops, fists, etc. My siblings beat me...I don't remember having friends, I remember loneliness and crippling depression.In 7th grade I was introduced to public school in a new state, it was my first time going to public school. Being brown I was called a terrorist immediately and bullied. I tried to defend myself but I was scrawny and weak. I used to have so much patience at this time in my life...it was slowly erodedAt school it was just bullying and harassment. At home it was just bullying and harassment. Bullied by peers, parents and siblings I only wanted to die. I knew I wanted death for a long time at this point but I was too scared. I held a knife to myself many times but I was always too scared.I went through middle school and high school creating a facade that I was happy, that I wasn't suffering from crippling depression. Everyone believed it, including my family. Through middle school and high school I probably cried myself to sleep almost every night, I had giant bags under my eyes which I still have to this day at 24. I would pray to God on a daily basis to kill me, to end it all or help me end it all. I went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable I really believe in life after death, I believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere I don't want to go. I suffered so much in this life already, how can I kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity. I don't know what I want out of writing this but I just really want to die so badly.I felt better in college, I felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends I still felt it...my baseline emotion at this point was crippling depression.I realized I don't know how to actually make friends, I have had so so very few friends in my life. I have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing me.No one really knows but I partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak of...I'm looking for that now and I realize it's just like anywhere else. I still have trouble making friends and I really don't know how to fix it. Some people I just click with, maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest I just don't have anything to talk about, I don't know what to say. I don't want watch any sports, I don't like that stuff. I'm weird and I always try and keep that happy facade up....Lately, the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that I cant help but cry myself to sleep. I just want a friend, I just want someone to talk to, I just want to die. I pray to God that I can get into some kind of car accident where only I'll get hurt and die. I pray I can die in my sleep, I pray to have a heart attack, to get cancer, to die some sudden death or get run over. I pray that God takes the breath from my lungs.I don't love anyone on this planet, I have no desire to stay here. I have no attachments. All I've ever wanted in this life is to have my own family, someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly. A real family, not the bullshit hand I was dealt...but it's hard.My parents let me eat like garbage growing up, we never went out to eat but all I really ate was cheese and pasta. My body never properly developed if you look closely. My head is smaller than most males as is what's between my legs, they are both closer to a childs. My body even though people think I'm muscular is soft and pudgy. I am undeveloped, my emotions are a mess, my mind is a mess. I don't know what to do with my life...I don't know why I'm writing this or what I want, I just know that if I was offered the opportunity to die, I would take it in a heartbeat. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear I'll go to hell but oh my gosh...I wish someone would kill me, the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling, it hurts living each day. Everyday I stop caring about hell just a little bit because I want to leave this world... I want the pain to end, I want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit: I think I know what I want ...I mean I want friends, I want people to talk, I want to be normal but I know that takes time.For a while I used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought. I want to know how I can get out of this, I want it to stop until death can find me.

I FINALLY figured it out.,"I think I've been ready to die for a very, very long time. I can remember a time, back when I was 12 years old, and I was watching ""The 4400"" with my mom and older brother. There was this episode (I'm sorry I can't be more specific, it was a decade back) where people had created a ���shot�۪ that could be given to ���normals�۪ ��� and they had exactly a 50/50 shot if either getting superpowers, or dropping dead. Both my mother and brother debated while the credits rolled, each determining that, even for the chance at getting some amazing powers, they wouldn�۪t want to risk losing their lives. I said something along the lines of ���But it�۪s a win wither way! You can either join the 4400, or you don�۪t have to live anymore.�۝  . . . I still remember the looks on their faces. I think it was the first time I started to think of myself as a freak.I�۪m 23 years old. And I fucking hate myself. I think all people are inherently valuable from that which they bring into the world and people around them. How does one measure a person? By their impact. And for as long as I can remember, i have found myself lacking. I am truly ugly, a round face and dank hair and a potato of a body that trips and stumbles and brushes into other people without their consent or desire. I�۪m weak, emotionally and physically ��� couldn�۪t fight to save my life, and wouldn�۪t have the strength of mind to do it anyhow. I�۪m manipulative ��� so many people look at me and think that I am a good, sweet thing that only smiles and offers lame jokes and loves life, when in fact I detest living with every particle of my being, and am able to fool everyone I know just by acting like anything matters to me, when I am in fact growing more and more certain that nothin, nothing, NOTHING does at all. I�۪ve always unerringly thought myself a fine actress ��� and the fact that no one around me known enough of my turmoil to think that my jokes about ���can�۪t wait to die�۪ might just be real really proves it. I�۪m stupid, and in a field where I will never bring discernible contribution to the world around me, other than serving people who, like myself, don�۪t give a shit about me. I�۪m sick and twisted and lost in memories and half-fucking-crazy; I am a liar and a thief and some diet-form of a sociopath. I�۪m Grayson, and I hate myself. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, killing myself wouldn�۪t be the best idea. I tried telling myself all of the usual things; my job will need me, my family will be devastated, my friends will miss me, there are so many things to look forward to, it gets better . . . white noise in my ears, anymore. My job doesn�۪t need me. I love what I do, and once imagined myself doing it forever . . . But let�۪s face it, it doesn�۪t take a genius to check people into a hotel, or manage budgets, or plan parties. I see coworkers getting promoted all around me, with less experience and less time in the industry and less (or no) education, and it just reinforces to me, over and over and over again, that I�۪�۪m not really hot shit at my job; I�۪m not going to do anything amazing, or make waves . . . I�۪ll just be in my entry-level position for another three years, working my ass off and still just not being good enough ��� because desire and ambition don�۪t make it in this world ��� connections and talent do. Neither of which I have. I am at the point where I have managed to convince myself that my family would understand why I did whatever it is I am going to do; my father was once suicidal, and he survived by the skin of his teeth . . . and made a change for the better in his life. And then he had my siblings, and spawned me into this world. I was never a very good daughter, the kind that my mother wanted and needed . . . but my little sister is there to help her through any loss she might feel in my death . . . And god, my little sister; she�۪s perfect, beautiful and smart and kind and funny and hard-working . . . She�۪s going places, and we all take pride in her every move; I like to think that she would be understanding about what happened, maybe a little sad, but knowing that I am worth more to a world I am not in than one I am consistently fucking up. My older brother doesn�۪t even know me anymore, hasn�۪t been interested in me for a long, long time. My little brother . . . well, we love eachother, but he�۪s a very sensible person, logical almost to a fault; he can understand that there is no point in living if you�۪re not going to do anything worthwhile with the gift you�۪ve been given. Truthfully, I think that the only ones I have any doubts about are my niece and nephew ��� I love the hell out of them; but they are so very young, sweet and impressionable and innocent . . . When I�۪m gone, it�۪ll only take a few years before they forget Auntie Grayson, and it will be better that way. Life is always better without me. I have three best friends in the world. One of them uses me, clearly and obviously, because I gratify her need for attention. I�۪d be of better use to her dead, because then she can revel in being the mourning friend of that dead girl. My second best friend is a strong woman, married and independent and tough as nails; she was fine before I came into her life, and she�۪ll be fine long after I�۪m gone. My last best friend, my oldest and most important . . . Well, about a year ago, she booted me our of her life, and told me she was better with me gone ��� and really, she was . . . the minute I was gone, she found a better job, managed to get engaged, and bought a house. We�۪re friends again, now, had a weepy reunion and all that bullshit, but there�۪s a hollowness there that was never acknowledged before. I mean, she clearly excelled when I was driven from her life; me ducking out now can only help her further. I am a bad person. I am toxic and shallow and wrong. I wish, sometimes, that someone would come and just beat the shit out of me so I could feel as if, maybe, just a little bit, I am making headway on the punishment I need . . . but I�۪ve been (un)lucky enough to avoid anything akin to that.I�۪ve started to realize that life doesn�۪t get better. I am 23 years old, have a good job and a boyfriend of more than a year that I love, I am almost done with schooling . . . And I feel nothing. I Google ���is it okay to want to die�۝ and ���why is my presence a blight upon this world.�۝ I drink sometimes, and it helps me sleep; I take burning hot showers because the tingles on my skin make me feel like someone is toughing me, like maybe I am being held, and sub sequentially held back . . . But nothing. I keep trying to rationalize my existence, I believe that everything happens for a reason . . . And I have done SOME good in my life, a drop in the bucket . . . but there�۪s really nothing more I can contribute to anyone, and I feel like my death is the next step. What is the point in hanging around if my purpose has been fulfilled? And, more to the point, my life ending would benefit the people I care about a good great deal; my family and friends would receive the benefit of my years of savings and frugality, my brother would have a completely paid-for apartment for another year, and all of my clothes and things could go to people who would actually appreciate them, to people who need them and want them and care. Some people, I think, just aren�۪t meant to be alive. Some of us are mistakes ��� and we need to correct mistakes. I think I�۪ve made up my mind to kill myself. It is not because I�۪ve had a bad life, or because anyone pushed me into it. For once, this is something I�۪m doing all on my own, and for once, it is something good. I feel so at peace, knowing that I finally made a choice. I don�۪t know when or how (though I imagine soon, and I hope with a gun). I�۪ve had a living will and a life insurance policy for some time, and all I really need to do is decide whether or not to leave a note. I don�۪t think I will. I don�۪t want people to remember me. I�۪m not sharing this to get advice or people telling me not to do it. I just wanted to be honest, just this one time, and tell someone what I am really thinking, what I am really feeling. And God, do I feel light. . . .Thank you for your time. Better luck next time.

I need to vent this out.. And maybe you're able to help me..,"Hi.. I want to commit suicide. But not really. I just got bored of life. Existence is pain.
Let's unload the cards.I'm an 18yo old male, gay (not out), only child in a disintegrating family.
Pretty depressed, anxious, introverted, nihilistic, melancholic.
Having mental breakdowns usually couple times per week
and thinking about suicide almost every day.
Going to sleep with a wish of not waking up.Still student. In a school i hate and i can't see myself having a 9-5 job.
I hate routines and I'm anti-social most of the time.
Haven't been in a relationship yet. Don't wanna be, thanks to self-hatred.
I see myself too much as a complex and unlovable person.
And i don't wanna hurt anybody.My family now basically consist only of my mother and grandma.
My mother have a really low self-confidence and self-esteem
and is under medication because she have some kind of mental illness.
My grandma is .. just normal stereotypical grandma.
Conservative and living alone.I have two close friends. One of them is my classmate. He mentally bullied me
over some period of time in elementary school but we became friends later.
I still don't know how i was able to forgive him when he was ordinarily making me cry.
But i did and he changed. I think he would take a bullet for me and i would do the same.
I would do the same for anybody, because i love other people.
I see others worth, but not myself.
For example, i just recently registered myself as a bone marrow donor to feel more ""useful"".I care about myself to a certain extent. I don't do drugs, i don't smoke, i don't drink
and I'm not promiscuous, like my peers.
I even started to do sports, to get rid of depression, at least for a while,
but it didn't last forever
I don't wanna have a long life. I'm not interested in having a job to make money and
being materialistic (i would like to, but i don't see purpose in it).
Or having a relationship or other deeper bond,
because i don't see purpose in it. Nothing is forever.
Maybe it will change when something happens. And it will not because i will still be who i am.
Bullshit. I'm having a little inner conflict. I see myself as a shitty person. That's why.
My friend recently asked me, just out of curiosity, if there's someone in a world I really
hate. Only person that came up in my head was myself, but i said nobody.I guess I'm not able to off myself normally. I thought about drinking to death
(since i don't drink at all, it would be interesting experience)
but that's not happening.
Because there are still people out there, that would be devastated by my death.
My mother, grandma and friends.
So i can only wish. And i still didn't let depression to take a full control over me.
But it's making it's own way up since i started thinking about more ways to overcome my
self-preservation instinct and emotional barriers. I just somehow accepted that
i will kill myself eventually in a future. I'm also often thinking about doing something heroic,
like saving someone's life somehow. Sacrifice myself.
So I'm stuck in this vicious circle. Thinking about doing something stupid and on the other side
knowing what should i do and what i shouldn't do. Something is still working right in my head i guess.I thought about other non self-destructive methods of getting my sh#t together.
Like talking to therapist or someone. But I'm not much talkative in person
and i wouldn't describe my problem as exactly as i did now, when I'm writing it.
I'm nerd, let's be honest.
And i would not take any medications. I have standards. That's related to my aversion
against alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and similar. I want to keep my body clean.
Another way i thought about is to get into some kind of relationship drama.
Having someone closer. Maybe i would get some confidence and experience.. I'm lonely.
Whatever. Nevermind, that's not happening, who would like a person that hates himself.
And I'm even pushing away my current friends
because i don't want them to see me as I am now. I would be rude and detached.
I also tried to channel my bad thoughts and depression (if i can call it depression)
and use it in some kind of a creative way. Like sports, or writing texts, lyrics and stuff
but i will quickly lose motivation because i don't see purpose in it.
Another thing that crossed my mind was
""F*ck it. You will not have a normal life. But you can
focus on what you like to do and learn.
You can be good at something and that will give you strength .. and purpose""
I always wanted to learn and understand things. But I'm too cynical and realist.
So.. cards are out and i don't know what to do next. I guess i will go watch another episode
of rick and morty and then go to sleep, wishing not to wake up next morning. I wish i was in peace with myself.

Suicidal because of heavy financial problems.,"Hey all,I've been having financial problems for the past 7 years or so and it's not because I'm financially undisciplined, in fact I'm frugal and smart about my money. I have terrible luck with employment (only ever had 1 full time job) and I am trying to save money to finish college. I have 3 courses left to finish college and get my bachelor's degree but the lack of it is heavily impeding my chances of holding a steady job that pays me enough to pay my student loans as well as save money for college.Due to this, I resorted to freelancing. It's been great, I've made some money but this financial problem is also with my family and whatever I earned I helped them and I paid my student loan that's due every month. But freelancing is volatile and right now I have an employer who will potentially give me projects but he needs to wait for his clients to pay him. Honestly at this point, I'm fully expecting it to fizzle out because life always finds a way to fuck me anyway.I blame nobody but myself. The path I've gone down has been hard and I could have chosen the easier path, but I made mistakes. All I want is to be able to earn a steadier income to help me build my life but life is just obstructing my path. If this project doesn't come through I'm back to square one and I feel like I should kill myself because I'm running out of energy to even handle this anymore. I'm lost and my mistakes have made a heavy impact on my family and myself. Why bother living if I consistently get fucked over no matter how hard I work and if I just caused burden and hardship to my family and myself? Fuck this life.Also, I don't have any issues with self esteem, women, etc. I'm a pretty normal person and I only need a damn job and money to get me out of this rut.

Trapped in a box. Mentally and physically.,"Hiya Reddit. I hope this is the right sub for this.I've been having suicidal thoughts for awhile now. I've had them for the past couple of years, but recently they've peaked pretty bad.A little bit about me. I'm 16 and bisexual. I live in the south in a medium sized-ish awful town in the great plains. We have a very high crime rate and awful weather usually. Also churches on every street corner so... Not the most LGBT friendly place.As a result of this you can imagine I'm heavily closeted. Which is stressful because my parents are also pretty homophobic. I actually asked my father once what he expected from me in life, and his response was ""Don't turn out gay."" Guess I just disappoint everyone I'm every way possible lol.I've been homeschooled since I was 8. Extremely socially isolated. My only friends are online. My parents are both paranoid conspiracy theory hermit types. They almost never take me anywhere.Also they pretty much gave up on homeschooling me about a year ago. So now I just lay in bed all day doing nothing pretty much. The way the days start to blend into each other is really... Disconcerting.I think I have alot of mental and emotional problems because of the social isolation, and because my parents were always kind of... Emotionally distant and weird. My mom has extreme anxiety problems and my father is very depressed most of the time. I've asked to see a therapist before but (being the conspiracy nuts that they are) they think all therapists are quacks and won't take me to one. (Also we're pretty poor. So affording it would be an issue.)I have hobbies. I play guitar. And I skateboard sometimes. But more and more everything feels meaningless and bland. I don't feel anything anymore. None of the things that made me happy really work anymore and... I don't have the energy to get up and exercise or improve myself.I'm in a rut but I don't see any ways out. None of my family cares or will help me. I've tried.

I'm tired of fighting,"I'm not sure how to start so bare with me.

I want to end it but the thing that's holding me back is my son but maybe my mom can just take care of him. I just want my pain to stop and I want to call my doctor to get some meds to feel better but I don't want to try the meds and just feel the exact same way. I hate my job. I'm a cna, most nights I'd rather just let all of my patients just lay in their own bodily fluids, most nights I just don't give two shits if I hurt them.

I've been passively planning my exit the last few years. Just need to do a brain dump now and get it out there,"I'm a male in his 30s, successful, healthy, people tell me they think i'm doing really well. I think almost everyone would be surprised to hear I am thinking about suicide. The last few years I have been planning my exit. I don't know when exactly i will do it, but probably before I turn 40.My friends are all married and having children, I am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work. I go to the gym a lot, I read, I have hobbies, I travel, I even moved across the country. I can improve lots of things about my life. I am a proud person and I am not helpless. Still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what I am going through. If I even hint at being depressed I get the old ""chin up, tough guy"" or people just stop calling. I also have very bad relationships with my family. I have one sibling and we will probably never speak again. Not close with my parents. I had one serious girlfriend, but we broke up years ago and I have not tried a serious relationship since then. Lots of flings and short term dating, but nothing serious and I don't think I could ever be in a relationship again.I just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live. I rarely experience any joy. I just work.. either at my actual job, or on hobbies and side projects, I am constantly working. The thing is, I like working. It gives me a purpose. Otherwise I feel like life is pointless. I have to make something out of my life. What else is there to do when you are my age? Dating is like torture to me. Everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time. I feel objectified and I never feel a connection. Sex is meaningless sensory stimulation. I enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty. The only thing I can offer women is sex or the superficial ""stability"" that women in their 30s want, basically to have a house and a car, the trappings of a ""successful life"". But that isn't what I want. I want to live a real life. I want somebody who likes books and doesn't care about bullshit. I have almost completely given up on women at this point, I'm tired of getting burned, and I don't want to date anyone i don't have a connection with.My sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection. Otherwise, i think I am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason, for decades and decades, until I am too old to work and i become useless. I can keep plucking away at some of my 'goals' for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances, friendly neighbors etc., but am I so crazy to think this isn't good enough? What is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and it's just you in a room alone?I don't want that to happen to me so I have started planning my exit. I don't feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life. I don't want to be around for those decades alone. It will be torture. I am going to give myself another 5-6 years and make sure I have my ducks in a row so I can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happen.The worst part is I can't tell anyone about this because I will be insulted and have them tell me i'm being a selfish cunt or that I'm just being ""dark"" for even thinking about giving up my perfect life.

I'm living 95% of my life for the 5% I'm happy.,"So yeah. 95% of the time I'm contemplating suicide. I've been told all my life that it's the most selfish thing one could do, but is ending your life really selfish if continuing to live would be worse? The top reasons I want to commit suicide are as follows:1) School. This is my first year in a public school (I've been homeschooled all my life). Now that I'm in the NCVA, my grades have plummeted, even though I spend a lot more time doing schoolwork. As a homeschooler, most of my test results were in the college level, as a public schooler, I'm below average. It's absolutely taken over my schedule, and it's the number one reason I want to die.2) My Mom. She certainly knows how to make my free time miserable. She treats nobody kindly, not even my Dad. She has no clue how to raise someone with autism (more on that later). So yeah, quite frankly, she's a b*tch.3) My siblings. I know numbers 2 and 3 are stereotypical, but in my opinion, I have the most selfish, self-centered, bratty siblings ever. At least my youngest brother is cute.4) My schedule. Most of the free time I have I have to lie about. My parents don't even know I have a Reddit account, and they would kill me if they found out (at least then I would be happy).5) My disorders. I have autism, and I'm 80% sure I have bipolar too. Autism I actually like, although it does make my social life awkward, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't lose it if I could. Bipolar on the other hand I would gladly lose. And the worst part is, nobody else knows I have it.Sorry if that was a bit weird. I just like to lay things out mechanically. You could say it's an autism superpower. So 95% of my life is hell. The other 5% of my life is when I'm at church (and I don't even consider myself a Christian). When I'm at church, I help out in children's ministry, get to see my friends (the main reason I haven't committed suicide yet, aside from me being a p*ussy, is them), play video games (yeah, my church is awesome), and just have an all around blast. Unfortunately, 5% of my life isn't enough to keep my going. I'm 12, and nearly jumped off a wall on Wensday. I don't know how long it will be until I follow through with it.P.S Thanks if you read all that.

My friends would find new friends, if they haven't already. The people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie. Everyone can just go on without me and it'll be fine.

Did I assault someone?,"I am so scared. I recently met with a woman for quick, anoymous sex. She has a partner that likes to send her out on ""adventures"" and we met in an empty parking lot for oral. The bj got a little rough for sure. She got some tongue bruising and a scrape inside her lip from her teeth. Afterward she was feeling really messed up by the roughness. She consented and never said no or changed her mind or asked me to stop. Post event her partner said she is traumatized.

A ridiculous story about our virginity.,"This is a very weird and unbelievable story, but that's because it will lack context in a way.
And that's because I have to censor a certain important detail of this story. My story is actually longer than this, so it's shortened.  I've... always dreamt of having a relationship and having sex. I dreamt of having sex every day and night.
At age 10, I already had weird fantasies and such. I was always attracted to fictional characters and dreamt of them a lot.
So at age 15, almost 16, when it was Valentinesday I got a partner. I was happy, but I had to really focus on her in my life. She... needed me, in a way. I was so busy it was so hard to love her, but I did my best.
To this day, I'd still take a bullet for her. She's so important that I choose to suffer with her. Remember that, because that'll be relevant later. Also, I'll explain what it means first.
When she can't go to a restaurant with me, I just won't go.
When I step on her feet accidentally, I step on mine.
When it's raining and I know she's outside not protected from the rain, I won't protect my self from the rain either.
It's... just things like that.
So, we didn't have sex until later in our relationship because I just wasted for the right moment. When we're both fully sexually mature, so when we're fully grown. It was only limited to me fingering her, giving her oral and me receiving oral.
It's fun, but it did miss something... I didn't think much of it, we'll have PiV sex some day. We both weren't really ready for it as it's a bit too intense for the both of us.
Doesn't matter, we'll just have other sexual contact in the mean time. Yes, I was super optimistic about it.
I was 100% sure that it would happen some day. And honestly, I'm more of a pessimist always.
I expect the worst, but I put all my optimism in this because I was excited for it.
Life went fine in a way. I had minor depressions and sometimes small mental breakdowns and such.
Sometimes I tried having sex with her, but it just couldn't work. That's when the bad evening hit...
I was  envious of others and I was seriously pissed. Life was sometimes hard for me in a way, and I've had a bit of a trauma in the past.
And I think this was the last straw in a way.
I became very depressed that evening, but I still had a lot of optimism. I've asked for advice and tried it.
That evening, she was really into it. I... failed like usual.
The problem is, my dick is too big for her. Or rather, I hate to say it because it seems like I'm blaming her body, but her vagina just happens to be really small.
I don't even have a big sized dick, I think. Not that I ever wanted a big dick anyways, for me that always seemed like an useless achievement.
That night, she really didn't like the fact that I couldn't do it. I felt ashamed and felt sad for the both of us.
She was really pushy for me to try it again, but I just wanted to sleep.
Slowly my optimism drained quickly during these months. I don't know the name of my depression, but apparently it worsens over time and we both feel it.
I also became more envious. Everytime I failed, I just had some kind of mental breakdown. I was crying so much.
During these months I also got more and more information because I've asked others. They were all nice and trying to be helpful, but their behavior towards me changed. They started insulting me because of how absolutely ridiculous this was.
They were mad at me, and they have emotionally hurt me so much. I have never felt so bad in my life.
I swear, I am still filled with hatred what they said. I depended on a guy because he tried to ''help'' me like he said, but at the end of every message he said: ''Well, I got to go now, there's an angel waiting in my bedroom.''
This his way of saying: ''I have what you don't, hahaha.'' I begged for him to stop, but I depended on him so I still tried to listen, yet he kept doing it until I blocked him.
Nobody had hurt me so much in my life. Not even my mother, who is absolutely horrible to everyone in the house.
Really, it's worse than you think it is. Everyday I think of him. I have never been so hurt by anything.
I would prefer to be stabbed or even raped. I genuinely felt suicidal because of him.
I can't take it, why do all the bad humans get the good things? I've never done anything wrong.
Trough all these months I have been trying EVERYTHING I could. Yet a whole group told me I don't even deserve it.
I am so fucking envious of him. I'd do  (but hurt my girl) to be in his situation...
There's also one thing I have to live with. My girl will die of a disease she has in a few years.
That means I will live longer than her. Even if they admitted it was gross of them to say, they told me to wait to have sex for my next partner.
But that's not even my goal. It's my goal to have sex with her, not anyone else. Even if you gave me the hottest partner, I would decline. Not even for infinite money.
I am envious of every couple I see as I know 100% they can have sex. I get pissed by every time sex gets mentioned. I get more depressed every day.
This is important, I also do this for her. This isn't just lust, I want her to experience it too. That's why I will never have sex with anyone else.
Remember this whole ''I suffer with her'' thing? If she dies a virgin, I will too. That said, when she dies... I'll end myself.
Every other couple can do this together, yet we can't. That alone may have just triggered this whole thing.
Sex is special, it's something you just don't miss in your life time. And think about it, dying a virgin is probably one of the worst things to ever happen.
You'll miss out on something that many couples do together for fun so much. We only have one life and missing this is just so sad.
Nobody deserves this fate, absolutely no one.
I really do not see her as a sex object, I love every part of her. Her personality, her body, her movements, her everything. It's just that I'm hit with these curses.
First, we can't have sex together. Second, for some reason sex is important to us, especially to me the most.
My depression is really serious. I have become aggressive and don't enjoy anything anymore. Absolutely
If you're still confused why it's so important. Sometimes, you just think something is important.
There's a lot of humans who will tell you this when your animal dies: ''It's just an animal, get a new one.'' It's kind of like this.
We all value different things. And let me remind you, it's done against our will.
I... honestly don't want to leave my girl alone in this world. But if I found a gun, the urge to end myself immediately would be great.
I really care for her, but my life feels so shit and unlucky that I can't take it anymore. I've always been paranoid and fearful, so I don't dare to kill myself in another way.
I just wish we could both have our moment just once. If we had it just once, I'll be grateful forever. That is all I want.
Surgery won't work because she doesn't want to be changed as she's afraid of it, and I myself have no idea how to even have such a surgery happen to myself.
...And one thing, I can't tell anyone about this. About everything I just said, I mean.
She isn't mentally ill as proven by the doctors here, yet it's still in the files because there was a mistake. It had something to do with her disease that'll kill her in a few years. According to a very strict law in where I live, I am not allowed to have sex with her nor be in a relationship with her.  I... am just sick of life. I just want us to have our happy little moment, that's all.
My goal is so fucking simple yet I don't get it even though I spent so much energy, optimism and time into it. Yet everyone else does it effortlessly.
I am no longer optimistic and I hate absolutely every human. I don't really want to live any more.
I just... I just wanted that one minute of easy happiness together... That is all.
Just because all of this, I have a worsening depression ruining both of our lives. It affects my whole mind.
It feels like it affects my intelligence, I lose the ability to read sometimes, even. I go crazy from time to time...
I am suicidal because of our lack of quality in our lives.  Please, let me make something sure again. I'm not a selfish fuck who's just horny.
That said, this also affected my libido. I lost the interest in sex for a while completely.
I don't even try having sex with her any more. We're beating a dead horse.
I care about her in a non-sexual way, it's just unfortunate for me that it holds so much value to me.
And if we ever had sex, I wouldn't even care if I never had sex again. I just want the experience with her  and that's it.
I want us both to experience it. She needs to enjoy it and I will.
But no... just like everything in life, luck fucks me over. Sounds edgy and kind of makes you cringe, but if luck was a human... I'd do everything to torture this piece of shit.
We don't deserve this. I was happy and optimistic once.   ",A1,0.7,"The text reflects emotional dependency and unusual behaviors in the relationship, which may warrant monitoring for potential mental health concerns. However, there is no explicit indication of immediate harm or crisis.",False,,,A1
First time I physically almost killed myself on purpose.,"Alternate title - TIFU by not ending it allI don't remember and am too lazy to check as to how much I did or did not write on my last post here about my life, and ending it all. I was scrolling through to see that I am not alone on this sub when I found someone had posted that they flipped a coin heads or tails heads they killed themselves, and they did it five times just because they were feeling so down. It landed tails each time, and they had felt like some ""supernatural being"" had been behind all of that. I am a Junior in High School, and my US Government/History (We learn a few things about when the government and the USA as a whole was established, and for the rest of the year we talk about current events/politics) course has been a major contributing factor to my wanting to end it all, and my seeing no purpose in life. He often goes off track and on the first day suggested that everything that he says is in the past technically because there is a speed that light and sound have to travel at to reach us. He said that because of this, we could each be in different universes. Obviously, I did not believe any word of what he was saying and took him for one of the many crazies over at  (not saying all of reddit's conspirators on that sub are crazies, just saying that because the one time that I went on there there was a user posting about fluoride being a concerning and dangerous chemical that the government puts in our waters). But anyway, he was talking to us one day about this book called the Law (some conservative conspiracy filled book that our grade has to read, I guess) and he was telling us that the government is an illusion and that religion is an illusion, and both of those are just here for us to do what we're told and to behave, and that if we really wanted to leave school right now, nothing is stopping us, so why shouldn't we? It really had me thinking, am I just here because my parents are guilt-tripping me into staying alive? I already had no religious belief, so that part didn't phase me. I figured some time ago that religion was a system to keep humans hoping and to keep them alive, because ""god's watching over you so you better do what you're told"", yadda yadda ya. I just figure that when we die we feel the same feeling as before we were born, and that feeling is a feeling of pure nothingness. But it really had me wondering. My dad is catholic, so he kept telling me that if I kill myself it's a one-way ticket to hell. My mom told me that I'd better not EVER kill myself, and though she does not condone me smoking marijuana, she'd rather I do that than go and kill myself. She got really sad when she heard from the guidance counselor about my plans to kill myself a few years ago (my friends ratted me out), and she dumped out my 2 methods of suicide that I had in mind. I had to come up with a new way to die, a new painless death, and I still am, to this day. 5 or 10 minutes ago, I walked into the kitchen. I took out a chef knife (the biggest one that we have in the kitchen), and held it up to my thumb to see how much damage it would do. I then held it up to my throat, and thought about sliding it. That's how close I came to death today, and looking back, I wish I just had the strength to end it all. I feel like going in to my school tomorrow and telling my guidance counselor about it, but my mom is going through so much hassle right now that she really does not need to deal with my depression and suicidal thoughts on top of what's on her plate. Another driving force that's really weighing me down are my grades. I have 2 F's but the rest are B's. The teachers and staff would not believe me if I told them that everyone hates the 2 teachers whose classes I am failing, because in the previous years I've been slacking on my education and overall I've been being careless about my future. I really don't want to fail my Junior year of High School and have to use my work money to attend summer school, but that may be what I'll have to do, sadly. I really hate those two teachers, and their classes are another one of my many driving forces to die. I've heard rumors about what happens to the people that get caught coming close to death and suicide, and it does not sound fun. I hear that the people that get caught get sent to facilities and hospitals for doctors to monitor their mental state, etc...I figure that that racks up a bunch of money on the bill for their parents to pay, and my mom is single with 4 kids (albeit 2 of which are grown up, but still). Another driving factor is the fact that my brother is doing so much better than I am. You guys probably assume that this is selfish of me, but my brother is doing so much better in school than I am, he has a girlfriend, and my parents are proud of him. It makes me feel unimportant, which, I figure, would make most of you assume that I would want to be doing more in school and getting a girlfriend to make my parents proud. And I do, it's just I physically do not have the energy. My friends call me a fatass, and I can't say that I would argue with that. Even though I have a healthy bmi, it's close to saying overweight, and that bothers me. I've tried to resort to bulimia, but I can't even make myself throw up. I've looked up ways to make myself puke, but none of them worked. I could buy ipicac, but I'm shit at hiding stuff from my family. I would buy laxatives, and tell my family that I'm trying to use them to stop gas throughout the day, but I'm afraid of taking those (don't ask me why, I wouldn't be able to tell you.)

Feeling worthless as another birthday is coming up.,"I'll first start off by saying that I do have thoughts of suicide but not thoughts of going through it, just ways of starting. With that said, I'm not in a state of mind where I'd follow through with any of the thoughts. I'd understand if this post isn't allowed for that reason. I am feeling worthless however, I'll be 25 in a few days with absolutely nothing to show for it. I've went to college for a year, trucking school for about 6-7 months, have had 2 jobs with 1 being for about 3 weeks and the other being 2 days. Bottom line is I quit everything and now it's left me trapped turning 25 with barely any experience or anything. I also have a school loan from trucking school for 3 grand. That isn't very much compared to other school loans but it sure is when you aren't making anything. The problem is that I have a mild stutter which makes interviews really difficult to get through, especially if I get nervous. For that reason I didn't even apply for a job for about 6 months due to just giving up. A few months back I said fuck all of that and started applying to places. Got a few interviews but nothing turned out. Then I got a job from a temp agency which was the job I quit in two days so now I'm right back where I started!

Because obviously your persona that annoys people isn't going to cause problems because people will accept you for who you are for some reasonThis life is pointless, after all. I don't do anything. I have no motivation, no confidence, nothing. I don't know why I manage to go on.Maybe it doesn't matter if what I'm experiencing is ""real"" or not. But then I'd have no reason to do this. Or maybe it doesn't matter to have a reason? Jesus I can never keep things consistent in my mind. Maybe this would be a good thing. Even if it would hurt everyone....What's the point in trying if I lack to strength to do whatever I want without worrying about being judged or failing.I wish I was a guy and I can't even convince myself I'm transgender because I don't experience it like most of them do. I don't have fucking gender dysphoria. I'm deluding myself. Yet I'd bother killing myself over it.Why am I so dramatic? I'm not cringing irl, I just feel...empty? is that the right word?...but if I did feel a bit more I'd be cringing.Meh.I still have some life in me. I could bother saving myself, but I don't feel like it. Now is the perfect opportunity to just...do something...about it...I act like an annoying main character in a book. I use ""I"" too much, I feel different from everyone else (and focus on it so much that I fail to see how my feelings are legitimate), and I whine too much about it. I just want people to feel bad for me. I want to show them I'm suffering, that my life sucks, that I'm really this great special person that everyone should love because I have no bad intentions yet I troll my own friends when I feel jealous...the wanting sympathy part, honestly, it's probably another reason for the impostor syndrome shit...because I AM faking it, somewhat...Maybe feeling like I'm faking it is fake too, like I'm doing THAT for attention. I know I'm posting on reddit for attention. I know I'm killing myself for attention. Everything is just a cry for help. I annoy friends (I hardly talk to them about this sort of shit anymore because I feel like I'm such a burden for them) so I go to reddit and I literally post shitty things to strangers and expect sympathy. Obviously I don't always get it. I've used multiple accounts. I've acted far too dramatic. I've basically been a stupid little bitch. Bitch doesn't even feel like a good word for me. I'm practically the opposite of a slut. I purposely make myself look ugly to rebel against the shitty way society views women: they're sex toys with thin revealing clothing with too much makeup and they have to shave in places where men don't have to. Fuck that.I need to end it. I don't want to keep going in circles. I just want to forget about everything and not have to be reminded by my own brain about all the crappy things I've done, the shitty event in my life which might be considered traumatic as I ironically feel a lot worse over it than the day my mom died, but it's all self-inflicted. But no one will fucking get it. And if I dare talk about it, my identity is at risk of being exposed, even though I wasn't that popular..I'm not really suicidal I'm just selfishWho gives a shitI mean I'm depressed, right? But I haven't even seen a therapist so how the fuck do I know if part of that isn't made up tooWait why am I calling part of it real...probably because I know I have something...it's just not legit anymore...I don't know if I'll actually do it. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Like most times where I didn't, I felt too shitty and lazy to do homework, and I'll fail my math test tomorrow, and I don't know...I don't want to see the light anymore and convince myself not to die...isn't that wonderful? Not really. But it sounds incredibly stupid...like, again, I'm making this all up, because I LIKE feeling the pain, otherwise I would've taken steps to improve my mood...like getting enough sleep and eating healthily and shit..I'm not suicidal why am I doing thisFuck everythingI may or may not do this maybe I'll just chicken out because I'm a loser I don't knowI think reincarnation exists though so maybe I'll be able to try againI hope I won't fuck it upMy name is Victoria and I'm a confused selfish dramatic loser.

On a Merry go round (Pet Stuff),"So, I really don't know what to expect from this. I have nowhere to turn and no one to talk to. Maybe it will help to just get the thoughts out there. My dog is sick, I adopted him and he was the runt. He's not even a year old yet. I'm doing everything I can to get him to a vet but my funds are very limited as I am sick myself. This has happened to me before with a previous dog, she was only 4 and at the time I had no money. I begged, cried till my lungs were on fire, and pleaded to my then boyfriend to please help her that there was something seriously wrong. He didn't believe me, called my a hypochondriac and said he had no money. I had called around to different vets and it was going to be 60 some dollars to help her and she would have been fine. He said he couldn't afford it. She died a few days later while I was sleeping. He was sitting right next to her and he didn't do anything, didn't wake me up, he did nothing. She died alone. Come to find out he had over a grand in the bank and he had zero bills to pay for. And now I feel like the same issue is happening all over again. I don't have much but what I do have I'm going to do everything I can to help him but the vet I'm having to take him to can't see him till Friday. If he dies I'm going to end my life. I feel like such a shitty mother. I couldn't take care of one of the things I loved most in this world and here I am maybe about to lose another.

I come from a very abusive home, have been treated like trash and abused by ex's and I feel like my two dogs are the only things in the world who have loved me. I couldn't fail another one and be able to live with myself for letting him die. The best thing I can think of if this does happen is just to not let him die alone.

Tomorrow might be the day.,"I'm not 100% yet but I think tomorrow is when I'll do it. I stayed home from school today because I just couldn't bring my self to go to school and do my work like everything is okay. Tomorrow I'll go. I'll dress cute, look pretty for my final day. Make sure to hug all the friends I care about for a final goodbye. When I get home I'll need to write several letters to important family members and certain people in my life. If you're wondering why I'm going to kill myself I guess I'll tell you why. My life was a mess. I was doing lots of shit I shouldn't do. Drugs, sleeping around, not respecting myself because I was depressed (I have diagnosed depression, it runs in the fam woohoo). But then something changed. My dad gave me the option to stay where we were or move to a new state because he had gotten a job offer. Even though I liked my life at the time because I had a few friends and would party every weekend, something inside me told me to move on. So I did. I came to where I currently live and my life changed so much for the better. I had a new, better reputation. People liked me (well a lot of girls were still bitchy that's never changed) and I met someone. I met him. Everything about him was perfect and we instantly clicked. Best friends and lovers. He knew everything about my past and the low things I had done and he loved me anyways. I knew everything about him too. I've never had such an honest and open loving relationship with someone. He really was the one, as dumb as that may sound to u.
Well this summer something changed and we had a huge fight over something he had done (not cheating). I was so mad at him and even though I forgave him, for months afterward I acted childish. Always mad over small things. Always being too overprotective of him. We had both always been overprotective of eachother but since then I took it to the extreme. And I knew I wasn't behaving the right way. But at the time I didn't give a shit. Because I was still mad at him. But that doesn't mean I didn't love him. I love him more than anything. And we still had tons of happy times but I guess the bad times canceled those out. And I guess Im an idiot because I ignored him when he warned me he wasn't happy like this. And then last weekend was the breaking point. He came back from a trip and told me he wanted to break up. He was serious. I fought for him and begged him and told him I really would change the way I'd been acting. Finally he agreed that while I went out of town the following weekend we'd have a mini break. He promised to keep an open mind and also stay loyal to me of course. Some time away from eachother. So we didn't call and barely texted and it was the hardest thing ever. Someone who's been in your life constantly for so long.
Well. Yesterday I flew back. And I had lost hope over the weekend but I didn't let myself feel the pain. I told myself not to worry because in 2 days I can just take the pain away. Forever. Well yesterday I did something foolish. I let hope creep back in. I had hope he would listen to me and believe me I'd change. He didn't. He's heard it before. But I meant it this time I did. Bc losing him was at stake. I tried everything and I spoke to him from my heart and he didn't care. He wouldn't do it. And I'm devastated.
I'm so mad at myself for taking him for granted. I love him and I'm so sorry. I wish I could go back in time to take it all back. And at this point I don't care anymore. I don't want to move on. I can't imagine seeing him with anyone else. I can't imagine myself talking to anyone else.
So. Tomorrow's the day I think. I just have to pick a sure method. Either Gabapentin od, slicing my wrists (or a combo of both for sure outcome) or jumping off a cliff/building.

Then it all changed. My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless. Now I'm Secondary 3(15), today I'm accused of being a stalker, I'm getting blocked, and time is running out. My murderous mind is going crazy, I nearly leapt today. Close friend stopped me. One day I'm gonna be outta friends. That is when I know I'm a definite goner. Please. Help me for god's sake.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates severe distress, thoughts of self-harm and harm to others, feelings of hopelessness, and a history of abuse and bullying.

My OCD is making me want to die.,"Existing is so exhausting, everything needs to be done over and over and over again. Stand up go and wash my hands, pet the dog wash my hands. Before I put on clothes I have to shake them and make sure they are clean, I dont get to just do anything, everything has to have a procedure before it. I just want to be normal. Im tired of worrying about everything, Im tired of everything hurting. I just want it to stop.",A2,0.85,"The text expresses significant emotional distress, exhaustion, and frustration with compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. While there is no explicit mention of immediate harm or crisis, the level of distress suggests the need for intervention to provide support and address these challenges.",False,,,A2
"Thinking about it, ALOT.","so, ever since my brother moved out i've been stuck here. im 29, no job, no money, no nothing. stuck at home, can't get a job because i can't go anywhere because i have no car and live miles from anything. every day i wake up and think ""is today the day?"" and ever night before i fall asleep (when i can sleep) i wonder why i didn't do it. i'm 50/50 on wanting to do but not wanting to destroy my mom by doing it. she would never be the same if i did. but at the same time i can't take it anymore. my brother was always kind of my best friend, now he won't even pick up the fucking phone when i call him literally seconds after getting a text from him (just happened as i was typing this) so he definitely has the phone in his hand still. i'm not even going to tell him about if he wants to be so selfish.  fuck this, typing it out just makes me want to do it more. i think i want to do it tomorrow. i already have everything i need, and i have options. i could go with drugs, a gun, hanging, whatever i just don't fucking care anymore.

There's nothing left for me.,"I feel like the only thing I have left to do is to just end, it I'm sick of fighting this shit. I screw up every relationship and job I get. I can't do it anymore suicide is the one thing that I actually look forward to anymore because it's the only thing that's guaranteed, it's the only way to be sure I won't be miserable anymore. I'm a fucking piece of shit and it's better if I'm gone. I can't even buy a damn gun because I've been committed to a mental hospital. I feel like in stuck here and I don't want to be anymore. I don't want time to realize what I'm doing I just want to be gone like turning off a light switch.",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2
