"Friend has given up, seriously considering suicide","I have a friend who has given up. She's been in abusive relationships, self-harmed, had serious body issues her whole life. A few months ago she was spiked and raped.

I want the sadness to end,"Hello, So, I'm a 17 year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately.For the past 2 years, I've felt depressed almost all of the time. I can't pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way. While I've never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything, both of my parents have, so I believe it's not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something.Some stretches of time have felt harder than others. This past week is one of those times. I've had trouble getting to sleep, I've woken up late or early every day, I've had trouble focusing, I don't feel engaged in anything I do, I can't get myself to do any school work, and I've cried for at least half an hour every day.The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts. I've unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways. The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating. I don't think I have the nerve to act on them, but I worry sometimes.I've been taking medication (generic Lexapro) every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week. Both of these have a positive impact for sure, but I don't know that they're enough. I still feel hopeless sometimes, like my life isn't worth living. I feel miserable.The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself. I feel like those who would notice wouldn't care all that much. My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house. My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously. One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best. The other is a real sweet heart, but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me. That got to me. All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year. The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about 9 months, and won't return home for about 9 more. I don't know if I can last that long. I miss her so much.I honestly feel like I want to die right now. I want the sadness to stop. I can't handle it. I feel worthless right now.Sorry if it seems like I'm just seeking attention, but I'm hoping getting this off my chest will help. Any advice, support, comments, etc. are appreciated a lot.",A3,0.95,"The individual is experiencing suicidal thoughts, visualizing self-harm, and expressing significant distress despite ongoing medication and counseling.

Love is the best of things and the worst of things,"I'm 26, soon to be 27 on the 2nd of October, and about two months ago my fiancee broke up with me. I've been here before and told people my troubles (you can go through my post history to get the full details) but it just seems to be getting worse. I feel really numb and lost without her. She was everything to me. Apparently she's got PTSD after what I did. I have depression and I beat her several times. I never meant to hurt her, I just lost control and made some stupid mistakes. I regret what I've done everyday. But it feels like she never cared about me because she put a post on facebook telling everyone what I've done when we broke up and her friend is now harassing me. It's really pushing me over the edge. I've tried to kill myself three times but I'm that pathetic I've failed at it. I want her back so much. I love her dearly. I don't want to hurt her or my family but I'm tired of being in pain.  I don't want to kill myself and put her in the same position she put me in. One where she wakes up everyday regretting the choices she's made. I don't want her to feel guilty or to regret dumping me but I don't wanna be in pain anymore. I have my first counselling session on the 27th, but I've stopped taking my anti-depressants and I'm drinking nearly every night. I quit my job, spend all day in bed researching ways to kill myself. I made a deal with myself that if she doesn't wish me a happy birthday I'll just end it on the night. If she can't do that one thing then I know she doesn't care and I might as well be dead. I love her to pieces and I wish it didn't have to be this way.

"I'm scared, confused and I want to die.","I hate myself.
I'm a fat, stupid, worthless, piece of trash disgrace. I know for a fact the people around me would be so much better off without me. I find myself crying in secret everyday and hiding my tears under the blanket at night as I feel empty and lonely surrounded by the darkness.
It feels like I never have and I never will fit in.

Is there someone I can talk to? Please!,"It's 2:00 am GMT in the morning in Southeast Asia. I've been crying for 3 hours straight. I hate my parents so much, I want to take 20 sleeping pills I've bought and die. It's a long story. I think every parents in this world fuck their kids up in a way they would never know. They are divorced  for 10 years now. My father is a selfish man, retired now, all he wants now is just money and alcohol. My mother is a rich woman, who can donate thousand dollars to homeless people but to her kids, no.

I sincerely feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001... seriously.,"One night I decided it was time to die. I've never fit in anywhere, and I've always been a ghost. I never had a friend and I'm not exaggerating. Throughout middle school and high school I kept to myself and I always was an outcast for reasons unbeknownst to me. One night I grew tired of it all and I decided to end my life in 2001. I bought a bundle of heroin, some Klonopin to calm my nerves, and 1.5L of vodka. After downing a significant amount of Vodka and taking the Klonopin, I decided it was time. I injected a lethal dose of heroin - that I'm absolutely sure of. I was also alone -as was usual- so there was no one to save me. I passed out into oblivion. For a brief moment I experienced pure nirvana and peace... I accepted myself for what I was and it was beautiful. I no longer felt the need to connect with others and I was all right with being alone for eternity. Here's where things get strange: The next thing I recall is being put into an ambulance but not in a literal or physical way. I saw it as if I was above myself. I saw the EMT working on me and I recall my family looking on from the window of the ambulance (yes... the stereotypical out-of-body experience and I'm not even religious) . As bizarre as it sounds, I was able to see and experience every emotion of it all. I experienced the sadness of my family, the panic (or perhaps more accurately the intense concentration) of the EMTs because I had no vitals, and the determined nature of the driver to get me to the ER as soon as possible. If I agree with the the story told to me by my family, I was forced into coma for several days in order to let the drugs seep out of my body. When I awoke,  I immediately claimed I was dead and yet my family insisted I wasn't. I had to spend an additional day in the hospital and I NEVER saw a nurse or anyone but my mother. The hospital was quiet and this, in itself, was strange. To anyone who has been in a hospital, there is always a bunch of noise and a nurse routinely checks in on you. Anyhow, the only person I saw during the night was my mother who stayed oddly quiet. The next day I was released and things and people seemed... odd.My opinion is that I died and I don't use this term loosely. I sincerely feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. Sixteen years later I find that I am still a ghost, only more so. When I'm cutting grass and wave to my neighbors, they don't wave back. I also haven't left my house in sixteen years. After I died (or so I believe), I also came across a mysterious amount of money that has let me become a recluse. Let me rephrase that: I was able to buy a new house in cash -but I grew up insanely poor so this makes no sense- and now I'm kept inside a house that is completely alien to me. I must admit, this all seems too convenient and very bizarre. I can't help but feel I actually died and this may very well be the afterlife. Anyone else in this situation? I haven't ruled out the possibility I have just lost my mind, but I'm absolutely certain everything I have said is true when it comes to the important facts. I even have the hospital receipts to prove it to a point, as well as the mortgage info. The only factor that remains debatable is whether I was actually saved or not. The thing is, the events that transpired in me being saved make absolutely no sense. I was absolutely certain to make sure I would die that night and my family wasn't around to help me. However, my brother claims he randomly stumbled across me and saw that I wasn't breathing which is completely out of character (he wasn't even near the area I OD'd in). It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel my psyche is some how attempting to cope with my death. Even more disturbing is the events after the attempt, my father suddenly claimed he forgot about a pension and then gave me enough money to buy a home and live in absolute seclusion. I grew up INSANELY poor and prior to my suicide I struggled to find food and merely survive. Now he suddenly comes across a TON of money I'm living a comfortable life in absolute seclusion. To sum it up: After I ""attempted"" suicide the events that transpired make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. The depressing shit is I'm not happy and I routinely find myself considering suicide. While I'm now in a good home and living comfortably, my families health is quickly deteriorating. Its as if I'm being forced to witness my only remaining connection to this world die off and its absolutely terrifying.Needless to say, I can't help but wonder whether I'm losing my mind. Regardless, I find myself routinely contemplating suicide to test the theory that I'm already dead. Anyhow, I realize this post may sound absurd and I totally understand if its deleted for being off-topic or outright ignored (the latter of which will make sense).",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2
Lost and Hopeless,"At what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option? I've had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now, but I never really considered actually doing it until quite recently. I'm so far down the drain that I don't think it's humanly possible to obtain the life I want, a somewhat normal life, anymore.I'm a 23 year old guy with avoidant personality disorder who doesn't have any friends, never worked a job, and never had any sort of relationship with anyone. On top of that, I just failed college for the second time in 5 years because I'm too depressed and anxious to deal with handling the work and being around people all day. I have absolutely no skills or anything to offer to any individuals or society. I just play video games and listen to music all day because that's the only thing that doesn't cause me anxiety.I hate myself and I hate the fact that I hate myself. I can see the innate beauty in every other person on this planet except for myself. A lot of people feel and act the way I do and I wouldn't call them worthless, so why must I do so when it comes to me? I feel this hollow yet dense pain in my chest that won't go away. The pain comes from the realization that I am completely and utterly worthless, and nothing will ever change that because I was born with the wrong genes and made stupid decisions my entire life.Medications, therapies, and ""getting out there"" haven't helped in the slightest. In all honesty, I'm worse off for having tried them because I used to have hope that there was something out there that could help me. Failing over and over again has crushed my soul to the point of no return.

Feeling like everyone would be happier without me,"Long story short, my girlfriend of the last 3 years just up and randomly left me without so much as a reason (which is okay, that's just life; doesn't really matter because it still hurts), but what really hit hard was her saying ""yes"" when I asked her if she'd be happier if I was dead.

Long story short been battling depression for years now, which I'm sure some of you know is a living hell in itself. I've been down to the point of having the classic place and time and method to end it all but brought myself to not go through with it. Last night it got to me really badly, I almost ended up doing it. I went online and went to the suicide hotline's online chat, well I was 18th in line so I turned on some music, and between the 2 hour wait and pandora changing the music from gloomy to more upbeat it helped out. When I get to thinking like that its kinda like two parts of my brain, or two me's are thinking different things.One side is saying do it, one side is telling me not to and being rational. Its hard to describe because its so odd to me that my mind is kinda like having 2 different thought processes at the same time but both are so clear and defined. Today isn't much better so far, and its just getting too tiring to combat anymore. I've debated about going to the E.R last night and if it gets that bad tonight again I might but honestly, I'm scared of whats going to happen...

I'm starting to doubt that it gets better...,"I'm 22. My life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew. I can't remember most of my childhood because I was raped my a priest when I was in fourth grade. I can't really remember much of anything about my life. Even shit that happened fairly recently. I can't maintain normal relationships. First one ended in me being stalked for five years. Second one was just me being used. Third/fourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth (no, it hasn't come back a year and a half later), and seriously contemplating death. This is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety. And then  I got kicked out on short notice.Fifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together. After two months of not talking I started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing. I kind of hate myself for it, but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because it's really hard for me to meet and approach new people. My only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority. These people also think I'm a fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me. I don't really blame them.I got bullied a lot k-12. I understand why. I'm generally strange and aggravating to be around. I've worked on it a lot, so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours. After high school I took a gap year in Germany. That was a mistake. I was pretty lonely and just drank a lot. And then I started blacking out (turns out PTSD from being raped as a child can cause that), and my family basically told me I was on my own and that they didn't want to deal with me coming back at the moment (at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought I was having seizures).College sucked. I chose poorly and wasn't ready. I did a year. I'm still on leave. I know I'll never be able to afford to go back. I'm not sure that I want to. Up until Thursday I didn't think I would have to. Because this summer, after all of the bullshit, the shit jobs, the loneliness, and everything else, I managed to actually get the job I really wanted. And then I went and somehow found a way to fuck it up. Actually no, that's a lie. I know exactly how I fucked it up. By being myself.I'm not sure what's left at this point. My entire life has been about making it to the next place because that won't suck, right? Only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard I try. I don't have dreams for the future anymore. When people ask me where I seem myself in ten years I'm completely lost because I can't imagine even being alive in ten years. It's not that I plan on being dead, it's that I don't see how I'm going to make it. I'm just tired. I want to stop. I've been pushing for what feels like my entire life now, and I just want a break.

I just... am lost... gonna end it today,"(i am not going to use caps in this, sorry ya grammar nazis) hi. i never thought it would come to asking the internet for help... but here i am. i have considered suicide since a young age. i always pushed past those ""phases"". but lately... i am just having doubts. doubts i will ever be accepted or love. i have been putting on a facade for years, no one around me really knows how i feel. how ever night i pull out my moms pills to hold in my hands for hours, how i take ""late walks"" to the bridge and look over it. it is almost comforting, thinking about dropping my worries. let me explain, i guess. i am still not an adult, but not young enough to have no expectations. i am a junior in highschool. lately, my mom and dad have been going at it again. from a young age, my dad has been addicted to meth. he would stand in my moms face and call her... unspeakable things. he would stand in the living room with a knife to his neck demanding money. he would get it and just leave... like nothing happened. my mom, also suffers from extreme depression. she had quit her job at one point in the summer and laid in bed naked for 4 days. during those days, i watched and cared for all my siblings. 3 brothers, two of which have autism (schizophrenia and aspergers, some other smaller mental disorders that caused the oldest to become easily attached to things). and 1 sister (the youngest hadn't been born till a year and a half after). my older brother (my only older sibling) was abusive. he would threaten to gut me and chase me with knives, he constantly beat me, and i couldnt fight back. not because i wasn't strong enough, but because i couldn't bring myself to hurt him. anyways, those days of no adults and me stepping up to plate have really affected me. lately i have had nightmares of those days, and how hopeless i felt. i had no one to tuck me in, my mom, bless her heart, had always been there. i was mortified of being alone. after that, things got worst. one night, not to long after my dad came back, he was, angry. the house wasn't clean and my mom still lied in bed. he proceded to, hurt her and threaten us. i remember grabbing a knife and rushing to grab my siblings. but he, hit me hard. i had never been so terrified. from that point on my mom and dad have been at each others necks. he still to this day is addicted to meth, and my mom still speaks of killing herself. i am a relatively popular person, i have friends, and i actually like that. they are the only thing keeping me afloat. i, like other people got into bad eating habits at a young age. years of mom going to mcdonalds every night for dinner conditioned my body for the future junk food. it became my comfort. after elementary, middle school was... awful. i grew up in a city called omaha, some might know it. but it is a very... bad city. at least where i lived: north omaha. i was ridiculed for being fat. i also developed love for... well men. i was called fag and beat up, constantly. i had always been ""bullied"" whether for being poor, fat, or ""fugly"". i was mortified. for two years, one thing i said haunted me and caused all my friends to leave me and become my enemies, the day i said ""i am gay"". you might be think ""you cant decide your sexuality at that age"" but in north omaha, everyone was already losing their virginity by seventh grade. i just didn't feel attracted to girls. i had one friend to get me through, the one person i never told, even to this day, my cousin. me and my cousin, like most family grew less close over the years, he moved constantly, and his mom, who was in the army, was stationed in germany. i lose my best friend, and was all alone till high school. then we finally moved, i wont say where, because i am still living there, but it was further into iowa. i was able to be myself and have friends, i was ecstatic, i was finally happy. but... but things change i guess. i just have grown hopeless, i notice the looks of disgust i get from my ""friends"", i am not very good looking, obviously. i have lose some weight over the years, like 30 pounds or so, and i thought i was happy with myself. but recently, i was just going to school and someone called me fag. i, i was confused and, i... i... thought that almost adults would be accepting, or at least tolerant of me. but, i guess that is hopeless too. i am so tired, of the looks i get, of the people around me changing, about my family, about how now when i look in the mirror all i see are flaws. no matter how hard i try, no matter what i do, no matter how much i pray to god to be merciful. the blows keep coming, they don't stop. i never have been happy, i sit and nod my head smiling when my friends talk to me, smile whenever people catch me frowning. i just can't go on living lies, i know i am not happy, i know i am ugly and fat and stupid. i am just lying thinking, about how i could end it. i don't want my family to wake up to a dead body, i cannot imagine that. even if i don't always like them, i love my family. i don't want them to think this is completely their fault. i am gonna throw myself in the missouri river tomorrow night. i just want to not feel anything anymore, i don't want to worry about college, or stopping my parents from hitting each other, or worrying about how i look, or keep thinking about how my life is going to be just like my dad's: a drug addict who beats his wife. i hate it. i hate crying. but i am crying right now. i just cant. but the thing is i am scared. i dont want to die. i just want to... start over. every bad thing in my life could've been solved, i could've called cps, i could've not come out, i could have worked out and eaten right, i could have helped more people, done more for others. i know there are other people suffering, and people way worse off, but right now, that isn't enough to stop me. i am a self loathing, attention whore, i know. and posting here is just going to justify that. but before i do end it. i just want to... laugh. i want to feel warmth again. i know i sound ""emo"" but, i just miss getting hugs and sleeping by my mom and dad. i miss the days when school was fun and i wasn't worrying about everyone judging me, and about how well i am doing. i hate it, i hate... myself. i just want to see my grandma again. all those days i spent scrapbooking and cooking with her are my best memories, but she is gone and no one in the world gives a shit. so if i disappear, will anyone really care? and no, i know everyone will be sad for like a few weeks, and yatta yatta. but in a year, no one will remember who i was. the art i did, the songs i sang, the games i played will be boxes thrown in the attic, everyone will forget. for the best of course, i am not sad, i just think that the life i am living isn't mine anymore. i am hurt, my family, my ""friends"", myself, they left me broken, and i glued myself back together with religion and games and music and school, but now, the glue has come undone. i just don't care anymore. i cannot put on those smiles anymore, i can't belt out notes anymore, i can't make art anymore. i cant do anything right. i am a peice of shit. this world would be better off without me, some whiny fag... thanks for reading my life. i will be done. i am sorry for being me. i know i am

I love being myself but it seems like nobody else likes it when I am.

At 14 I had a man of 26 interested in me that makes him a pedophile. Then at 17 I had sex with a man of 26 it was wrong and I feel suicidal about it. Then I was taken advantage off in my teen years, then at 22 I was sexually assaulted by a photographer. Not only did he assault me multiple times but he completely ruined my life. I did beautiful modelling work and never wanted to model again. When I was 18 I fell in love with with a man five years older than me and I had never experienced anything like it. We were madly in love and he taught me so much. We smoked weed together and i was already sick from a young age with borderline personality disorders but the weed made me think. It made me think about the world and that we live in a sick twisted world and everyone is sick and evil and I know that my experiences have shaped my beliefs about the world but I truly believe we are over run with evil. That we live on a hell planet. One day after all this and more had happened to me, I was smoking weed and I started hearing a voice, it told me to smoke the weed more and to watch the smoke in the chamber. I thought it was some kind d of spiritual awakening and my third eye had been opened and I was able to access the spiritual world. I still believe that to this day. That this world is not what we think and it could be a world that is so much more beautiful than we can imagine. I started to believe that there was a god and my voices were guiding to become more and more spiritually enlightened. They told me all kind of things. They took me on a journey. They told me to look up a documentary called war dance and I had never heard of it before and it's about the children in Uganda who were forced to murder their parents. I did everything the voice said, or voices, I couldn't tell if it was one or not, told me to do. They told me to get all my slutty underwear and put them all on then it told me that each one represented a sex slave and to throw them in the river. It told me more and it revealed to me what I was like and I don't think it thought I was a good person in a lot of ways. I was told what it was like like to be homeless, I was told to look at the stars and I saw the southern cross over and over again in the same spot. One day I came back to my boyfriend's place and there was always weed there and they told me to smoke the weed again and after that they told me to clean the place which was an absolute pig sty because I had been taken away to hospital, pinned down by 7 men over and over again while I was screaming and begging them not to drug me, that I didn't need drugs that I was on a spiritual awakening and I needed to see these voices or the teacher plant weed through. That the weed and my experiences was teaching me what kind of planet we are really living on and it's full of sickness. So the place was a mess and I cleaned it for hours. My boyfriend was always working and never took care of the home like I did. The voices were helping me they were waking my mind up like ayahausca does. One day the voices told me to open up my gates and let my husky off the lead the voices talked about freedom and that my husky belonged to the universe not me. They told me to follow her into the streets and told me to say come and she came back to me, when she came back to me I was so thankful that she had but then the voices told me to let her go again they were teaching how to train her. I'm a dog trainer by trade and she was already well trained and she loved me dearly. My husky had come from a couple who owned her and I had been training her. I would walk her three times a week and I would take her into the Australian Bush and let her run off lead for hours we walked and ran for hours free in nature like she should be. Like all animals deserve to be. She would follow me everywhere then I would drop her home. One night I was sitting in my garage with my boyfriend, as we live in a small garage where my boyfriend build the bed so it was on the ceiling so we had more space as he is very intelligent, and here was Harley at my door. She had escaped from her owners house and had come to find me so we spent an hour with her before returning her home. After a week or so I got a call from her owners and they said we want you to have Harley because she sits at the gate and howls all night for you. So we took her and she became my dog. She was under socialsed as a puppy and I made her into my little dog training side kick. We went everywhere together I even stopped seeing my friends and my boyfriend and my dog became my life. She helped me train other dogs and came on all the dog walks I did with me. She was my angel and I was doing angel work. I was helping people and she was helping me. I was setting these animals free and giving them a better life and they loved me like I loved them. So I set Harley free like the voices told me to and I got upset because the voices started telling me to walk to the city barefoot to prove my love to my love like the spiritual girl I was but somebody called the pound and I was crying on the floor because I didn't want to go to the city barefoot and they came and took my dog away and took me into hospital. There were signs during my spiritual trip... Like numbers, the voices led me to a house number 69 and they had been telling me to do 69 with my partner as it's equal and beautiful . And we can both get high naturally off oral sex because he used to do it to me all the time and make my mind run wild. The hyper priming that went on in my brain while I was getting oral sex was incredible. I can't think of another sign ATM. Anyway they took my dog away and put her in the pound they said they were going to kill her because she killed a cat but in hospital I prayed for days and for hours and hours on my knees praying to God because the voices told me to and my dad manage to get her sent to a large property in the northern territory to be a pest control dog because there are no dangerous dog laws in the northern territory. God answered my prayers. He saved her through my dad. When I was hearing voices my boyfriend had been ignoring me. It all started after I got back from visiting my mum in the UK I was a lonely person but I had my dog and my boyfriend. There is so much more to the story but I can't tell it all just yet I have thought about writing a book but I'm still dealing with everything that has happened to me. So I was all alone in hospital with the pound trying to kill my dog, my boyfriend who I loved so deeply that I would die for him was ignoring me because he just thought I was sick and couldn't cope with it plus I had set Harley free and he blamed me for losing her and was really really upset about everything because he loved me so deeply. I called him so much that the nurses called me stalkerish but they don't know true love like I do. That we are all slaves to money. Slaves on this planet like my boyfriend had to slave his life away to support us and I never got to see the love of my life in this one lifetime that I get on this planet. I was too Ill to work full-time and we were living in a garage so needed the money. Unless we became completely off the grid like we had planned on doing. It all fell apart I lost my dog, my job when they locked me away, my sanity when they injected me with drugs against my will. These drugs they give you are bad for your soul and your brain and made me feel incredibly ill and stiff and I couldn't shower properly I couldn't move, I couldn't talk properly and they never made the voice go away, the plant that was speaking to me or the God or whatever it was that was speaking to me no amount of drugs made it go away. Then I ran away to England I lost everything and I was so sad so so sad. And I ran to england. I got a flight assesment done and they said I was ok to travel after a month in hospital the voices stopped and they said I could fly to England. So I ran away from the drugs because my doctor said I had to be on the injection for a year but when I got to England, my mum, nan and grandad made me go to the doctor's and made me take my medication which did nothing but make me sick and the doctor said I was far too over medicated and took me off the injections. She still thinks I'm talking the pills but I'm not I haven't told anyone. They block dopamine receptors in your brain and make your brain produce more receptors to compensate when having an over reactive dopamine system is what they think causes schizophrenia in the first place. So the drugs just cause you to have an even more over reactive dopamine system. Not only this but the drugs reduce grey matter in your brain and cause Parkinson's like symptoms. I have not heard the voice again for the month that I have been here except for one hour one night. I have been having terrible nightmares. Nightmares where I have a hole in my stomach and my insides are falling out of it, I was looking at my heart pounding on the ground and my body was made of dead fish. It was strange I've never had a dream like it but I think dreams are spiritual things trying to tell us something. So after all this I have been having thoughts of throwing myself off the cliffs that I live on because I don't see myself ever being happy again. I lost the two loves of my life and I will never see my angel dog again. My spirit animal. And I just can't deal with that. It would probably be better if I my boyfriend hadn't left me before I came to England. The reason I left was because they were going to drug me for a year and my boyfriend broke up with me. I'm just so miserable I think the world is sick and evil and I keep having suicidal thoughts for good reason and I can't take drugs just to pretend that I don't feel this way when it's a completely valid way to feel. I want to die. Part of me doesn't but part of me does and im just so sad. I'm hurting so bad my heart aches and stomach aches and my head hurts and I cry and I stay strong and pretend I can cope but just sometimes I think of throwing myself of a cliff and how much better it would be. Can anyone help me I don't have any friends except my nans dogs and my best friend who is in Australia. I missed a couple of things that happened to me. When I was hearing voices I was told to run through my boyfriend's parents house naked which I did they had all godly ornaments all over the house and the voices told me that it wasn't God and they weren't really truly spiritual people. I ran through the house and into the drive way and they told me to dance in the street like I danced in the strip club and told me if I thought I was so beautiful why I couldn't I dance naked in the street. Another time was I followed my boyfriend to work on the train and the voices told me to do lots of things and I filled him an hour into the city he kept telling me to go home and I just kept following him listening to every little instruction they game me word for word. I went into the city and he went inside the building and I broke into his work and called his name but he ignored me as he was on a call. I left after that and went back to the train station and the voices told me to jump in front of a train but I didn't listen to they then told me tell out that I was being told by my voices to jump in front of a train and two people started following me and they called the police and I was taken to hospital again for more trauma. After I wrote this post I dreamt that I was in a tunnel behind a man on a scooter and I couldn't get past him o started to suffocate on the fumes and in the end I got out of the tunnel and could breathe.

I'm feeling ill and it's getting worse for each day,"Hi, I guess... I don't know how to do this. I posted in depression but maybe I should've posted here...?I've been depressed for nearly 6 years now, and you know it has been worse (suicidal) and slightly better. There was a time for a couple months I thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again. And I can't realy blame myself, I wasn't worth enough to have such feelings. I don't think I ever was.So I guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it. And one of my firends when we were out at a pub, he's been my friend for like 12 years now, he said about my father ""I can understand why he remaried with someone with children, cause he knew he'd fucked up with you and wanted to try/start over again"". And I guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and I infront of the TV or computer. Though my mother wasn't that good either she put me infront of a book (good, made me scary litterate as a kid) but she always had a bad temper. Like a hellish scream I never heard before. And she's very controlling. So that wasn't that great either. Both had to work alot to get things going for them so I guess I didn't really spend that much quality time with my family. So I waited for my time to leave and then moved out, and today I try to never visit home because I always feel bad when I'm there.And I have been kinda suicidal lately. I remember someone asked me if I was ok and only slept bad. I kinda then proceeded to do as I always do and push those asking away. I don't want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how I feel but I think it's not right. I think I will try and talk with her about something but I don't know how to ask...How should I bring it up that I want to talk about something? Should I do that? Won't they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing? Worse than to be surprised than me taking my life, and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything. Is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts? Especially since you meet them and word could spread?I wish I could cry in front of someone and be hugged. I wish I could talk to my friend and tell her how I feel and that I need someone to talk to, but I'm not quite sure she could take it or help me. Is it ok to talk to someone? Is it ok to share what I feel like, looking for some sort of comfort? Can I find comfort in this by talking or will I just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again, can I risk talking to anyone about this? Is it right of me to press something on someone, is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what I am feeling and my suicidal thoughts?",A1,0.8,"The individual expresses long-term depression and reflects on past trauma, but there is no immediate indication of crisis or active suicidal ideation.

Nothing makes things better,"I am 26 years old jobless guy who didn't finish his master's degree. Ironically I actually completed more credits than required but I got C grades or lower in 4 subject. As a result of universities policy I was dismissed without the Masters degree. Because I don't have the degree I can't find a job as I'm in a foreign country. So I just stopped caring about career, working etc and haven't worked in like 2 years. I skated by, borrowing money from friends and while I paid most of it back, I still got a lot of debt. So I stopped talking to people at all and stopped going outside or pretty much doing anything, just get up do stuff on laptop eat go to sleep. And now I'm absolutely hopelessly unable to pay rent or even buy food. My mom and dad fight all the time and dad has mentally emotionally even physically abused us for years.

Fresher's Week at University is killing me. Absolutely killing me.,"For those who don't know, Fresher's Week is the first week or two weeks at university here in the UK. Lots of parties and events take place during the week or weeks, and lots of people end up meeting each other or forming relationships. I wish I could say that I either hate or love it, but I can't give a solid answer. On the one hand, meeting lots of new people and going to clubs and getting drunk for the first time in my life feels good, and takes away most of my sorrows and defensiveness. But on the other hand, things get much, much worse when I realise what is really going on in those events, and how much of a failure I am.There are lots of issues that I have so far, but one of the main ones is, you guessed it, virginity and girls. Many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during Fresher's week is the romance, or getting with someone. Whether it's a simple dance, making out, or actually bringing them back for a one night stand, many students have done something with either the opposite or the same sex, sometimes both, during this week or weeks, and that's one of the main causes of awkward situations when you meet that someone you ""did it with"".I hate it. I hate being a virgin, even as young as 18. I hate seeing all these girls and boys, whether they are already in a relationship or just met, making out with each other or even kissing once or twice. I hate having to make things awkward when I talk to girls, or things not going further than just a short conversation (though I fully respect consent and if they simply don't want to go any further). I hate having to constantly be on the defensive in case they have a boyfriend or guy with them who will attack anyone who so much as talks to them in a wrong way. I hate having to end up losing my friends to the crowd in the centre of the club which I learned the hard way I don't survive in. I hate so much more of what goes on there.But I can't leave it.I can't leave it because I know I will achieve nothing of the sorts should I try and seek out ways other than going to a nightclub. I'm not looking for a girlfriend at the moment. It's fresher's week for fuck's sake; you're not meant to be forming relationships already because they won't last (and please don't emphasise on this point; it's trivial). Every single night, every single minute of me being in there not being able to do what the other guys who got girls are doing is torture. It's the worst I have ever felt in my five years of wanting to get a girl, possibly the worst in my life. Me being suicidal at 11 was nothing compared to what I am and will be going through. At the moment I am at a complete loss. It's the end of the first of two weeks of Fresher's, and I still haven't made any progress. I've got drunk three times out of the five times I went out, and still no drunken making out or hooking up, though I know there are other ways to get with girls. Every time I ask someone for help, they are on repeat. Here are a few examples of what they say, and what I really, really want to reply.""You don't need to rush things b"" = Neither did the guys making out with the girls. I'm not rushing things because I want to, I'm rushing things because I have to. Because if I don't do so by the end of Fresher's, things will get a lot harder as I will have to balance lectures and activities with trying to get with a girl. ""Life is more than just losing your virginity/making out with a girl"" = I know that, and just so people know I know it's not going to fuck with my studies in any way. I won't let it. People have said that so many fucking times, it's not helping. Either offer some real advise or don't. The same can be said of a lot of things, yet people still worry about them.""There are lots of people who are still virgins/didn't make out with a girl"" = Still not helping. It's the same as saying to a depressed person ""lots of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives"". It's a subtle way of saying get over it, which in itself is REALLY not a helpful thing to say.""You'll end up with a lot of embarrassment/awkward situations"" = No. Hell to the no. The same people saying to those who got drunk and embarrassed themselves ""its alright b they wont even remember it when lectures start"" have the audacity to say this to me? There is nothing embarrassing or awkward about being able to say ""I lost my virginity during Fresher's week and it was great"" or ""I made out with her so hard last night"". If anything it will instil confidence. Nobody fucking understands. Nobody. Like drones, all they do is just repeat the same. Fucking. Useless. Advice.I am at my wits' end with this. It runs through my mind every fucking minute of the day. I'm not trying to set up a multinational company, become a multi millionaire, or anything that I know will take time and effort. All I'm looking to do is make out with a girl like all the other guys seem to effortlessly do, and end up taking one back to my place to fuck. Is that so much to fucking ask for?

More of a confession than a cry for help,"I am/was (decide for yourself I guess) a sadistic psychopath. I felt no emotion for anyone, it was all emulated. I was a flawless liar and no one ever suspected I was anyone other than who I presented as. I hated most people and it made me happy to see them suffer. I've never physically harmed anyone, but I have ruined people's lives for no reason other than malice. I'm also a longtime user of this sub and frequently preyed upon those seeking help on here via PM. I suspect some of them killed themselves because of me. It wasn't my specific intention but it gave me an unrivaled feeling of satisfaction.I was also a very reckless and self-destructive person without fear. I would do anything just for the experience without worrying about the consequences. The law of averages caught up to me and I made the mistake that I think is going to end me. I decided to transition into a woman for (at the time) fetishistic reasons using hormones. I lied my way through potential gatekeeping, told them I had dysphoria my whole life and all that, it was easy. A few weeks after starting hormones things got weird and only got weirder the longer it went on. Firstly, I was always planning to kill myself while quite young because I felt like my existence was wrong, it was a very vague feeling but it was intense and I had no fear of death so I just decided I would kill myself whenever life stopped being fun. Very quickly that feeling went away. The next change was I started developing emotionally, a full range of emotions I had never experienced. I always thought I was very good at managing my emotions but I think I just never had any emotions to manage. This was/is quite overwhelming. The change that seems like it's going to be my downfall is my developing emotional empathy. I started to care about people and their struggles, even random strangers. It felt so good I would go to bad neighborhoods and give money to homeless people, sit with them and listen to them talk about their lives. It made me happy to make them happy, and thinking about their pain hurt me. I feel like I'm finally turning into a complete person, I didn't understand how empty I was because I never had anything to compare it to.Along with this emotional empathy, though, was something else that I think won't stop escalating until I either kill myself or have a psychotic break. I started to feel guilty about the kind of person I was before and what I did, and it keeps getting worse and it's already unbearable. On top of this I've started getting flashbacks of childhood trauma, and my sanity is slipping rapidly. I want to kill myself again for these new reasons but hilariously there are people in my life I now care about who would be crushed if I did. If anything can be described as poetic justice it's this I imagine. I could de-transition but I never want to go back to how I was, physically or mentally. I don't expect sympathy or even belief from anyone, but I wanted to type this out anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I never want to hurt anyone ever again, I wish I had never hurt anyone, I wish I could take it all back but I can't and nothing I can do will ever make up for it and I'm sorry.

Why'd they have to take her away from me?,"I�۪m heartbroken, wretched and inconsolable. I�۪m frustrated. I�۪m incandescent. I�۪m furious. I never hated but now I hate you all. I hate the whole of humanity. I want to burn you all in a pire made of your own bones. I want to drown you all in a river made of your own tears. Just like you burned her lifeless body after drowning her in that sinful river that is so sacred to you. Your gods forbid you from taking the lives of cows but wants the life of a girl taken just because she loved another girl. Fuck you!She was beautiful; she was kind; she was the purest thing I�۪d ever seen in my life and now she�۪s gone. God, we only kissed. We didn�۪t hurt or hate. We only held hands and wanted to sleep in each others�۪ arms. We only needed to be happy. We only needed to live. How inhumane and ignorant do you have to be to kill her in the name of a nonexistent god? Religions are suppossed to make you better beings not savages. Apparently, that�۪s what you are; ruthless, clueless savages. May your heavens be filled with ever raging fires of malbolge. Fuck gods and fuck you ignorant bipeds for following them.I remember us laughing about this happening. It was such a silly matter to us. I said I�۪d give my life for hers if it ever comes to that. But I didn�۪t. I couldn�۪t. I was locked up in that cage we call a house and was too much of a pussy to save the love of my life from dying. No, not dying. Being ruthlessly murdered. I was spared because I was the daughter of the rich bastard who had power over people and she was killed because she was the daughter of a poor worker. If only my father was as powerless as hers was.I remember her telling me that no matter what happens she still believed in the goodness of people. That it�۪s your lack of understanding that causes fear and that you would never be stupid enough to take someone�۪s life for just loving another person. That girl believed in humanity so much that I want to eat all your hearts alive for what you did to her.What�۪s even more frustrating is the fucking police. I called them, I cried to them, I wept before them and all they did was standing there while that innocent girl was drowned. The law was deaf to the screams of a lover and blind to the lawlessness of gods and their followers. A blind law for a blind following; it�۪s only fitting. There isn�۪t much you can do about justice when the law is lawless except make your own. And that I will.Not all of you combined would make one of her. No amount of filthy violence you have to offer would compare to a grain of innocence she had. You�۪re scum and your gods are even worse for they are the creations of your collective minds of sin. Even when she was being taken away she told me that it�۪s going to be okay; that god will save us; which they clearly didn�۪t. Instead, they called her a demon, a monster.

Anxiety-fuelled suicidal thoughts,"I've struggled with anxiety for much of my life and it has brought me to the edge of suicide on a few occasions. (I never made any actual attempts. I just had very clear plans that I backed out of at the last or nearly last moment.) When I was 16, I thought I wouldn't live to see 20. At 20, I thought I'd be dead by 25. At 25, the age moved back to 30. Now, at 29, I don't expect to kill myself imminently, but I believe it will be how I die. Finally, after 29 years, I realized that my anxiety brings me here. The fear and worry just grips my mind and won't let go. Either I fear so much about what is happening or I worry so much about what will happen, I start to feel as if suicide is the only way to save me from myself. Two weeks ago I almost made this post. I was in a dark place. I held off. Later, I recovered. That lasted about four days. Now I'm back right where I left off. Afraid, worrying, wanting to escape. The last time I had a plan. I planned to jump of a bridge nearby where I live, a bridge that many people have successfully used to kill themselves in the past. Last time I also tried to put my affairs in order before I killed myself. Now, my plan is still valid and my affairs are still in order. I don't think I'll kill myself tonight. I feel I'll kill myself soon. I have often felt that way though. The frequency with which I feel like killing myself makes me not want to seek help for it. Why worry others when I know I won't do it? But I feel like I will do it. Maybe not tonight, but soon. I'm not sure where this post is heading. It would be helpful for me to hear how others deal with suicidal thoughts driven by their own anxiety. Again, I don't want to die. Like many here, I just don't want to live like this.

No other option,"I'm a 21 y/o female clerk at a convienience store. I've worked with the company for a year and a half. I spent most of that time in a store located in the worst part of the hood. I am very small and not an assertive person. I am technically a PT Sales Clerk but have been doing the work of a FT Assistant Manager. I'm not trying to brag either, it sucks and I never asked for it. I work 40-50 hours or more a week, and handle training employees and shift supervision as well as office work. I was also told while at the bad store that I had no such thing as availability, and that I wasn't allowed benefits. They lied and gave me a package set to expire in two weeks. I couldn't get it back to them in time and now I need to wait two years for my next chance to apply apparently.During my time at the hood store, I was poked with hypodermic needles and had to have blood work done due to it. In the first week I worked there, a senior citizen employee on graveyard shift nearly had his eye cut out with a pizza cutter by a guy on meth. I have also I've been followed home and threatened while at work by gang members that they will cut me up into pieces and leave me in the river. The police never helped us really, they'd give the hood rats a talking to but then they'd come back and threaten you more for calling the cops. I was also the only first aid person on staff, I am an emergency first responder. Near the end of my working there, a man who was known in the area for massive theft and violence overdosed while in the station and smashed his face into a corner of a table. We'd had 4 overdoses prior that week, so I was ready to deal with it. When I went to help him, he couldn't tell it was me and swung at my face before passing out in a sitting position. He had himself up on a chair so I had to hold him to stop him from falling, but he was easily twice or three times my size and I was terrified now since he had gotten violent. I had to scream and beg my coworkers to call 911 and they refused. Another customer had to help me. Once I was free from his care by handing him off to the fire department, my uniform and my arms were covered in blood from his head. I was given a new shirt, but since it was only a half hour into my shift, I was made to stay all night, with blood all over my leggings since they said it'd take too long for me to at least go home and change.I also had a middle aged Field Consultant who was pulling me into the corners f the store with no cameras and telling me that he was going to take me on a two person road trip six hours away so I could train people at a bunch of stores for three weeks, when I hadn't agreed to something like that, and told me not to tell my bosses about it, because I needed to prove I was worth a promotion by proving I could keep my mouth shut. This set off alarm bells, especially when the assistant manager at the time stated that she had watched him on the camera system following me around the store staring directly at me for a full hour. When I confessed all he was saying to my boss and assistant manager, the boss confronted him as was fired instantly. I watched him fire her through the front windows of the store. She moved o my city from across the province to manage our store, and I ruined it and got her fired. The assistant manager was fired next for other reasons. I left the store after the overdose incident, though it was partially to get away from this man as another guy runs the other stores in two.Now my new job at the same company is in an affluent location, but everyone is rude and I've had a father point at my face and tell his kids that I was a great example of why you pay attention in class. So you wouldn't end up like me. All in all though, my new job is so much better, safer. It hasn't done me wrong yet really. But I've started seeing people that were regulars from my old work back, and they recognize me. I'm terrified. I vomit and feel terrified before going to work because all I can think of was my old job. I feel a crushing sense of dread and anxiety, and it's overflowed so much that I want to kill myself the moment I step in the door of that place.My doctor and an employee therapist urged 6-8 weeks of stress leave since my doctor thinks that the stress is 'literally killing me', which I don't believe, and my therapist says my conditions were extraordinary, but I don't think so. Nobody else that works for corner stores or gas stations goes on stress leave, old ladies and essentially worthless skin sacks can work there, so why can't I? Why am I so weak that I can't keep up? Besides, it's not my new jobs fault that I'm feeling this way so why should I punish them by going on a leave?I'm supposed to be better than this. At this point, I'm so terrified of taking stress leave that now I'm starting to be convinced killing myself is the only option. My doctor has me on meds, probably because I'm crazy. I don't know. I don't have any friends either, or a family support net, so don't with that friend shit. And all I have is my boyfriend to talk to but this isn't his problem, I won't saddle him with my weakness.

Couple failed attempts. Exit bag planned. Long read.,"I don't know where to start...My dad died suddenly when I was 19. We'd had a few rocky years like I'm sure a lot of people have, but thankfully the last few months before he died we'd reconciled. It still hurts 21 years later. Not a day goes by where I don't wish he was here. For a long time I dreamt about him. We would be at a baseball game together, he would say he was going to get some hotdogs for us and start up the stairs. The vendor would come by, I'd turn and yell to him. He would look back at me and keep walking. He'd never return. I had that dream 2-5 time a year for quite a few years until recently. I had a messy divorce at 30. Apparently I was drunk and got violent one night. No recollection of the event. Was arrested for felony evading with a vehicle. Ex was kind hearted and did not pursue charges for DV. Wrote the judge explaining I was (am), suffering from mental illness, and preferred treatment over jail. I did 2 years of probation, paid some fines, and moved on. A year later, I met a girl who I fell instantaneously, deeply, and madly in love with. We had great chemistry, and about a year later ended up pregnant and married. My love for her,and our new son grew daily. I still suffered from depression, but it wasn't caused by her. We moved, had some additional stresses, and she told me she wanted to divorce. We reconciled after a few tough months, did some therapy together, patched it up and moved on. Bought a house, got better jobs, had a daughter. 5 years later she's filed for divorce, and is proceeding with it this time. Counseling not an option, doesn't want to work on things, determined to be divorced. She states she hasn't been happy for years, and that we've become different people who are better apart. I don't feel like any of that is true, but she will not change her mind. I certainly played my part over the last few years, losing the balance between work and home, not getting some help with the stress of life, finances, etc. Nothing people haven't gone through, and come out of before. To say I am beyond devastated would be a massive improvement. I tried living with some friends, that didn't help. It led me to my first attempt. I had read a bunch of forums, and blogs, and decided I wanted to go peacefully and ""in tact"". I didn't want to burden my friends with the clean up, or trauma of doing it in their home. I sat in my car and slit both my wrists - the long way, not the help me way. It was a lot harder even with a very sharp knife than I thought, but I did manage a bit of blood out one of them. However, I came to realize why the warm bath is needed. To keep the body from doing its thing, and the blood congealing. So, I was found by my friend and taken involuntarily to a hospital by police. In the hospital, I tried twice to asphyxiate myself, with no luck. Something about them wanting people to ""get better"". I was prescribed some additional meds, dosages changed, reluctantly released after 9 days, and now sent 1500 miles away to live with relatives, and get ""healed up"", work on myself. I haven't seen the kids in 3 weeks, minimal contact from my wife. Seemingly very little concern, but whatever. My kids are almost 9, and 4.5 years old. I cherish them more than anything. I grew up with divorced parents, and step parents on both sides. I still to this day have resentment and hatred for my step mother. I blame her for the relationship between my father and I deteriorating. The thought of another man holding my daughter, playing with my son, any involvement whatsoever makes my heart race, and my body flash with intense heat. Nevermind with my wife. The few times I had seen them after we separated was not a happy time for me. Instead, I was miserable, and hurt, and reminded that we were not a unit anymore. Unable to enjoy their company. My kids get what's going on, and we always cried when I left to go to my new home. My daughter wonders when I will come back to her home. It tears me up thinking about it. I've been wishing, and hoping for an accident, a heart attack, crazy gun wielding psycho for a few weeks. No luck. Pills seem messy and hit or miss at best, gun or jumping is out, again, due to the idea of wanting to be ""in tact"". Then I stumbled upon the exit bag/helium method. I'm planning on doing that sometime in the near future. The bag can be easily made, I can get a tank of helium and a hose for $20, and then, it's about finding a place/time to do it. Go to sleep basically. I know my wife will be devastated, as will the kids, and the rest of my family, but I really feel like leaving now is better than what I know the future will be like. It's unbearable to me. Missing out on the daily routines, split holidays, child support, not coming home to them rushing me at the door saying ""daddy""!! That was always the prize at the end of the day. I'm not looking for support, or empathy, or to be talked down. I just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere.

I'm lost and empty and sad and I don't know where to turn. I need Hope.,"The void is growing bigger. It used to hit in waves but now it�۪s always there, ever present and unrelenting. It pulls me towards the emptiness like a flame draws a moth. The Emptiness. The knowledge that nothing lasts forever used to give me hope. Hope was all that I had to keep me going. This can�۪t last forever right? Nothing can! But that�۪s not where I stand today. Today I stand at the precipice. The edge of the cliff. But the urge to jump isn�۪t from L�۪appel du vide. It�۪s from deeper inside than that. The void. It pushes me to the brink and tries to nudge me that last little bit. Hope held it back. Hope was my mighty defender, my protector, my savior from the void. But hope can�۪t last forever either. Nothing can! Hope is dead and I�۪m left to fight the void by myself. I did it once before. Fueling my battle with the rage of a berserker. A furious vengeance behind every strike and blow. But I�۪m not angry this time, I�۪m nothing. I�۪m cold and empty and I feel like the void has already won. I see the emptiness and I think it can be the end of my struggle. Peace. What does that even mean? It�۪s even foreign to me as an intellectual concept. It�۪s not something I have any experience with so I wonder if it�۪s even real. It sounds like it would be fun to try. To wake up without the void pulling at my brain. For my heart not to ache with every beat. 34 years now I�۪ve walked this earth and for 34 years I�۪ve felt lost among it. Always searching for my place, my home. I thought I found it several times along the way but that couldn�۪t last forever right? Nothing can! People grow and change and the sad truth is they always grow away from me. No one has ever grown towards me. Perhaps that�۪s the greatest tragedy in life. The ability to make such deeply rooted connections to others only to watch as they eventually decay into nothingness. Emptiness. There�۪s that call again, and I feel the prodding finger of the void and the callous whisper at my ear. A moonlit serenade performed just for me and offering the seduction of every promise and wish I have fullfilled. Peace. Serenity. But could it last forever? Nothing can! Perhaps if I look hard enough I can find some Hope laying around, discarded from a mind weaker than my own that gave in on this very precipice in days lost to time. Perhaps this bit of Hope can connect with me and maybe something can grow towards me and away from everyone else. We could work together as protectors and defenders of each other. Two-way saviors working hand-in-hand to battle the void back, and maybe it would last forever!

Why do I feel this way,"I have a big meme account on Instagram. I'm a really successful athlete. I'm popular. No one knows that I want to just fucking die. I just want to die more than anything. I'm 17 and live on my own in the basement of some bodies house. I pay rent. I'm successful by social standards. But what made me realize I wanted to die was while I was writing something to a girl I've been talking to for a while. I'm just gonna copy and paste it. Keep in mind we are best friends in snapchat so I talk to her the most out of anyone and she's the same with me. Also we hang out for hours. Also she is really really hot. And not basic. Here it isFirst of all I'm glad I met you and we are not gonna stop talking cause there is no one else I'd rather talk to. Second of all I'm sorry for making you cry. That was really weird for me cause I haven't been that close to crying in a really long time.  Third I think you're confused and conflicted and a lot of that is my fault which makes me feel even worse. I say this cause one second you're telling me how you want to break up with your boyfriend and staying up with me till 3 in the morning talking about complete bullshit just so we don't have to hang up. Then the next you tell me how you just want to friendzone me and that you want a hug from your boyfriend and you need to talk to me less. And it hurts me.  Cause it pulls me in closer to you. And then you push me away. And obviously you could just stop talking to me and me to you. But I don't want that. I really don't. I actually have fun being around you no matter what it is we are doing. And I know you feel the same.
I hate being something that causes stress in your life Mary. I just want to make you happy. But it's hard to try and maintain a balance of supporting you in what's best for you, when what's best for you is awkward for us to talk about. You have a boyfriend yeah. A boyfriend in a different state who you may see once or twice a year who you don't love anymore but you have fond memories of.  And it's really hard cause you're for real my dream girl which sounds really gay and edgy and I cringe at my awkwardness as I type this but it's true. I haven't ever said some gay shit like that before. And I know you have flaws and insecurities but that's what I like about you. You're really complex and it's really amazing. And I really like everything about you. And I know it may be hard to read this but that's life Mary. Life is fucking hard. Some days I'm miserable and regret everything I've ever done. I wake up in a cold basement every morning and walk to my cold kitchen and drink a glass of water from the sink. Then I take a shower and get dressed in the clothes I bought with my own money and walk the silent 30 minutes to school. I normally don't say my first word in the morning till at least an hour after I woke up. Cause I have no one to say it too. I feel so lonely sometimes. And it's weird cause I wake up to 60 messages of people calling me a god and trying to pay me to make them bigger. So why do I feel so lonely and awful. Why do I feel like no one actually cares. Except you. The person who says she doesn't care. The person who acts like me and her don't matter at all and that she doesn't even care. Why do I feel like she's one of the few people who care so much. There's no way I'm wrong. I don't even know if I'm going to send this cause I'm a pussy no matter how tough I might act. And if I did send it it's only cause I'm scared that if i don't, I'll lose you.

Unhappy with my job,"Working at a wholesale club for 3 years now. I started this job while enrolled in college.

long story of my shitty life,"So this all started around 5 years ago when my great grandad died. I didn't know him very well as i was around 8 or 9 at the time but when he died all I remember is my mum lying with my dogs crying her eyes out. I now know this is because my mum didn't have a dad growing up so she saw him as one. my great grandad dying caused my mum to become heavily depressed which soon progressed into alcoholism.My mum being an alcoholic. it has been going on for around 5 years now but I will just tell you all the times I can remember that are significant. First one is around 3 - 4 years ago my mum got shit faced and left, we found her a few hours later (I say we but it was my brother and dad as i was 10) and she came back and yelled then passed out. second time was a repeat of 1 just around a year later (it happened a few times.) 6th time (biggest) it was November 5th and my family was throwing a bonfire for some friends of there's (they used to be mine but I will get to that) and we made a huge bonfire behind our house in a field but we left our mum and her friend because it was cold and they didn't vcare but by the time we had gotten back my mum had drank around 3-4 bottles of wine (the equivalent of a pint of JD) and was out of it. later that night there friends have gone, my brother was sleeping in my room because he was scared of my mum (as when me and my dad were directing our guests back as they were wattlking) she had being saying things to him like ""do you want to die"" (she was drunk) later that night we woke up to the sound of my mum banging and yelling at my dad ""Alan, I need a fucking wee"" then started throwing stuff and smashing stuff so my dad called the police and she was put in a drunk ward for a 12 hours. final one for now, it was around june and my brothers girlfriend was around and he had bought me some csgo keys and made me a coke and rum (i'm 14 so there was 10:1 coke to rum) and he had left like 100ml left and it was gone so he asked my mum and she started freaking out yelling at my brother girlfriend to get the fuck out of her house and that she is not welcome and the same at my brother and sines then (around 2 and a half months I have seen him once) and I had to spend the night at my mums friends house and she didn't pick up her phone and knowing how she is and what she has done before I thought she had slit her wrists and died this time.moving 200 miles away.

Two bridges.,"There are two bridges my mind are focused on right now in my hometown, both of which I'm thinking of jumping off.One of them will make me plunge into a river.

I�۪ve tried to get better. The medication either makes it worse or doesn�۪t help. Therapy is just arseholes trying to force ideas and issues onto me just so I fit into a neat little box for them. I�۪ve been sent to hospital because they were that worried I was going to kill myself. Nothing helps. At this point I�۪m convinced the only way for me to get better is to find some way to solve my problems by myself. I�۪ve spent the last twelve years trying to get better by myself.

Am I suicidal?,"Sorry if this is the wrong place, wrong topic, or wrong crowd. This is my first Reddit post I've ever made, and I'm just hoping to find a voice and some echoes back in the darkness. I don't actually post online in general, but I am aware of trigger warnings and how seriously people take them, so, uh, obviously trigger warning about suicidal thoughts, and also self-harm, and pretty much every kind of abuse.TL;DR: Long history of abuse, have never emotionally worked it out, doctor re-traumatized me very recently, this became an opportunity to connect with my therapist on a level where I could trust him enough to finally address old pain, until he realized he made a mistake, had to break my trust and do the one thing I was trying to avoid. Now I feel crushed and a sense of futility and am making stupid risky choices that could kill me, but not committing to a proper suicide plan. What's going on with me? Am I suicidal, or something else?TL:
I don't know if I am actually suicidal, crying for help, looking for attention, overreacting, or what. I cannot commit to fully going through with it, so I feel like I still have hope. I somehow always find hope. But I am also hurting so deeply and feel like it will never get better, and am starting to obsess about the release of death. I have a way planned out to do it, should I ever fully commit to it. It's one of those things that I do not want to mess up. And the way I have 'planned' out is simple, requires little preparation or supplies, is easily accessible, and is practically foolproof. Basically, I have no excuse not to do it 'right,' at any time of my choosing, if I actually choose to kill myself at all. But I'm not there yet.What I have been doing is going to sleep most nights on a handful of random prescription meds and some shots of tequila. It was mostly last week, and it was mostly combinations I felt very confident would cause me no long-term harm. Why do I mix them at all? I suppose it satisfies some burning need for self-destruction, especially lately since I have been hurting deeply.The thing is, there were at least two nights last week, and especially one, where I flat out took a couple combinations of medications that are known to be fatal. And I didn't just take the doses I was prescribed...I took double, or triple, or quadruple on some pills. Then I added a bunch more pills, just 'cause - especially if they had obvious warnings about interactions with alcohol. Then of course I took a few shots of tequila. Then I took more pills. I recall thinking to myself, 'well, this may ACTUALLY kill me this time. Hell, by all rights it probably will.' I had survived taking the base combination of meds before, but only at single doses of each, or double-dose at most. And that was back when I was taking a LOT of meds, and had quite the tolerance. And I'd never mixed them with some of the things I did this time, which only enhanced the danger and chances of dying. And I totally knew what I was doing, and that - not only was there a CHANCE I could die, but by that point, a likelihood. And I went to bed feeling great. Light. Peaceful. I guess in my mind, I saw it as all of the advantages of suicide, and all of the advantages of an accident, which sounds terrible but is what it is. Some stubborn part of me doesn't want to admit defeat and choose to kill myself. Some part of me doesn't want my friends, few though they are, to think I wanted to do that to them. Some part of me still has hope, but I don't know why because I seriously have every ounce of hope crushed in my life somehow. The rest of me is exhausted, and really really hurting, and tired of trying my hardest and being defeated at every step. And those parts of me figured this was great - I would go to bed feeling calm and peaceful and guilt-free, because I 'legitimately' (in my mind) was not TRYING to kill myself, and I wasn't sure if I was going to die, so I would either never wake up and never know any better, and all of my problems would be solved without any of the guilt or misery of 'real' suicide, and my friends could wonder what made me so airheaded that night that I OD'd, instead of what made me so miserable that night that night that I killed myself. Or, I would wake up, still be alive, and not be any worse off than I was the night before, and maybe even wake up with a newfound sense of appreciation for life. Spoiler alert: I lived, sans new appreciation for life.Now I am at a crossroads. I am out of all of the meds I used in the heavy-hitter nights, so I really don't think I have any meds I could take - even with alcohol - to accidentally kill me. But I'm still fantasizing about it, and obsessing about it. The more nights I go without some crazy OD, the more planning I do for my real life plans of suicide (updating my will, planning accommodations, etc). I suppose now is a good time to mention that I am taking antidepressants, and I regularly see a therapist. I really like my therapist, and I have been open with him so far about everything - even about the overdose of pills, even though I really didn't want to admit it. He's a good guy, and I have a lot of respect for him. There's just one problem right now...It starts with my doctor, who I am no longer seeing. The TL;DR on that is he screwed up big time, said things tailor-fit to fuck me up (eg suggestions that I was 'asking' for sexual abuse as a toddler, shouldn't legally pursue the people who gang-raped me when I was 12 because they probably thought they were doing me a favor, and concerns that I was delusional and imagining present day porn into my past...and it just goes on). And of course, despite outright telling him I did not want to have sexual contact with him, he came onto me. I was in the middle of trying to finalize a very tricky diagnosis, so I'll admit that I let that continue for weeks because I was too afraid to lose progress. The good news is after four years of fighting, I finally got a diagnosis. The bad news is I'm dying. Win some, lose some?I finally told my therapist about what was happening, under his word that it would remain in complete confidence and he would not have to report it. Telling him was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I can talk about my childhood trauma without batting an eye, but this was different. This made me feel vulnerable, and I took every ounce of trust and faith I had, and for the first time in my life, I allowed myself to put that in someone else's hands. It may seem like a minor thing to talk about, but for me, it was both symbolically and literally the hardest, most personal, scariest, and most meaningful thing I have ever told someone. It became the biggest weight I have ever felt lifted off of me. As we continued to talk about it, I found two things were happening:I was feeling a lot more confident, and my sense of self-worth was going back up. I started considering reporting my doctor because what he did was wrong, and I did not want others to get hurt.I was feeling much more connected to my therapist. Our confidence started opening emotional connections I've been lacking all my life, with others and within myself. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to make the connection I so desperately needed to finally confront the bigger stuff from my past, and also to finally have autonomy and feel empowered in standing up to an abusive situation (with my doctor) that had recurred all too many times in my life. It was a second chance to turn the fate of a recurring abusive scenario from my past around. so I was empowered, AND an opportunity to FINALLY, after decades of desperate soul-searching, tap into everything holding me back from confronting my demons and finally having closure in my life, especially before I die. That trust and that connection became the most precious, rare, and important thing I'd ever had in my life. I know that may sound pathetic to a lot of you, but understand that in my life, it is literally a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing.For the first time since my flashback and depression hit, I felt true hope, energy, and empowerment for my future, and for my future work. I'd never been able to have the kind of trust needed to delve into the emotions attached to my childhood trauma, but here it seemed to finally be developing all on its own. It was literally the first time in my life I felt like I stood a chance of tackling those issues - which is more important to me than ever, since I want to reclaim them as part of my life before I go, and frankly my time is ticking.I got the gut feeling that it was time to take action against my doctor. I marched into my therapist's office feeling strong. I knew it would suck, but I was ready to take it on, and it was my choice, and I knew he would be supportive. So, of course, before I said anything that day, he opened with an update that he had since realized he'd been wrong about the reporting requirements, that it was an honest oversight, that he'd tried everything he could to keep his end of the bargain, but that he had to break trust and was required to report the incident. To his credit, he was transparent about it, did everything he could to work around it, and then did everything he could to make sure it wouldn't happen to anyone else. To my credit, that doesn't make me hurt any less.I know it seems silly. You might say, 'well you were going to report him anyway, so what does it matter?' and I'd even be inclined to agree. I think what is killing me is, the issue of trust - it was really, REALLY hard for me to trust my therapist, and relying on that trust and telling him was the hardest thing I've had to do, and the most trust I had to extend, since I was a small child. It was really, really meaningful to me, so even symbolically, breaking that trust is heartbreaking. Secondly, his mandatory reporting takes away my autonomy. If I changed my mind and decided not to report it, for whatever reason, it would no longer be my choice. And finally, in a few words it erased that feeling of emotional connection and trust I finally had, for the first time in my life, to work on these horribly traumatic issues I've had bottled up since I was old enough to have memories. To lose that...there are no words.I don't know what to do. I'd like to think that we can work through this. I know he is genuinely remorseful, and that it was an honest mistake. But I also know he doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it is to me, or that it was opening up my trust to my bigger issues. In fact, he kept trying to convince me that my outburst of hurt and pain was really just a transference of the pain I was feeling from being traumatized by my doctor. That might have been one of the most hopeless feeling moments in my life.I don't want to see another therapist. I don't think a different therapist will be any better. If anything, I'll just lose the trust and work I've established with my current therapist. And the trust that we built is not something that can just come from talking to someone. I stand just as much a chance of getting it back from him as I do getting it in the first place with someone else - IF I ever get it again. But I'm in my 30s, and that is the first time IN. MY. LIFE. that I felt that opening up, despite years of therapy, positive attitudes, success with life, and all of the right circumstances to have tapped it before now. It was a miracle I had the chance to get there once, and that happened because of a freak trauma that I HOPE to not have to repeat with anyone else again. So, here I am. In the middle of the night, on Reddit, typing my first post, which is embarrasingly long (and this is the short version), looking at my bottle of tequila, knowing I have to go to work tomorrow and put my brain full-force into intense thinky work things, wanting nothing more than to feel the pleasant floaty buzz of a drink and a few muscle relaxants, and maybe not wake up, ever again, and not have to try to explain to my therapist again that, I'm sorry, even though you weren't the bad guy here, what you did is really the thing that is hurting me, and I don't know that I will ever recover, which means I don't know that I will ever go on to accomplish my goals before I die. And the more I keep trying and failing like I have the rest of my life, the more it's just going to feel painful and empty in the end. And it's a sobering thought.So then I soberly think about whether I'm ready to go through with my full-fledged suicide plan, or whether I'm willing to risk what is left of my hope (almost none) and my fighting spirit (all but burnt out) on some pipe dream of regaining this elusive sense of trust that only ever materialized from a traumatic anomaly, or whether I'm still stuck on tequila and prescription meds. And whether I'm suicidal at all.Thanks for listening, and for making it this far.",A2,0.85,"The individual expresses deep emotional pain, mentions suicidal thoughts and risky behavior, but also indicates some hope and lack of commitment to a self-harm plan.

eh.,"im not 100% sure when i might take action to kill myself yet, but im going to get ready soon. my gcses are around the corner and the only subjects im good in are science and math, that doesnt matter since im in the n level stream. i may be one of the top students in class but my other subjects can drag me down and im actually really fucking stupid. other than all the education stress, bulimia decides to cling onto me since june of 2017. ive been doing it non-stop since. it takes up most of my time now and i would either 1. starve or 2. spend 3 hours each binge and purge sessionfamily issues also barged in near the beginning of the year where this drunk prostitute from my fathers side of the family decides to barge in and thinks shes superior enough to let her hatred towards my mom drive her to spread rumours and manipulate other family members. she tried to physically attack my mom at one family gathering and i ended up fighting and strangling the bitch. now i feel nothing but hatred and betrayal from the family because everyone begged me not to call the police, stop fighting, etc. i only recognize my dad and mom as family now despite them hating each other. sometimes, my dads side of the family comes to visit my dad, and when my mom isnt at home, they would take the opportunity to talk to me but i would throw shade at them or give them short answers. sometimes, they give me money as if they fucking pity me or are trying to bribe my trust. fuck, i dont want to feel like a orphan or a beggar, im doing well without having to deal with them as much as i had to in the fucking past.dad is basically driving himself insane since hes getting old and skipping multiple work days. he also tells me constantly about how he doesnt want a funeral and just wants to be cremated. as well as reminding me that when i leave the house(get married) hes going to kill my mother slowly, torture etc. hes all words and no action. did i mention he stays home 24/7 most days and is racist as hell? (he denies being racist but all his verbal remarks and actions with our muslim neighbours differs) my mom is just lonely and barely hanging on, trying to help this sack of burden here to get a good education, live healthy, etc etc but shes kind of a hypocrite and has 0 knowledge about food and nutrition(just like my dad) and tries her best to ignore other possible mental disorders i might have. (ptsd from the family fight, depression from bullying in kindergarten, primary and secondary school, anxiety from wherever the fuck it came from) i have had panic attacks infront of her, i have randomly started crying infront of her, i have screamed and yelled at her because i was too scared to eat, but she just always tries to blame it on something else, ""this is what happens when you use the internet so much"", ""you got your fathers genes"" etc. i had three very close friends. one of them is skinny and emotionally abusive girl , another pretty and charming girl , and one funny and reckless guy. lets name them x, y and z respectively. y left me first because apparently she has found other friends who are much more humorous and flattering, then z because he found that my personalities and humour was dying along with my body through bulimia and x? she hasnt left me yet, just constantly sticking to me on my worst days to drive me insane.haha. yeah. thanks for letting me rant, reddit.

Sweating after surgery,"About 5 years ago I had a surgery called Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS). This was meant to stop my palms and underarms from sweating. Before I had it I was told it was reversible because they were going to clip the nerve instead of cut it. I wasn't told about any other side effects, and I trusted the doctors.Some time after the surgery I learned that many people experience what is known as compensatory sweating (CS); the sweating might stop in one area, but now they sweat in another area. It usually happens right away, but sometimes it takes years before it starts. I also learned that ETS is irreversible, even with the clips. The damage to the nerves has been done.For 4 years I didn't experience any CS until this past year, and it has made my life absolute hell. I sweat profusely from my legs, buttocks, back, and face. I feel lied to and cheated by my doctors. I wish I could go back before the surgery, but now I will sweat all over my body for the rest of my life. I never would have done this if I knew the risks.I heard about drugs called anticholinergics which can stop the sweat, but also stop other body secretions like saliva causing dry mouth and sore throat. I tried those for a couple of weeks with some success, but I then started to experience muscle twitches all over my body. After searching I discovered muscle twitches are an unlisted side effect of anticholinergic use. It has been about 4 months and I still experience almost constant muscle twitches despite stopping the meds when it started. I've developed insomnia because I can't sleep due to the muscle twitches.At this point I feel like my life has been ruined and I am absolutely hopeless. I can't have a normal relationship with anyone because of the stigma of being sweaty. Doctor here have no answer besides different anticholinergic drugs. I am hesitant to try any of them at this point because I still twitch all over my body. On the internet I found a doctor in Taiwan that does a procedure to stop sweating specifically caused by this surgery, but if I wanted to treat all of my body it would be over $100,000. As someone unemployed who just finished college I can't even imagine paying for that, or even finding any job at this point.I've been to two psychologists, and neither of them have been very helpful. They've essentially told me I have to deal with it. Nothing they've said to help me cope has been of any use. The second one said, after explaining what happened, ""that sucks,"" which only made me more upset.I probably would have killed myself by now if it wasn't for my parents and a slight hope something might make it tolerable. I already had other body-image issues which have made me extremely depressed prior to CS starting. I've talked to my mom about my problems, and she made me promise that I'd keep trying to find something that helps. I know if I died it would kill her as well. She cares about her kids more than anything else. She already suffers from depression due to her own medical problems that cause physical pain. I love my mom too much to hurt her, but it's so difficult to keep going when nobody else understands. I wish I never had this surgery done.If anyone actually took the time to read all of this, thank you I appreciate it.

I've been thinking...,"Hello!Throughout the past few months i've been thinking about my life lately. Let me see where i should start. I'm a first year college student who is studying abroad. At first i was alright with the idea of coming to another country to study and learn their culture. Probably a month ago i felt confident that i can make it in college. I've been dreaming about where i'm going to be in the future. One of the main reasons why i'm studying medicine abroad is that my hometown is limited with their med majors. I saw it an an opportunity to explore what's it like outside of my home.All of that changed by the time i set foot in my college. Prior to this, i've been given this idea that the college that i will be attending is ""international"", particularly prominent in english. By the time i entered my designated class for orientation, everyone spoke in their native tongue. I had to notify everybody (students, faculty, etc.) about my dilemma. I knew that i had to learn the language someday, but i didn't expect it to occur that quickly. Aside from this language barrier my ability to understand in college has been rather difficult. My schedule for college seemed right before hand since i felt confident when i read it (curse my lazy senior year in high school).  I've been feel overwhelmed every time i start my classes. I always felt like i'm stressed out every time. The worst part is when i knew i couldn't take and i'll i could think about it to simply end it once and for all. I took counseling at least 2 during the two months and i don't think it's working. My counselor seemed well and my classes as well. I think the problem is just me as a whole. I can't cooperate properly. It's probably because that i'm stressed about college lately. I've been having morbid thoughts about life though, especially before. I can't really say that i'm always depressed all of the time but i usually hide it in front of my peers or family members. At most, they would see me stay quiet all of the time. I haven't eaten properly during the first 2 weeks of college because i took on the idea to ""breathe studying"" since i'm in college and in a med major.My confidence crashed to the ground when my classes started. I felt like i can handle the work at first but when everything weighed on me i just been having a harder time ti cope with it. My peers seem to be fine with the work and they would achieve high grades. I don't mean to compare myself to them but it's just that i'm trying to at least not fall beindRight now, there hasn't been much classes lately due to a variety of events and my exams (hopefully i didn't fail). However, i know that by the time the class starts again, i will go back to being stressed out all of the time. I'm afraid to become depressed again and even through counseling advice it hasn't motivated me enough to escape it.The worst part of all is that i'm afraid to go back to hometown and study there. I might study into a different course aside from med but i'm afraid i might not succeed there as well. I've really been thinking too much about this but it's the fact that this is the next step to my life and i'm afraid to mess that up. That's where i fall into depression and thoughts of suicide. It's a horrible habit and i don't know how to overcome this situation.",A1,0.85,"The text describes challenges related to adjusting to a new environment, language barriers, and academic difficulties, but does not indicate immediate risk or severe distress.

"2 weeks from now, I'm going to say goodbye.","Apologies for the formatting and grammar errs in advance. English is not my mother tongue and I ain't no smart either.I don't know if I'll succeed this time. But I think I will. It will be painful but I promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace, endless peace. At least for me. I don't know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will I do it but yes, I'll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a ten-wheeler truck. I just can't find any other way; a gun is way too expensive and I find jumping off a bridge, from a building or by hanging being too cliche. I don't want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest I could find. At least it will guarantee my death. Enough with how I plan to end it but this is my story.I'll save you my personal information but so long as I can remember, I've been depressed and suicidal for 7 years; 6 and half to be precise since I wouldn't be here in October in anyway. I started to develop depression after I was kicked out in the Seminary. I was in Highschool Seminary and I've always wanted to serve God and become a priest but alas, I was in High School. I bullied and got bullied, it's a common standard. Albeit I befriended myself (I was on Junior High) with a Freshman. He has no friends whatsoever since he was not friendly to anybody. I can't exactly remember what started our feud but I bullied him since for his ungratefulness; I was his only friend yet he does not treat me so kindly. I can't remember how we reconciled and became friends again later on. I don't know if it was part of his master plan but since I was in High School (and a virgin), we begun perversely mocking our teachers especially our librarian. There I made an indecent letter addressed to our librarian to allow me to have sex with her, signed with a forged signature of our monsignor. He took the letter and reported me; to which I beat him up for. Few days later, the council had a meeting and decided to not allow me to enroll in the seminary for the following year. I was devastated. I pleaded badly. I sent letters to the Seminary formators and the Archbishop himself and found out the prick made a story that I had an affair with him, making my situation worse. Didn't realize I will never recover from this.Then begun my trust issues. I graduated High School in a different school with less friends than I had before. I went to College and found new friends but my trust issues later kicked in and I transferred to another school. This time, it was worse. My anxiety and trust issues were so severe I was unable to make any friends, none whatsoever. I'm in a four-year course and sadly, I'm on my sixth year now due to failing grades and tons of no-grade status. I took same courses consistently for 2 semesters while barely hanging by a thread. I had two probations, and it took me 5 semesters to finish 2 semester- CWTS/ROTC. I went 6 years in college with literally no friends. I eat alone, everyday somewhere far where nobody would recognize me. I don't hang out with anyone nor I can't remember having any decent conversation with anybody. I always find a way to avoid people even to the point of punishing myself for them to avoid me. The anxiety was so severe, I purposely don't brush my teeth nor apply deodorant just so people would avoid me. Albeit that didn't stop them from inviting me to fraternities which I politely refuse. You see, I get easily irritated like every depressed people. I may not look like one but I'm freakishly strong; probably because of pent up anger within me. I often try to channel my frustration through boxing and picking fights but that doesn't seem to satisfy me. Sex also doesn't soothe me. It's a temporary pleasure but it doesn't help me in a long-shot. I even thought I was homosexual since girls doesn't seem to satisfy me but the thought of having sex with another guy disgusts me. Never went down that road but I'm pretty sure I'm straight. Anyway, the only courses left for me next semester are seminars and On the-Job-Trainings to which I fear I won't succeed. I've never made any friends in college and envy my sister for living the life I wish I had. I love my family, I really do. This is why I've survived 7 years of suicidal depression just for them. I've hurt them before, both mentally and physically (thrice: hit my sister twice and boxed with my father which I clearly lost). I'm not proud of it, I can't control myself but they love me still. They didn't realize my condition until last year where it had gone so severe that I was barely about to hide it. I started banging my head against a wall until I pass out about 3 years ago. Every morning I cry myself out on how I was still alive, hoping I wasn't able to wake up. Every night I hope will be my last. But it never came. I tried-to many to count stupid, menial suicide attempts. I've strangled myself with a blanket, drowned myself in a pail, bought sleeping pills from the black market but all of that, I was able to resist. My body somehow instinctively survives and resists them. I remember passing out after I strangled myself with a blanket and woke up with my arms unwrapping them. I remember waking and coughing up blood in the bathroom after trying to drown myself. I remember my hair went crazy after I showered and stuck my fingers on the socket without my hands being burnt to crisps. I remember waking up after continuously banging my head on the concrete wall on my room with blood everywhere and surviving. I've always find a way for my family not to notice it. I'm quick to work on cleaning the blood stains and covering what happened. I don't want them to see any physical attempts of suicide. I even bought a neck bracer to hide the ruffs on my neck.Then I begun hearing voices. I know it's me but it feels like someone else. It wanted me to kill my family whom I loved dear. The voices were overwhelming I begun banging my head in-front of my family hoping it would stop. It concerned them so bad. Several weeks later, they overheard me singing some kind of suicide song, dizzy from continuous head banging. Later at the end of that semester, they sent me to rehab. They conspired with a psychiatrist to which I revealed everything. They drugged me, kidnapped me and had my ass on rehab. It didn't help. Rehab feels like a deterrent instead of a recovery. I stayed for a month in the facility and deterred any physical manifestations of my suicidal tendencies after I got out. I no longer bang my head on a concrete wall, I just punch the shit out of it. I boxed, so I know where to hit it.I learned from my psychiatrist I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder with extreme suicidal tendencies. Coupled with social anxiety, agora phobia, severe trust issues, anti-social personality disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and PTSD. PTSD not from a life-threatening situation but PTSD from getting kicked out of the seminary. I've met all the conditions except the first requirement.I don't want to leave my family but if I continue to live my life, I might end up doing something I regret. I don't want to hurt my family nor anyone else ever again. I'm doing myself a favor. No one is going to love someone like me. I'll save my future children some problems, I don't want them to inherent my depression. I forgot to mention I'm no longer religious. I never had God with me nor felt any divine presence ever since I acquired depression. I was all alone. Despite the family support and help, I still feel alone. And I would rather die alone. If this was karma for all the wrongs I've did, I believe this is too excessive of a punishment. If there is a good God, I don't know why my depression is part of his plan or anything. If there is hell, well, I rather be there instead of being here. I just hope they can never uncover my plan. I'm tired guys. I really am. It's selfish to commit suicide but I don't think I'll be any of good use in the future. I'll be an inconvenience. Depression made me stone-cold. I had crushes but I never felt love. Sex wasn't love, it was fun. What's sad is the only thing that keeps me alive today and wanting to live for the following years are TV-shows and movies. That's all. Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Lucifer, DBZ super, Avengers, Justice League, etc. I've watch too many shows and movies alone. The only imaginry friends I had were TBBT, HIMYM and FRIENDS. But I think none of that will matter. I won't remember anything of that when I'm dead anyway.2 week countdown from now. I'll wait for the semester to end. I'll die with fashion, wearing my favorite jeans, shoes and shirt. I'll be busy preparing my death, farewell letters and stuff. Plus, I major in Psychology.

Until now. A recent break up has made me spiral into a state of despair I could never imagine possible. Those feelings of worthlessness I've spent nearly a decade fighting off all came back in one moment. This constant feeling of hopelessness, pain, I can't take it anymore. The one person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with, has deleted me from hers as though I meant nothing. It's ruined me. I try to put on a brave face, remind myself that eventually I will get over this and move on but that doesn't work. Nothing I do helps. A few days ago, it just came to my mind, that I would be better off dead and ever since, it's all I can think about. I even dreamt about successfully killing myself.

Is this normal?,"Hey,These days I've been feeling down. At school I barely talk with friends (also since we are in different classes). I laugh at jokes, but as soon as I am alone, I start to think of how I get hurt. Example: When I stand at the bus stop, I imagine how I would jump infront of a car and get hit. There is something holding me back, and I am probably too scared to do it anyway. In the last hours, I started to push myself to do impulses things, like throwing my phone. I am signed up to do workout, but I'm not feeling like it. I lied to my parents, that I went to the gym even though I didn't, and now they don't talk to me and say what an asshole I am. Granted, I am rude to my parents sometimes, and now they keep talking what an unthankful asshole I am. These things might be right, but it brings me to another point: I get angry pretty quickly lately. It's not that I have some uncontrolled aggression disorder, idk. The point is, I imagine myself being hit and being in a coma/unconscious, but am too scared to be permanently dead.

Ruined my life and his.... Wishing to end it all.,"I guess I'll preface this with the fact that I am a 22 year old female. I recently got alternatively certified to teach in TX. Without doing research on the school I accepted a job as a 4th grade teacher in a shit town in South Texas called Victoria. The situation I was placed into was dismal at best. Everyone on the 4th grade team was new, 2 of us first year teachers, the other new to the district. We were given very little guidance or instruction. The job wore at me, I couldn't sleep at night I woke up every hour with horrible anxiety. 4 months previously I had met the man of my dreams, he didn't have it all together but we fell in love fast and hard. He had decided to take a job where he'd be on the road traveling installing turf. His job kept falling through little by little and he wanted to be with me in Victoria. One Friday the overwhelming stress of the job got the best of me and I made the mistake of telling another teacher at the school that of I had a gun I would have already killed myself..
Counselors and interventionist a stepped in and escorted me to a crisis center via cop car. Shortly there after my boyfriend decided to quit his turfing gig to come be with me thinking he'd easily find work... Which wasn't the case. He ended up doing day labor for 10-12 an hour... But depressed i still was. I scored a job as a restaurant manager, but through my Depression I couldn't think clearly and the job seemed overwhelming and too much as well. I ended up realizing I needed professional help. And my parents are in a position to help so I called them and I left and went back to the DFW. Leaving my boyfriend in victoria tx, almost broke. With no job and no one to help him like I have... He took a weed charge for me near San Marcos and then got another ticket for driving with an invalid license. So he has all this court stuff to go to in South TX and anyone he knows is in North TX. I haven't felt myself in a long time. I feel incredible guilt and shame and resentment towards myself for my inability to keep it together. I have suicidal thoughts daily. I've lost 10 ppunds from not eating properly. Worst of all is just knowing that I have essentially ruined not only my own life but his life too. When all he ever tried to do was help me and he believed me when I said that I'd be able to make it and that he should come down and be with me. Boy was I wrong. The regret I feel for the struggle he will face is haunting. He will most likely lose everything he has worked for. His truck will be repossessed and none of this would have happened if it weren't for me.

"I don't know who or what I am, I'm drowning in work and classes, and I just can't take it anymore. [Long]","I hate every last part of who I am, from my gender to my hair color and everything else. I hate the bloody, disgusting hole between my legs and wish I could fill it with cement. PIV is not pleasurable for me and stresses me out. Menstruation, pregnancy, and birth all sound horrible. Maybe I'd want a kid of my own one day, but I have no desire to carry that baby, and my male SO can't do it...I hate the balls of fat on my chest and wish I could cut them off and just have a flat chest like a guy. I have red hair that everyone is constantly commenting on. I don't like the attention. I've cut it very, very short (like a 5 with clippers) and wear a hat partially to hide it and keep it from drawing attention. I hate the apartment my SO and I are living in. He's asked me to vocalize what I hate about it specifically, but I'm honestly not even sure exactly what it is. But I honestly do. For the first few weeks, I couldn't stand being there at all, and hid under the bed to not have to see it while I cried about it. Eventually, I just kind of accepted it. I still hate it, but I don't constantly cry about that in particular.I'm currently attending a school I hate, doing a double major in 2 subjects I don't necessarily love. One's difficult and I took it on because my SO and a friend thought I'd be good at it. The other's a bullshit major; something to fall back on in case I fail out of the hard one. I used to be a perfect student, but last semester I failed a class for the first time and had to repeat it over the summer.I don't want to sound like I'm blaming anyone or like I'm playing the victim, but I'm going to end up sounding that way. A lot of my problems stem from an abusive mother (physically, verbally, emotionally) and my abusive ex (rapist). I haven't spoken to my mother in over a year, and sometimes I wish I had a real mother. I was with my ex for 2 years and raped hundreds of times during that span. He pinned me down and had me call him ""master"". I've been self-harmer since. But recently, I've gotten a lot more reckless with it. I used to cut on just one thigh, then moved to just one hip when I couldn't hide my thigh very well in the summer. Now, I'm cutting from my thighs to the top of my breasts, and everything in between, as well as my wrists.I've given up completely on making friends. I lost all my friends in high school thanks to the mess I became with my ex. I don't talk to people in class, and I don't go any more in depth than necessary with customers and random people who try to engage me. All my emotions seem muted. Anxiety has taken a backseat, and now I just try to force myself to go to class and do the bare minimum to keep up appearances that I'm a normal, functioning human being. I don't really feel anything at all, let alone love, for my family, and even my feelings for my SO seem muted or hard to access (I'm not totally sure how to explain it...).But I'm still a mess. And there's nothing i can do about it. I want to die. I can't handle 18 credits, 2 jobs, and relationships. I can't quit my first job because it's part of my financial aid (work study). I don't want to quit my second job because it's the only thing I enjoy even a little out of the main three (2 jobs and school). I can't drop out of school because I'd lose financial aid and screw up any future I still have a chance at. I don't even see a future right now. I cannot imagine myself alive next week, let alone in 5 years. I don't have the time or energy or desire for therapy. I don't need to waste hours of my week spilling my guts (something else I cannot do) and hearing someone tell me, ""Think positive! It gets better! Mindfulness!"". I can't tell anyone or talk to anyone other than my SO. The only other choice I can see for myself going forward is suicide. I attempted once before when I was with my ex and failed miserably because I didn't do any research. So. Yeah. Just a long rambling vent, I guess. I'm not even sure what I'm hoping to get out of it.

THe past 6 months drained all of my energy,"I just wanna get this off my chest as I have nobody I'm willing to talk to about thisI had to deal with health problems for a long time. 8 years to be exact. I wasn't able to go to school or work. I sat at home all day and played games. I lost a lot of friends, was depressed and had my first suicide thoughts.
This is fairly irrelevant now but it may help to understand why I feel the way I do right now.In august 2016 I was finally able to start my apprenticeship as I was able to get my health problems under control. I was able to work and go to school. I gained new friends and good things happened in life. By february/march I was happy with how things were going for the first time in 8 years.But then in april, one of my best friends died in a motorcycle accident. He lost control over his bike and hit an oncoming bus head-on. He died instantly. This put me into a big hole. My health problems started again, I started missing at work. Sometimes I was in the office maybe 1-2 days a month. I had to take medication to even make it to school. I felt like complete shit during that time but did not have any suicide thoughts yet because everything else was going well.During that time I lost contact to a girl I like a lot. I don't have a crush on her or anything, I just like her a lot as a person.

But my constant asking to talk annoyed her a lot. I could sometimes tell it did especially cause I knew she wasn't doing too well herself at that time but I still asked because I was depressed, felt like shit and wanted to talk to someone, to her. She was the only person that could make me forget everything. Just before summer holidays we had a big falling out and we cut contact which made me feel even worse at first.I had 3 weeks of holidays in which I could relax and think a lot. It helped me forget everything and feel a lot better. But I couldn't forget her. So before going back to school, I texted her and we talked again. I told her the whole story hoping she'd understand why I acted like I did. I told her that I'm very sorry I was a burden to her in a time she had to deal with her own problems. I asked her if she could forgive me and give me a second chance. She said she'll think about it but 3 weeks later I know from a friend of her that she isn't really interested in keeping up contact with me anymore. I'm still in a big up and down rollercoaster from what happened in the past 6 months. Some days I feel great and the next day I think about how easy it would be to get rid of all my problems, to forget everything. I sometimes go days and weeks without being able to motivate myself for anything. I just wanna lay in bed all day and cry. But this with her, this is really the last straw for me. I have never met anyone who has such similar views about life and everything as I do. I really miss talking to her on the phone or just chatting all day long. I can't even put into words how much I regret everything I did. I wish I could undo it but I can't.I could never do it myself. I couldn't do it to my family, my friends and everyone around me. I know there will be better times eventually. I have everything I could ask for in life. But I'm almost hoping someone would run me over on my bike tomorrow and end my misery.Thank you for reading.

I'm feeling hopeless,"I don't really know how I ended up here, but I think I needed to find this. Basically, I've been depressed for a very long time. Since I was a kid, I felt sad all the time. My dad left when I was young and he's a bit of a dead beat so I never really see him and he's never been a part of my life. My mom started drinking to cope with losing him and the father of my half siblings, her husband who skipped the country and never came back. The drinking got pretty bad and increasingly worse since. I was bullied throughout primary school and some of secondary although the person who led it ended up becoming my best friend and had one of the most impressive and genuine character development I've ever seen. I got attacked by a guy when I was 14. He slapped my ass so hard that it left a bruise. pinned me down and felt me up. He tried to get us to play hide and seek, he'd taken my phone so I couldn't contact anyone and it was only recently that I realised he was trying to get me alone and I don't want to think about what for. Anyway, I refused which resulted in him bashing my head against a lamp post. Ever since then I've had horrible anxiety and my depression got a lot worse. After my first break up when I was fifteen, I started taking drugs to cope because I felt like everyone had let me down. Being so depressed caused me to lose a lot of my friends. Ecstasy was my drug of choice, but after a year I just stopped because it wasn't making me happy and that's all I really wanted. I started hurting myself too, which lasted a bit longer. I stopped going to school too, ended up leaving in my last year. I lost interest in everything I used to love. When I was a kid I used to cope by reading. It was something that took me to a different place when my mom drank herself into oblivion, and gave me an excuse not to think about putting her to bed after she'd passed out on the toilet, or on the kitchen table. I left home when I was 16, I moved in with my sister and my mom tried to take her own life because of what I did. So I moved back home, and that's where I've been since. Terrified to leave in case she hurts herself, no future in sight. I have nothing I want to do, nothing to aspire to. The idea of living the rest of my life stuck in a shitty job feeling the way I feel is overwhelming. I've been getting help on and off since I was fifteen and I've been steadily going for a year, and everything seemed like it was looking up but it's not. I have crippling self esteem issues, horrible anxiety and no will to live. I'm the closest I've ever been to taking my own life. I'm more serious about it than I've ever been. I tried to get anti depressants from my doctor today, kind of a last ditch effort to be happy but I guess she didn't believe me. So yeah, I think I'm going to take my own life.

My boyfriend is suicidal and I have no idea what to do,"We moved to different countries for university. We planned on breaking up but ended up staying in touch because we missed each other. The only contact we have now is IMs and occasional phone calls.He's had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, but at least back then I could go to his place and hold him or if we weren't together I could, I don't know, call his parents or something.I don't know what to do now. He's currently living with some family friends, but I've never met them. I don't know his new address. Part of me is starting to think that if living is so evidently painful for him, am I even in the right to stop him?I feel like I'm doing this so wrong, trying to get him to see that his beliefs about himself are completely misguided and make no sense. But I'm deathly scared that if he doesn't have someone in his life to get him out of that cycle of thoughts, it's only going to get worse. I desperately just want him to at least try therapy.He called a psychological counselling call-line type of thing, and when he told them that he doesn't really see a purpose in his life anymore the woman told him it's just a ""teenage"" issue. I went from being thrilled that he's trying to get help, to wanting to push a call centre employee off a bridge. He, on the other hand, was more or less unfazed. He insists that therapy would never help him.His suicidal comments get more serious every time we talk about it.

Hello SW,"I'll just dive right in to this.I've been contemplating suicide for almost two months now and plan on ending myself before the year ends. I've been struggling with depression for over a year now and was recently diagnosed with D.I.D., both of which have made my life a living hell. My parents are abusive, I feel further from my friends every day, collapsing into myself. Back in August my soulmate left me and ever since I've been plauged with PTSD-type flashbacks of when we were together. About a week ago I started hearing voices and hallucinating, I haven't gotten a diagnosis yet but I suspect it might be Schizophrenia. My health has been failing rapidly over the last few weeks, and every time I close my eyes I feel like I'm not here, like I don't exist. I don't see the point in going on and I don't care about wether there's an afterlife, and wether it's better or worse than life as is. I'm toxicly aggressive and it's ruined almost ever friendship I've ever been in. I just don't give a fuck about anyone or anything anymore. Not sure what prompted me to post this, but whatever. I'm not killing myself tonight, however I wish I had the courage to. If I had a gun I would have shot my brains out already. I've come to terms with the fact that at the end of the day all I'll be is another statistic and I would rather leave than give any more. I haven't told anyone in my life about my suicidal thoughts other than my shrink.

College is fine.
Internship in a department of my university is fine as well (I got lucky, 'cause the architecture field can be really harsh). But even on it, my mindset is in a place where I feel bad though the process of doing something and not succeeding, the calling out session that comes after and, even when I get praised over something, I don't really care. Whatever. I have no idea what I'm going to do after I graduate because I'm not sure, 4 years in, if I have the right skillset for architecture. And I don't think I can mentally and financially change my graduation at such stage. I've seen so many incredible people who deserves so much mor the title of ""architect"" that can do so much more than I ever could.I used to have a hard time opening to others while I was young due to insecurity. That developed to a stage where I get my fix of social accomplishments in my own world, in my head. Imagining traveling and dating. Sure, I have a nice and welcoming group of friends, open minded, the best people you could ask for. And yet I can't come out to them as gay because there's this cliff in front of me where I freeze and can't afirm myself. Oh, and I had unprotected sex and am on . So hey, I'm feeling even more shitty!And I'm progressively losing interest in things. I'm not caring about carrer anymore. I have a crush at college, which could really work. But I'm too tired to go through the dating process. So I imagine moments like holding hands and I'm done with the human affection part.I'm watching videos of families who lost someone to suicide. In the past, it was shocking to me, so it kinda got me away from this path. But every time I go back to them, I get more and more numb towards them. Everything is a drag.

I work from home so it's not like anyone would notice until the wife got home.Told her I really need a therapy visit but the earliest availability for the therapist is the same time she gets off at work.

I Feel Free,"I posted here earlier in the week about a recent suicide attempt, and I would like everyone who posts here to say good-bye or to share their anguish to read this so that they may be inspired by what has transpired in less than a week after a failed attempt.I know I'm not supposed to talk about methods, but it's relevant to my story and can give you hope as to when your ""better"" that everyone always says gets can happen. I was drinking an entire bottle of Jonny Walker as fast as I could to kill myself when in my drunken state I called up my best friend to tell him how I felt (maybe I was pussying out, maybe I was just drunk, at this point I'll never care.) He stayed on the line for over an hour with me to talk me down from the ledge, and so in the time I spent talking and not drinking, I didn't consume enough quickly enough to be lethal (it was a fucking monster of a hangover though) and I woke up the next day numb to the outside world. When I saw him again on Wednesday, he gave me a great big hug and a necklace that was given to him when he went through suicidal depression from his Unitarian church that turned his life around. On the necklace, it reads, ""what the caterpillar perceives as the end, to the butterfly is just the beginning."" Seeing the kind of support and effort my friend was giving just about tore me in half. When people tell you to think about your loved ones, it isn't to shame you into not doing it because of someone else's sake, it's because they want you to look at the people you can turn to for help. I never told a soul for the 9 long years I suffered from suicidal depression until I told him. I burdened myself with my demons because I don't like making my problem anyone else's, and so I played the part of Atlas, carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders when I didn't have to. I now understand that there are different ways of looking at things in life, like a phrase such as ""think of your loved ones,"" or the analogy between the caterpillar and the butterfly. We can look at every outcome in a negative, bleak way like our lives are over, or we can see it as an opportunity to start fresh and get back in the hunt, whatever it is we're hunting for. And if the hunt scares you, don't let it. Don't feed emotions that aren't worth feeding. If you suffer from social anxiety like I did, don't think about the rejection aspect that isn't even guaranteed with each encounter, think about the prospect of meeting new friends who might be as wonderful as my best friend, someone who will stand by your side as you walk down the most lonesome road known to mankind. Think of looking for a job in the most competitive labor market as the chance to find your calling in life. Think of a break-up in a long-term relationship as the chance to meet someone who won't leave you or you them.But what you need to know is that it all depends on you. You might not have to feed depression and sorrow and pain, but in order to feed a zest for life, an appreciation for nature, or general happiness, you need something to feed it with. Take me for example. I long for a relationship because I've never had one. I no longer feel despair over that fact, I instead make it my best effort to get what I want and I am excited for what I know will be around the corner, and there's nothing women love more than a confident man who's sure of himself. It will take hard work to present the best version of myself, but that's the one I want everyone to know; the one who smiles at every stranger I meet, the one who sits with people who eat their lunch alone, the one who is no longer afraid or ashamed of asking for help. And I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for reaching out for help and offering help to those who truly need it, because you're doing heavenly work.It's been a roller-coaster of a week for me, with some fucking nutty ups and downs, but I long for the ups nowadays, and I am willing to make it my life's work to reach out to those of you in need. I don't even have what I want out of life yet, and I already know I'm not going to attempt suicide ever again because of the future I can have if I put my best foot forward and add a little strut to my walk, humming Ripple by the Grateful Dead all along the way. Please heed my advice if it makes a modicum of sense to you, because I want all of you to get out of this hell we find ourselves in. I love you all, and I believe there are other people out there who value your life and want you to stick around. I'll be the president of your fan club if no one wants to join.

While I know that my life is a miracle, I can't help but think of suicide. I've been suffering from chronic depression forever. My life is an ocean of sadness, I always tried to keep on being positive when one day: it was raining, I was looking out the window, my boyfriend and I stayed home. We both took a day off from work. I was thinking of how lonely, sad, unfulfilled and hopeless I was feeling, despite being loved, despite having the perfect family, a really good-looking guy who loved me, good friends... but I still felt unfulfilled and empty. I broke up with him, that was the moment I gave up on my optimism, from that moment I became hard to be around, and our relationship ended. I still have my friends who are aware of my condition, they respect the fact that I'm not always in the right mood to try to have fun and go out, but I feel lonely... hopeless. Nothing keeps me happy. You know, life is a miracle yes, but sometimes one just runs out of resources for coping with the pain. Think of life like a business in this case: when there are no resources to keep it going, all you have to do is give up on it. I don't want to live anymore. Yesterday I spent my Saturday night at home, and I looked out of the window... I didn't jump because I didn't feel ready but the thought of it didn't really scare me at all, it was actually comforting. I think I'll do it in three months, I have a date, I won't regret '' shutting my business down ''.",A2,0.85,"The text indicates chronic depression, feelings of hopelessness, self-harm thoughts, and significant emotional distress despite external support systems.

My life so far.,"I can't reach out to anyone so I'm trying anonymity. This will be a long post. Writing this out might bring me solace of some kind. Twenty one years ago I was born to an alcoholic, pothead punk of a father and the mother who was suckered into the ""bad boy"" routine because her father was mayor and mother a teacher. My mother was nineteen, a freshman in college, my father, doing nothing with his life at the time. Before long my mother decided it would be best to drop out of school. Father was a mess, spent all his money on various drugs and alcohol. My very first memory I have, as far back as I can remember, is the hole in my entryway. My room was on the opposite side of our C shaped house, at the bottom right apex of the ""C."" Straight across the long hallway that lead past a bathroom, the den, the living room, kitchen, dining room, kitchen, and finally my parents room. There was two exits. One about 20 feet from my bedroom door, one about fifteen from my parents door. I remember my father coming home, and hearing my mother quietly whispering to him. I cracked my door open and stared down the long hallway to watch my father towering over my mother, probably drunk, high, maybe both. He was holding his head and she raised her tone slightly before smashing a hole about the size of my head into the entryway wall. She was quiet and went into her room. He followed shortly after. I never saw my father hit my mother, but I would see occasional bruises. She covered them well. I don't know how she felt, she tried to be positive to me. I was a very confused child. We lived in the middle of nowhere, deep in the woods, no religion, no church. It was just the three of us and the woods. My mother got a job from her father. It paid well and was enough to barely support us. My mother racked up a large amount of debt keeping the house afloat until my father was able to get his act together. I spent my time outside most of the time during the summers. Doing my best to avoid my father. He was very uncaring, but terrifying when angry. At this point, I'm five years old. My dad wouldn't quite hit me, he'd chase me down the hall to my room until I fell over and cried. My mother would scold him, but he held himself together due to my age. The nights were filled with my night terrors. I had very vivid dreams my whole life. Still do.I had a baby brother by the time I was six, and a sister shortly after. I didn't realize how different things were until I lost the title of ""only child."" Fast forward to fourteen. We were moving from my small C shaped home in the woods to the town me and my siblings went to school in. My father hit me regularly by this point, but I'd rather not dwell on it. By this point my father was very cold and unreceptive to my attention. I was to blame. I messed up their twenties. I didn't really believe those words, just kind of thought them in the back of my head. Most of my childhood I spent avoiding my parents, exploring the woods since my parents lost all interest in me by the time I was able to be independent and I had siblings. After we moved, the money tensions rose drastically. My mother lost her empathy and had a very short temper. She wouldn't hit me, just scream. About three months after we moved in, I got in an argument with my father while I was doing the dishes and he choked me and stuck my head into the water. My mother screamed at him and I tried my best to retain my composure. My dad took off in the car, a regular occurrence by age 14. My mother was crying by the door and when I came by to apologize she screamed at me, unloading 14 years of stress onto my shoulders. How she racked up so much debt and couldn't be independent. How I ruined her marriage, her dreams, her chances, her life by being born. I left the house.I came back about a week later. I spent some time with my best (and only) friend. We'll call him Brad. Brad was tall and skinny, blonde hair and green eyes. Charismatic, quick witted, and egotistical. He was a leader, and I was his follower. We met in band class in the 8th grade and were best friends from day one. We raised hell together. He was popular and knew how to word everything perfectly to make the best of the situation. Our freshman year he dated the head cheerleader and sat with the rest of the seniors. He was that guy. I lived in his shadow. He always came back for me, though. We were like blood.After regaining my confidence he planted the seeds of independence in my mind. For the next four years of my life, I spent my life locked away and isolated from my family. They watched movies without me, ate dinner without me, and went out without me. Lived without me. It was almost a nuisance seeing me walk through the door after getting out of school. They'd scream at everything and anything. I just gave up and hid in my room as soon as I got home so they couldn't yell. I started my first job at 15, and worked as much as possible. I like to think I'm intelligent, but never felt school was the place to make my mark. I stayed quiet, living in Brad's shadow and trying to accumulate real world experience. I spent so much time living in my own head I never really looked outward to others. When I finally did, everything was an analytical act. Attempting to emulate Brad. The first case was with a girl I met in 8th Grade. Her name will be Faith. Faith had a lot of... Well.. Faith. Her family was poor and close knit, incredibly religious. She took a liking to me. She had bobbed dark hair, dark eyes, a tight cut hourglass waist, wide hips, and tits the size of my head. My adolescent self was completely intrigued. We talked on the phone daily. This continued throughout the school year until the summer came. I was excited to finally be able to spend time with my girlfriend and spend some of the money I had saved from working on someone. She told me she had to spend the summer up north with some family. We still talked daily, and it was good for me. Talking. Broke me out of my shell. She finally came back at the end of the summer, during our small town's fair. I waited all night for her.
She was there, with someone else. I gave up on women for a short time and tried to focus on work. That winter, at a parade, I ran into another young girl who I had never seen before. Short, with long black hair. Skinny, but curvy, with beautiful eyes and an amazing smile. We ran into each other crossing the road and just clicked. I repeated the process, calling her daily and staring to feel something for myself again. Summer came, and I was ready to finally spend my free time with her. She moved to North Dakota.
I waited a year, still calling her every day. Her parents eventually divorced and she moved back with her mother, at the time of the fair. I spent half the night waiting for her, and she showed up with her friend, who left shortly after. I felt alive every moment I spent alone with her. I was so happy. I finally felt normal. We wandered around the town after the fair and started a fire in some random persons fire pit. We pulled up lawn chairs and stared at the stars. I held her hand. I felt so alive. We kissed, and she told me that she slept with her abusive ex the day before I saw her, and the guilt was too much, through her tears. I stood up and walked home without saying anything. I didn't want to let myself get any more attached. That woman threw me for a loop of self harm and loathing myself for about a year. Things were still terrible at home, but I tried to keep any interactions to a minimum between school and work. I left whenever I felt like it. They didn't care where I was or what I did. I was like a ghost. The fall after that fair, during the beginning of the year, I met someone. Not necessarily someone.. More ""the one."" Brad had a friend he used to live by, who we'll call Alex. Alex's  parents owned a popular restaurant in town. He picked me and Brad up in this new car his parents bought him, and he brought some girl he liked with a bunch of her friends to this dance. No one was really going with anyone, but it was obvious who was into who. Everyone slid off into dances after we got there, except me, Brad's friend, and her. The one. ""J."" Alex asked her to dance, she refused. He stomped off into the crowd, and we sat at the table and talked. I managed to get her number and a (short and uneventful) dance. Fast forward to the deep fall. I called J up spontaneously after about a month of silence and asked if she wanted to go for a walk around town. Ironically, J lived a block behind me and one house over. We wandered through town, watching the leaves fall, telling each other the deepest thoughts we had. She asked if I wanted to watch this illusionist event that was going on that night, to which I eagerly accepted. The event was interesting until the magician started using magic as a metaphor for Christianity, to which I lost a large portion of my interest. She mumbled something about how lame it turned out, which was eye opening in such a religious conservative area that we were born. We became super close. We dated for about a year before a mutual break. That year, I focused on my work, senior year. I had an internship and two jobs outside of school and was attending a skill center for business management. Brad called me on my way home from work and told me that Alex and J were dating. I hung up without a word. I spent some time thinking, and thought maybe it was for the best. She was perfect, but that's not something to concern myself with. I just tried to stay friends. Support my best ""girl friend."" Alex had anger issues. He reminded me of my father. The ""bad boy"" who was spoiled, with lots of money. They ended up breaking up after he tried to pressure her into sex. He followed her everywhere, even smashed in a locker at school when she ghosted him. I tried to support her, and got her back on her feet. Not long after, she started dating an older guy from the town over. I was constantly invited to parties by J, hosted by her boyfriend. Brad had faded into the popular crowd and lost connection with me. So, in hopes of having a social life, I followed. At this point in my life my parents rarely spoke, in passing. I got a call from my mother while I was at my internship. My grandmother had died of cancer. She was sick for three years, and married to the inspiration of my life (grandfather), and the most kind woman I've ever met. The nightmares still haven't stopped to this day. She was the light in the darkness of my family tree. Compassionate, caring, always listening. What I imagine ""family"" is supposed to feel like. My grandfather started seeing another woman about a year after. I can't look at him the same.After she started college, J and Alex broke up. Distance, she said. He didn't look at her the same. I fell back in love with her and confessed everything to her. She came back every weekend to see me. Things were good. I graduated at 17 and was accepted to a nearby university to hers, for mechanical engineering. I was convinced to become independent and finally sever the dead ties with my family. Be my own person, build my own life. On my 18th birthday, we both lost our virginity. J was that girl that comes by once in a lifetime. She spoke softly and compassionately. She was so supportive and kind. She was perfect in every way. The perfect girlfriend. We ended up growing slightly apart due to my engrossing in school. She cheated on me. Or, that's how it felt. We were taking ""a break"" and she started seeing someone else. I quit school and took a production welding job at a factory my aunt was a human resources manager at, bought a 2010 Ford focus, bought and furnished an apartment in our hometown, and rekindled the fire between us. That was the biggest mistake of my life. She lived with me on the weekends, went to school during the week. I worked 80 hours a week, made great money, but had no time. I worked with some less than classy people. I got into Vicodin and started drinking as much as I could get. Smoking constantly. I went downhill fast. My temper shortened, and spent time at home during the weekends sleeping as soon as I got there. My body was exhausted. She still tried to be kind. I think I felt like I had it all, that she was there for good, so I vented onto her once. Unloaded. Things got worse. The Vicodin warped to pill popping. Things worsened. I came into work when it was dark, and left when it was dark. After constant fighting about 8 months into the new job, I drive my car head on into a semi at 70. I didn't even break anything. I blew it off and blamed it on a semi swerving into my lane. I bought a pistol from a sketchy friend for $325. I went into the woods where my old home was and planned on killing myself in a drunken, angry, confused stupor. J called. Told me how great her day at college was. How she helped these kids (early education major). Her voice was filled with love. I put the gun away. I know I was fucked up because when she came home and found the gun she kept asking if I would hurt myself, or her. I always denied it sharply. She didn't know about my car. Eventually I got in an argument with my supervisor and quit that day. J stayed with me until the power went out in my apartment. I kept making excuses. Lying. So many lies. She left and we fought, and then I was alone. I tried to do it so many times, tried to end it. We had done everything together, and I selfishly built my life around her. I was hopeless.
After about five months of turmoil I got a job as a maintenance person/toolmaker at a nearby factory. I got my shit together, quit all the pills and drinking, and really tried to do things right. I coaxed her back again. Things were perfect. I made her family dinner. That's when she told me they would never trust me after the last four years. I was taken aback. It got to the point where it was me or them. She chose them. She called me crying in June and told me it was over. I haven't seen her since. She deleted and blocked me on all social media. I never see her anymore. The only thing I had was a casual dress she left here. I left it on her parents doorstep about a month ago.I kept thinking I'd be fine, and even dated another girl a few months later. I took her out to dinner and we got drunk in Canada. It's a long story. Good time. She moved across state. I left her. It was for the best. My life slowly fell back apart. I started to realize how alone I was when Brad moved to South Carolina. After we graduated I spent every waking moment of free time I could with that bastard, and now he was leaving. It's been a few months. My apartment is trashed. I don't necessarily feel like I need J or Brad to feel whole, but I've been steadily feeling more and more empty. I was just told last week that I have a month to find a new job. My car died. I'm $5,000 or so in debt from the five months I wasn't working after quitting production welding. I have $158.47USD to my name. I'm feeling alone and helpless, so empty. I haven't spoken with anyone outside of work in months. The one person I went through everything with is gone, and my best friend is gone. The one family member I had is dead. My nights are filled with night terrors. I've lost 40lbs. I can't reach out anymore, I'm going crazy inside my head, Brad won't even respond to my texts. He's moved on. I wish I could.

I've managed to push everyone away and now I'm all alone,"I've recently separated from the military (no deployment) and I've been struggling with the transition back to a normal life.

"Less empathy for ""scary"" mental illnesses","I've noticed that the majority of sympathy towards"" those with mental illness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression and/or anxiety, as opposed to those with chronic depression, chronic suicidal thoughts, treatment-resistant depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. While I'm by no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters, I am sick and tired of people with mild, easily-treatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go through.Take self-harm for example. If you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes. Feel sad because you can't get a job? Have a little empathy. Hear voices? See things that aren't there? Always angry? You're difficult. You're a burden. You're an emotional vampire, you're an energetic drain. You're a toxic person beyond helping. Feel a little bit anxious? Here, have a bit of empathy. Can't leave the house because you feel like you're dying? Can't keep a job because social interactions make. I'm so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured, almost fully-functioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldn't die. No one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday. No one likes it when you're clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you don't off yourself. I struggle from an eating disorder. I make cuts in my skin. I'm always suicidal, I'm glad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed, by mine AREN'T. My problems rule my life, and they're something I'll struggle with FOREVER, they color every part of my life.

I took a week off in July and without the overtime I took such a financial hit I almost couldn't buy food- and I didn't even do anything or go anywhere, it was literally just a staycation where I mostly played video games or went on walks to the park. I'm 31 with a college degree and I have to get a second job and essentially work 7 days a week so I can save money. I have no life now because I can't afford it. I'll have no life then because I won't have time. And it is an endless cycle. I am tired. I feel heavy. Air hurts. My skin feels raw. And as much as I want to feel guilty, I can only feel at peace in the knowledge that sometime soon I will die and I will be the one to do it. That when it is over everyone else will be sad but eventually they will move on. They'll get on with their lives, and I will no longer be the fuck-up burden they feel obligated to invite places or required to talk to. They won't have me to support financially and emotionally. What I hope to gain is freedom, and I hope to provide it as well. I do not like who I am. I am not happy. I have not been happy for a very long time. I have always been unsuccessful in relationships. I try so many things and can barely rise to mediocrity. And when people say I'm good at something or they like me it just feels like a lie. It feels like they are making fun of me. It always has felt that way. And I'm tired. And I just want to be done now.

A letter to myself.,"Dear Self.You like to think that your problems began on Christmas Eve, of the year 1993 when you were raped, beaten and strangled. You were a seven year old boy then. The truth of the matter is is that the problems began shortly after conception. That genetic mishap that was placed inside your genetic sequencing, that ticking time bomb that inevitably went off at the age of fourteen, when you tried to commit suicide for the first time. You stole your father's pistol from his closet, loaded it, and pressed it to your temple. It failed to fire because your father was a failure at maintaining his guns properly. Strangely, upon remembering this, I seem to find it a fitting metaphor for how you have turned out. While your father was a failure at maintaining his guns, you have become the same failure at maintaining personal relationships, your work duties, your own fatherly responsibilities. All of which have led to other suicide attempts, which predictably, have ended in failure. These are only a few of the many fuckups you have endured in your thirty-one years in life. You have subsequently shown that you are incapable of interacting with people like a normal human being. Remember that night where you became everything you ever hated, and attempted to rape that guy? Another failed suicide attempt followed that little endeavour. You vowed to give up sex after that altogether, swearing to become a better person. You failed at that as well. Instead, you married the person you slept with next. Sired two children. They may love you dearly, but she hates you. You know she does. The way she glares at you when she thinks you're not looking. The fact she now refuses to sleep in the same bedroom as you, and becomes physically sick if you touch her, The fact you're on the road many weeks at a time providing a pathetic excuse for a living for her and your two kids. For fuck sakes, the power has been turned off more times than you can count because you can't make enough money to keep it on. You've failed as a provider. You have failed as a husband. You failed at Marriage.Worst of all, you've failed at being a good father.You've missed so much. Your son's first words and steps. Your daughter's first days of First, second, and third grade. You're worse than your father ever was, and HE had the audacity to call you a liar when you cried to him after being raped. You're fucking worthless. Look at you. Self medicating in alcohol and weed, masturbating twice a day constantly chasing that temporary high that will ultimately take the crushing weight of having fucked up every good thing that could have possibly come your way.To your credit, you'd never change your children. They're the only thing that gives you hope. But maybe... just maybe... they'd be happier if you weren't around. One less white trash, confused bisexual dad in the world to screw them up forever and ever couldn't hurt that much, could it? I mean, look at yourself. You're deeply unhappy. You're mentally scarred, terrified of everything, barely able to take care of yourself. Ultimately, you will die alone, some nurses' or doctor's burden that they'd be annoyed to be obligated to try and help. You're growing older, fatter, sadder, and yet still hold steadfast to the desperate need to try and hide from all of this.That's why I needed to write this letter. This post for everyone to see. You've been considering ending it again. Possibly taking someone with you. Despite the treatments for your steadily declining mental health, you find yourself back in the depths of the darkness and it's far worse than it ever has been before. Violent urges, thoughts of self harm and suicide, all of these things are piling up on you like an avalanche and you feel as though there is no one to talk to. No one cares to listen anymore because you're such a fucking crybaby about your mental problems. It's cost you so many friends and even family members. Your wife won't even bother to listen to you anymore. You are truly alone in the darkness and it is consuming you this time, your inner demons finally winning out despite a decade of fighting like hell against them. You could tell your doctor about it, but he's already certain the medication that you're on is THE THING that will make you normal again.As if you were ever normal. I really don't know how to end this letter. I guess things like this don't ever end. I'll always be that voice in your head, criticizing you, telling you what you already know about yourself but refuse to acknowledge, baring the truth in all it's naked glory for you to try and shy away from. I will be with you until the end. Which needs to come sooner, rather than later.

Please hear me out,"This is my first time on this subreddit, but I think is time for me to seek help. (Before going on, please read everything, I know It's long but I really need someone to hear me out).I'm currently a 20 yo male, so I'll start writing from the beginning.
It all started back when I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend whose name was Fred. Fred was always there for me and he was a great friend for pretty much all my life. He bid farewell when I was 17, needless to say, I cried all that day.My first episode with depression was back when I was 14 I think, I got expelled from my previous school and entered a new one (I had a lot of behavioural isssues back then), so I felt abandoned and like I had betrayed the friends I had; not only that, I aso felt I disappointed my mother (this was the second time I was expelled).But Fred tried to cheer me up! He did his best so I wouldn't be sulky all day long, and I even met a guy (he was the first persona I talked to in that school) and was really happy for the first time! I thought everything would get better from then.However, the next day I went to school, I didn't find that guy anywhere. Needless to say, I felt devastated. Had I done something wrong? Did I scare him somehow? All those doubts were bugging me back then. Some years later, I found him again (I met other people and made new friends while looking for him), and asked him why he had disappeared. He told me he didn't like our classmates, so he changed his classroom (he felt terrible when I told him how I felt, to this day, he still feels bad for what he did. But I've got no grudges against him).So, I was all alone during my first year at that school. With the exception of that single kid, I didn't get along with anyone else, so that year I was friendless. I used to help my arts teacher do some works during the breaks, so I wouldn't be alone all day long (I learnt the hard way the value of human interaction), otherwise, I would be reading in the hall (I've done this since I was a kid).One day, I was unbearably sad, so I didn't feel like eating anything, also, you had to go to the dining hall so you could have lunch, and I skipped lunch for a whole week, cause I didn't want to go alone in there and be seen as a weirdo (I was an idiot, I know).So I stopped eating for that week, got some nasty hunger pangs and ate as much as I could when I got home, I also ate a lot during the weekends, so my mom became suspicious. One day, I was feeling really, really hungry, since waking up, so I ate my snacks. It eased the hunger pangs for a while, but during spanish class (that teacher really liked me), I passed out.I obviously don't remember everything, I was sitting in my desk and lost consciousness. Next thing I remember, everyone was standing by my side, looking at me, someone went for stretcher, and they carried me to the school's nursery.I stayed there for a long while, and when I got out, another teacher that really liked me (I'm still indebted to her, if you're reading this, thank you), greeted me. She began asking me questions, beating around the bush until she told me: ""So you say you've been eating well, but I can prove otherwise"". She showed me a list they used, which they checked when you entered the dinig hall. I didn't have a single check.She said she wouldn't tell my parents (I begged her not to), if I went to eat everyday, I agreed and to this day, my parents don't know about that incident.Fast forwarding to college life.I decided to study medicine, and entered college when I was 17. Everything was fine, I still was sad cause of Fred's departure (he left when I was 17, remember). But I was really happy for the change of environment.Until one day... I was having lunch at the dining hall, and saw a guy; who I thought was cute, but said: ""Hey it's fine, you can find other people attractive, doesn't mean you're gay"". I was wrong, I had a crush on that guy (I still kind of have to this day).I was really confused back then, so I experimented with a different guy who liked me (I didn't reciprocate though). It was a terrible idea, not only I felt bad for him, I was struggling with my sexuality, and that triggered another depressive episode.Last year, I finally came out to myself as bisexual. I decided I needed to move on (the guy I like has a boyfriend and has been with him for 2 years I think), so I decided to talk to him.

Recent thoughts of suicide and talking to someone about it,"Hey. I've always ignored how much I thought about suicide in the past. Most recently I decided to pay attention and ended up realizing that I think at least a couple times a day what would life be without me; how the life of my loved ones would move forward, which way I'd choose to go.My family is very strict about this subject ��� my uncle commited suicide about 11 years ago and almost no one ever talked about it ��� and talking to them about what I'm feeling will just cause unnecessary pain and concern.On the other hand, I've been with this girl for the past 8 months and it's been great. We've never talked about depression or suicide specifically but I've mentioned a few times how fucked up my life was/can be. Having her around is great and, honestly, one of the few things that I really enjoy lately, though she's gonna study abroad for a year (yeah, that's messing me up a bit, but anyway).I just wanna know if I should talk to her about it and how I can do it so that she doesn't feel guilty.

I DO NOT see a good reason to continue living,"I'm 22 with a good degree and no student debt, I'll probably land a stable job with good pay within the next few months, I have basically all the material comforts I want, but I still haven't been happy since I was 18.

College - the best chance I had to make friends and build a social life - has passed me by. I have no personality. I'm a timid bundle of nerves. From where I'm at now, it's hard to imagine ever meeting someone who's interested in me for more than a week.

"Thoughts on suicidal ""impulses"" that aren't always associated with actual feelings of sadness, despair, etc.","I'm wondering if anyone else tends to experience this because I haven't really seen it discussed anywhere before.  Obviously when I'm experiencing particularly strong bouts of depression and feeling hopeless I dwell on thoughts of ending my life.  Outside of that, the rest of the time, though, I still have these like ""impulses"" or ""urges"" that seem completely disconnected from my mood or feelings.  Like, walking across a bridge, not thinking about anything wrong with my life, not experiencing anything that could be related to ""sadness"" or ""unhappiness"" or anything like that, sometimes I can even be really happy or upbeat at the time, but I'll still feel this strong drive or draw towards the water, like a magnetic pull towards the railing.  I ended up moving residences because I had to walk across a bridge to get to work from my old place and I wasn't sure I could trust myself forever.  Likewise with freeways, train platforms, the presence of firearms or strong pills, stuff like that.  I become pre-occupied with their presence and it's hard to concentrate on other things as my mind keeps drifting back towards that ""opportunity"".  It's not like when I'm going through a period of depression where I think about ending my life as an ""escape"" or because ""life isn't worth living"" or anything like that.  It almost feels like I'm considering the act just on it's own, for no reason at all. Just to do it, just because I can. Like the urge to scratch a mosquito bite or step on a sidewalk crack.

I tell her the things (how I battled through depression for many years) but all the time she said she really wants to go back to watching the tv show she was watching (project runway) I barely talk to her for 8 minutes (it took me 25 minutes to drive there) and I say what I needed to tell her and she says we should hang out this weekend and she will text me later. So far no text.The next day I get a call from my cousin. Her mother, my aunt died. I was not close to them because there is an age gap of 15 years as well as infighting between my parents and theirs. But I am the intermediary and go to talk to my cousins. I went Wednesday night for 7 hours talking to one cousin. And I went today talking to the other cousin. But today was emotionally draining. My uncle is telling me everything wrong with my father and what he did while I just sat there nodding occasionally while allowing him to talk about him and my father. There are times I wanted to call out his shit but his wife of 50 years just died and I can't. So I sit there for at least 4 hours of belittlement while I am pretty sure my relationship to the friend prior is over over.....I want to cry but I cannot. I am so numb though, its somewhat like when my brother died. Actually my older cousins asked for advice from me because they knew I went through it. It is very weird telling your mid 40's cousins how to prepare for a funeral that you are well antiquated with. What to do, what to buy, which casket to buy, burial plot, etc.I am just stretched so thin. I am somewhat certain that if I asked the friend to come she would but the way she is acting I do not want to bring a ""friend"" to my family's funeral. I do not think I ever want to talk to her because clearly project runway is more important that silly me needing me to tell her my problems. It seems to me that she is a taker and will not give back anything. On top of the monetary things she said she would pay me back or. Or the other things.The saving grace this week that is making me look forward, I also got a phone call from the blood donation company that I matched perfectly with a infant that needs my white blood cells.

I'm here again. Feeling the weight of guilt and the pain of realization.,"I've had a rough couple of years. It started with an unknown illness.

I got sicker and sicker and lost my job.Tried to start a business, and I am failing at that. Failing badly. I've ghosted on a client - I feel awful. I feel guilty. I don't know how to recover that relationship.I've been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit 3 times in the last 9 months - twice involuntary. Suicide attempts have fucked with my heart. It's hard to tell if I am feeling ill because of mental illness, or a physical illness, or a suicide attempt, or all of the above. The red pin-prick rashes on my feet and back tell me I'm not crazy, but doctors could never confirm an auto-immune disorder. Some days I am completely bed-ridden and can't function at all because of pain. So here I am again, considering suicide. There's nobody to catch me as I'm falling. If I can't make rent, I'm homeless. If I can't make money, my marriage is down the tubes. It's hard to see your dreams fade away as you desperately try to get healthy to no avail.

I'm just tired of being myself,"I'm tired of still struggling with my weight. I am very morbidly obese, like hitting the 500 lbs mark. It's the usual cycle of ""I feel bad so I eat which makes me feel worse so I eat etc..."" My weight has just climbed. I've used it to push people away, to bottle up my emotions. When I was 18 I was very close to killing myself but I didn't. Tonight I regret it because then all those years wouldn't have happened and I wouldn't have so much failure on my shoulders. I'm so ashamed of myself that I can't live. I push away my friends because I'm afraid to see that ""damn she's big"" expression on their face. I lost my job last year and I've been afraid to look for one because of how disgusting I look. I went to school to get a better career but my weight poses a serious roadblock. My mom gave me a box of chocolate donuts the other day and it really hurt me. It was a weird reaction I guess. I'm probably reading too much into it but I couldn't help but feel that she's given up on me. I'm fat and a failure so here's some donuts for you. I don't have anyone to dump this on so here I am on the internet to at least vent a bit. Everyone around me seems to have a healthy relationship with their own life, how can I poison it with my crap? Every night I hope my heart gives out and I just never wake up. Believe me, I lift out of my family's life so easily. They'll be sad for a bit but then there'll be a relief that the anchor around their neck is gone. One thing that scares me is surviving my attempt. It would be my luck to end up worse than ever. I have tried to lose weight. Sometimes I feel like a drug addict that's trying to resist their next fix but end up giving in. Why is it that good people die and pieces of shit like me get to live????? Sometimes I wish I'd get mugged so that the decision would be taken out of my hands. I'm so sick of myself and I don't know what to do! I need help to just get through a moment in my skin. I avoid a mirror as much as possible. My sister just had a baby, my first nephew.

I'm ashamed sharing that thought it's so stupid. I really don't know why anyone should care but this is my message in a bottle, so to speak. I'm overwhelmed and I don't know what to do anymore.

It's getting harder and harder for me to justify living,"I'm not normalI'm self-conscious I have low self-esteemI can't make friendsI have no friends and the only contacts in my phone book are my mom, grandmother, brother, and step-dad. But the only one I talk to regularly is my momI can't talk to people in real time it terrifies me - I can't do it on the phone, I can't do it through text, I can't do it through micI can't go to crowded places because I think everyone will look at me because I'm alone
I can't cross streets because I think everyone is staring at meI can't eat alone because I think everyone is staring at meI can't exercise because I think everyone is staring at meI can't go to buffet style restaurantsI can't eat alone because I think I'll stand out and because of this I haven't even gone to my college's cafeteria because I don't know how it works and I'm too scared to ask how it works at this point and I haven't really eaten because of itI've tried to think about what made me this way and I've pointed to a few reasons - being bullied up to high school, my mom being a lot meaner and unstable before she got on medication and met my step-dad, being compared to my brother by everyone before we went to different schools, and being ignored by family because they favored him more.
But I'm also aware that those happened in the past and I should work to try to fix the problems they caused rather than blame everyone else for my own inability to fix the problemsI know how to fix the problem - I start small by crossing streets or something similar and once I get used to that.I try something else like small talk with a stranger or classmate and just tell myself ""Who cares if they think you're weird!"" if I get nervousThen I move onto getting their number if things go well. Maybe I text them or they text me maybe the same day or maybe tomorrow who knows.
Then we get closer and ask each other out once in awhile and then I made a friendIf I do it enough I'll get comfortable with it and then I will be able to make more friends and even a girlfriend and I'll be partway to a dream I had since I was a child: becoming a husband, father, and a teacher that everyone could admireI thought going to college would be able to fix all of my problems because it's a new place and I researched this for a really long time, but it didn't I am too scared to do anything. I haven't even went to the
cafeteria yet because I don't know how to use it I thought I'd be able to make friends at a party the college hosted on move-in day, but everyone was already in a group or paired up, so I wasn't able to work up the courage to talk to anyone and left quickly
I don't understand how everyone was able to make friends so quickly. I hear people talk outside my window having fun and talking with friends and it makes me feel like a complete life because I'm not doing that even though I want to
I'm thinking of going to a club fair tomorrow, but I probably won't do that either knowing meI've been on multiple anti-anxiety pills and I've been in therapy since I was 8 or 9 and I done both for 10 years.
My mom swears up and down that they worked, but I told her they didn't and she even admitted at one point that they made me more ""Zombie"" likeMy mom and brother try to help me, but they just get frustrated and annoyed when it doesn't work out and
then they yell (raising their voices in their own words) at me when I say I knew it wouldn't work and I know
how to solve all of my problems and it's a me problem at this point and if I can't do it then it doesn't matter
how often you yell at me or give me suggestions or just give me the horrible (""JUST DO IT"") motto even though I've said time and time again that it's horrible and it's a lot harder than that for meIt just isn't working because I'm in the equation. It's all because of meI know it will take a couple of months to fix all of this, but I can't do it. I can't work up to courage to talk to people, I can't get it into my head that most people aren't looking at me and judging my every move and I can't get it into my head that most people will probably forget about me in a couple of hours
Instead my mind loops to all of the negative thoughts and outcomes and I get reminded about how scared I am of people
I remember back to stuff I read online the last time I talked about this: I only want a girlfriend/wife because I want sex, I can't even cross a street so I'm beyond help, I have low-self esteem because I'm biracial and I'm pracitally a mutt, and many other things which make me question myself and makes me even more scared of talking to people I already am scared of talking toI've been thinking about suicide a lot since New Years lately and I finally told my brother and mom when my brother came back from college and before I left for college and all my brother does is punch me and say don't say that. My mom's the same way when I talk about suicide, but instead gets mad and says never talk about that again. There are only three things stopping me from committing suicide really My cat who is almost 13 at this point and the fact someone told me I wouldn't be happy if I killed myself because I wouldn't be able to feel happiness. And the possibility of things getting better and finally achieving my dreamHowever those things are becoming less and less of a suicide stopper because I know even if I die my family will take care of my cat and the fact that I realized I wouldn't be able to feel sadness if I died either. Researching the problem doesn't helpAsking for help doesn't helpMedicine doesn't helpPeople can't help meI can't help myself anymore and I really am reaching the final straw at this point.

How do I get help from friends without seeming like a complete jackass?,"I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and am splitting really hard recently. People are either my friends or they hate me; I am either full of confidence and hope- which is fine most of the time- or I just want to kill myself for tanking so low so fast and suddenly feeling like a massive shitheap of a worthless person.I am living with friends currently, but they're much more like close family than just friends- for all the love, we bicker a lot; we've been through a lot and are very forgiving, but on the day-to-day we're all always finding fault among the others. This is not to say we are in any way mean or bad people, we just each expect better of the others among us (and are quick to admit our own flaws, as well).The problem, lately, has been that I am severely depressed because of other outside circumstances (err, almost being murdered by my now-ex on 6/1), and this petty bickering always leaves me feeling like I can do no right. It doesn't matter that two hours ago they were thanking me for responding to their kid in danger, the fact that they're chiding me now for [whatever] is extremely upsetting and the sheer level of upset makes me want to hurt myself [punch myself in the head, usually] and then that stupid impulse makes me angry enough to want to kill myself and then I get stuck in a loop of being angry at myself for being so oversensitive and overdramatic about something so stupid.I need help, and I'm not even sure how anyone can help and I don't know how to ask without seeming like a total attention-seeking ass, or even if there is a response like ""What can we do to help?"" and I'm like ""I don't know"" and I'm back to looking like an ass. I'm not very prideful but, you know, I already kind of feel crappy and so putting myself out there to feel crappier for a minute even if to feel better later is just... I don't know how to do it, other than ""just do it,"" which is so awful I loop back around to the ""this sucks so much I want to kill myself"" feeling over something that objectively shouldn't be that hard.I imagine killing myself in many ways, but I don't know that I could go through with any of them. Just the pain of enduring basic, everyday scenarios is becoming excruciating, and I feel like I'm getting worse rather than better, no matter what I try to do to turn it around.I sought professional help and he recommended DBT, but that takes time to get into and right now every day is getting worse.Any advice out there?",A3,0.9,"The text indicates severe emotional distress, self-harm ideation, and a recent traumatic event (almost being murdered).

How do I help my friend?,"Sorry if this is long.So, during lunch break at school today, I saw my friend, and I went up to him to say hi.  He didn't say hi back and I asked what was wrong.  He straight up said to me that he was depressed and wanted to commit suicide.  So we walked around the school during break.  I found out that his father died when he was young.

You can even see the scars on his body from the beatings he got from his mother; his brother is a witness.  People never believed him when he said he was abused and depressed, which caused it to get worse.  He said he is to the point where he doesn't think there's no hope.  He doesn't believe in God.  The air force was the place he wanted to go to because it would be a quick death.  His older brother died in the army.  He tells me that everyday, he holds a gun to his head and thinking about pulling the trigger.  He has a quick temper and has done some bad things in the past.  No one understands him and all the younger kids thinks he's cool because of the things he does.  If someone pulled a gun on him, he wouldn't flinch.  He said that, on his 18th birthday, that he was going to shoot himself in front of his mother.  I just don't know what to do.

Why try?,"I�۪ve always been a pretty ���gifted�۪ kid, as far as most aspects go. I excelled in most classes aside from math from an early age, was pretty articulate even as a toddler, and used to genuinely enjoy learning before all of the enjoyment was sucked out of it by the pressure on me. My mom�۪s always held me to a standard of A�۪s and B�۪s only (even a C is failing in her book), and now I�۪m not meeting it. I�۪ve got too much work and I get it done, but I want to relax too. I don�۪t want to be doing something educational 24/7, because I�۪m too burnt out by the time I get home. I�۪m trying to bring my grades up, but I just can�۪t do it, and now my mom�۪s cold as ice to me and is taking away basically everything that gives me any sort of relief from the constant stress. She knows I�۪ve got depression and anxiety (both actually diagnosed), and she knows how she treats me isn�۪t helping at all, but she just doesn�۪t care. She says it�۪s all because she wants me to succeed, but if feeling like my own mother hates me and that I�۪ll never be good enough and having constant mental breakdowns and suicide attempts because of my failed attempts to meet her standards is what it takes to succeed, then I don�۪t want to. Why even bother if I�۪ll fail anyways? Why even bother trying to live a life that makes me wish I were dead? The only thing that�۪s really kept me here for almost 16 years is the thought of my friends and family, but I don�۪t care anymore.

Suicide option is liberating,"I know this sounds odd, but it was so liberating when I determined that suicide was a realistic option for me.

Been feeling EMPTY inside for 10+ years and Depressed,"Well, i want to start out with brief about what all happened to me and i kinda feel like shit ever since 2008. When a triple-tragedy struck me. I have never spoken about any of this to anyone, let alone the internet. this is my deep feelings and thoughts who i wanted to share with someone who can come up with answersbefore 2008, I was a really happy, crazy and adventurous person. And i studied in england from 1999 to 2005. After that period i came back to my home country and met an amazing women in 2006 and we instantly fell over each other. Everything was going great between me, her and everything was exception in my life, like my business, my adventures and excursions and everything i could ever ask for. I smoked, drank, partied and above all, went to long nature trips in mountains and hills. I don't know how it started but my women & me started having a few problems over getting married. She was insisting on quick marriage, and i wanted more time thinking we were still young and everything fell apart and fights happened. Then i found out few weeks later that she was sleeping with someone else and i legit felt suicidal and even tried to twice. ( this was 2007-late) i kept crying man-tears for 6 months, had panic and anxiety attacks at night and i was literally losing 5-10 KG weight between that period.And then in 2008-mid, triple tragedy struck. First my girl, outright confessed to me, that she was with someone else and dumped me, and married someone else abroad and met me one last time before going out to another country saying me final goodbye. a few days later, my dad died under mysterious circumstances, with some saying he committed suicide and some thinking he had brain hemorrhage. A couple of days, after he passed away. the Banks came over to my company, took over all the assets and sold it to another company and gave me literally peanuts. And it was all hell which broke loose during that month. I had been reduced from living like a king to a roadside homeless beggar. almost overnight. Within 6 months, i started my new company from scratch paid off my father's pending loans, creditors and taxmen (which would continue to be paid off even 5 years later). I ultimately got married and have a son now. and after that i came to know that my mother had a secret affair with one of the worst humans i know even during the time when my father was alive. I confronted her and she didnt give me a straight answer. Few months later, she took all the money, property papers etc and fled to this monster of a man. I confronted her again and ultimately she wanted me & my wife/son out of the house. Eventually we had to move out and i was thrown out of her inheritance and strangely my sisters also accepted my mother's decision and stayed with her and sided with her. they took almost 90% of my money (which i foolishy gave them and trusted them)Ever Since then, my life has been close to hell. My wife thinks she had bad luck that she got married to me and face all these problems which other women don't and it had made her infuriated against me even for a small issue, to which i cant say a word anymore. i couldn't and cannot fully concentrate on my work, even though work is going OKish. I am surrounded 24/7 by nostalgia of how my life had been and how it just slipped right out of my hands despite my best fucking efforts. I used to be so driven and willing to take risks. But now im a shadow of my own self, withering in pain silently, not able to say anything back to anyone and just accepting how things are. I work silently and still give in my best thought and best efforts. Literally almost all family connection i had is now a faded memory, the person i loved a most and who loved me the most was my dad. Everyone else is estranged now. Anyone else in my position at any given point between these last 10 years, would outright commit suicide. But i have stood upright and taken in all wrong and right criticism thrown at me and i have literally taken everything on the chin. I think its wrong that i am alive and i feel EMPTY inside. No emotions, just a long dull pain. What i have gone through, i cannot even imagine anyone else being in that position and living through it. I literally was a millionaire and then became peniless , millionaire again and now again just passing through time. Even though i dont have money problems even now. Everything else just feels COLD. Emotionless, like a gulp in the wind. I literally had a heartbreak with my own life, which i loved so much and now whatever i try, i'm just clutching at straws. I even tried smoking weed once or twice a month and i must say, it gives me a clear vision for that month and makes me bit more calm.

Observations,"I'm typing this to either figure out a reason to live, or to confirm that my life might as well end. At this
 point, I don't care what happens.Here are the facts. I used to care about my future, and I had lofty goals of being a scientist and
making the world a better place. I thought I could advance human knowledge and get us closer to reaching
 the stars. Big dreams.Of course, I was deluded. Maybe if I had time, money, resources, and energy, things would have been
 different. Maybe I could have been the next Einstein.But time passed. Everything I did slowly depleted my energy, as I realized such goals were nearly
impossible. My ambitions faded. Failure after failure after failure. A lot of confusion and no accomplishments.
A lot of basic knowledge in practically every field of science, but nothing advanced enough for me to figure
out something new.Besides, there are thousands of actual scientists doing everything I wanted and more. Yet there have
been no revolutions. Just tiny increments made by far more intelligent and driven people than I.So, I got into game development. I can write. I can design game mechanics. I can
solve problems. How hard could it be?Again, the life was sapped out of me, due to a combination of overambition and a
lack of energy. Endless half-complete projects. Some good ideas, but too ambitious to
achieve without 10+ years of constant effort. I learned so much, but got nowhere. Again.Again, my ambition slowly faded. Nothing finished. Once again my apathy crept in,
and once again I stopped caring.Another problem with that whole game development thing: As vital as it is in
anything technical, I hate programming. Endless hours of configuring libraries, messing
 with compilers, dealing with hardware quirks, figuring out cryptic documentation (or not
 having any documentation at all), puzzling over bizarre code... the list of problems is
endless. It seems that 99% of programming is spent being useless and confused. Maybe
 that's just me. I don't care anymore either way.So once again, I was useless. Many times I thought about getting into a development team of some sort. But then I'd have to deal with someone else's abandoned projects, and have my work stolen.That brings me to another matter: Humans are trash. With a species as generally advanced as we are, you can expect some horrible individuals. But humans display so much stupidity, greed, and cruelty that it boggles the mind. ""But there are so many GOOD people out there!"" I hear some say. Of course there are. And for each good person, there are a hundred morons or sadistic monsters out there.Stupidity is the real issue in all of this, though. You'd think in the information age, we would see a massive golden age of education. That's true to a degree, but it's only proven that there are millions of idiots out there who don't want to learn or use their brains. Which means the problem is mass stupidity, not a lack of education.So far, I have a lot of failed dreams and a problem with stupidity. It's not the end of the world, though. But I'm not done. Not even close.Next is the problem of where to go from here, and why. I have no future, no energy, no ambition, and no goals. I've been in an endless loop of learning, trying, and fizzling out for something like six years now. I'm sick of it. And what's next? More overworking, in a pointless rat race job where skills don't matter and playing corporate politics gets you everywhere. A meaningless and stupid life.And to even do all that? I would have to use energy that I don't have. Repeat for 50+ years, and then I die anyway. What a pointless life.""But you have so much to live for!"" Do I really? Half of my life will be spent in debt slavery if I even have the will to get that far. America: Land of Greed, Home of the Debt Slaves. And if I ever need a doctor, I'm done for. Because of greedy idiots and everything in medicine being obscenely overpriced. I've thought about just leaving; going to a country that's not run by shortsighted greedy morons. But I have neither the money nor the energy to do such a thing.So where am I now? No life to live for. No motivation to try anymore. A bleak future of probable debt and homelessness. A lot of incomplete knowledge that I don't care to use anymore. Mediocrity and failure. And when all is said and done, I really don't care. I don't even regret what could have been. I've just accepted that I've lost the will to do anything, and life is going to be unpleasant from now on.And if it isn't? Then I got lucky. The world doesn't care about you or me, and it certainly doesn't care if someone's life goes better than predicted. It's just chance. I'd rather not gamble an entire life of misery for brief moments of passing enjoyment.I don't care about what blind optimism you might spew at me, because it's delusional tripe. I don't care if one good thing might happen in a lifetime of misery and failure. I don't care to even TRY, because odds are I'd fail anyway, even if I had the energy to do anything. I just don't care anymore.I've rambled long enough. This hasn't been nearly as thorough or structured as it could have been, but -- you guessed it -- I don't care. This was a personal exercise anyway, and I've only verified everything I've been thinking about for years. I don't see myself being alive another two years. Maybe not even six months.Against my better judgement, I'm posting this to Reddit. I don't really care where this post goes (mods can delete it for all I care), but I think I've put it in roughly the right subreddit. Every discussion I've seen of this sort has been worthless to me, and this one probably won't be any different. We'll see.Oh, and to dispel the useless generic responses: I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I exercise regularly, I don't care about friends, I don't care about family, I don't care about relationships, and I don't care to have kids.

Hopeless.,"I posted here a little while ago, but here is the outline of my story. The last 3 and a half years have been hell. My head hurts, my face feels congested and blocked, my ears crackle, pop, block and hurt with every swallow. Loud noises make my eardrums rattle like a blown out speaker. After seeing herbalists, ENTs, nutritionists, allergists, osteopaths, doctors and dieticians I was no closer to finding out why I had these symptoms. I was becoming a nervous wreck as I cut out dairy, sugar, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and basically every pleasurable food except for fruit. I was given every anti allergy and sinus drug, spray, tool and device you could think of. Nothing was helping it. I was stuck in bed, feeling more depressed with my constant head cold like symptoms, feeling lethargic, sad and desperate.                                                                                                          My anxiety was becoming horrendous, I was developing OCD because of the fear of touching/smelling/inhaling everything in case that was why I was having these symptoms. My doctor told me I could be like it for life and I may never get better. We finally found an ENT who took me seriously 18 months later. He scanned my sinuses and ears and said they are perfectly clear and diagnosed a jaw issue. Finally, I had a reasoning, a medical reason for feeling like I did. TMJ. I matched every symptom perfectly and there was hope. We found a dentist who specialised and he ordered a scan which showed significant damage to the TM joints and degeneration. A heavy programme of physio, rehabilitation, splint therapy and soft food followed as I finally got out of my lower, hopeless moods and anxieties and found a path to normality. The pain got worse and worse as I underwent treatment, and I went on painkillers daily. I was miserable, but hopeful. He retired last Christmas and I saw a colleague who referred me to the surgeon they use. He said the issue hadn't resolved at all non invasively and now it was time for surgery. I'm in the UK and the waiting lists over here for the NHS are exterminate, so we had to self fund. Lying in bed the night before, I knew I would either get my life back, or it would fail and I would feel worse than ever. The operation came, went and 4 months later I've not seen any improvement, and have now developed severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms after collapsing 2 days after the surgery. The nurses put it down to taking off the bandages and the heavy cocktail of drugs I was on, but it was terrifying. My head felt pressured, things felt surreal and it shook me. I now keep having panic attacks ever since. My anxiety daily is 100/100. I'm severely depressed, in pain, things feel surreal and I'm forgetful. I'm seeing a therapist who is trying to help me manage my pain and, although she is so lovely and helpful, it just is so tough talking about it. I'm empty, broken, hopeless and sad. I'm waiting for the next anxiety attack, living through the days terrified of my anxiety, avoiding everything because I'm now not 100% sure what is causing the symptoms, and waiting to go back to sleep. Things are a blur, and my therapist said I am severely anxious and depressed and struggling to find positivity as well as having flashbacks.

In hospital.,"I'm in a foreign hospital getting treatment for my recent suicide attempt.I really hate myself for this. I didn't go through with it because I upset my partner so much but all I feel I did was force her to stay when she didn't want to. I was all intent on doing it, on stopping bringing her down, and then she begged me not to and I convinced myself she cared and checked in, got stitched up and now I'm here a few days later. Except I think she just felt guilty and didn't want it on her conscience. I don't think she really wanted me alive. I think she just didn't want the guilt and I feel terrible. All I did was what I did as a teenager, threaten suicide and told as many people as possible I was gonna do it so they'd all feel guilty. I haven't improved at all. I'm a fucking child.  A brat. A horrible brat. I wanted to end my life as an aggressive and hurtful thing. Not because I wanted to end my life (although I did and still do). I'm all stitched up and heavily monitored. I'm 26, my hair is falling out, I'm a recovering addict... I've just got nothing to show for my life and when I'm given the chance to do something, I try and kill myself instead of doing it. It's pathetic. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm an anorexic, abused (as a child), broken, wannabe Junkie and I'm scum. I think I ruin so many lifves by existing.

One more night...,"First time posting on any sub...here goes... So Im bipolar (diagnosed and untreated), Ive self medicated with opiates since the death of my mom who raised me. My parents divorced at ten, and both remarried abusive assholes who dont care about me. My dad wasnt bad, he just wasnt available. 4 days a month at his place and we never spent time together on those days anyways...back to mom...she was my world, my support, she made the best of every bad situation, and was always there. After having a nervous breakdown at mid 30s, she struggled with bipolar disorder and alcoholism for 18 years, then git sober, good medication regiment, divorced stepdad got a great boyfriend. Diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage 3b may 2011. She died 1 month after my wedding 10-1-11 of cancer. Ive been with my wife 6 years married, 15 years total this year. We have 2 sons (4 and 1 y.o.) We have struggled with through my substance abuse, 3 miscarriages, money problems and more jobs than I can recall. I cant hold a job; used to be able to for a few years at a time but now I work about 5 to 7 a year.  Just lost the best job Ive ever had (construction), and was simply told it wasnt a good fit... We have title loans, payday advances, credit cards, past due on all bills, all because I cant manage a job. I just cant do it. Just cant. I am 36 years old, have been surpassed by all my peers career-wise, Im tired man, like just bone weary of letting people down, and coming up short as a provider. The amount of resentment my wife has for me is staggering and I understand her position perfectly. This job was my last chance. This was it..... Tonight was gonna be the night. I know she and my boys would be fine (her parents are incredibly well off, but from humble beginnings /salt o' the earth types who have always treated me well.) My youngest asleep, I lay with my oldest in my bed, wife on her side with him in the middle, a literal ocean of time and distance between us, and was telling him bedtime stories .. We talked about heaven and how nice it will be to be there one day. It was a nice moment, a memory to take and I was ready...Beneath us is the garage where I have ready my car, a length of hose, duct tape, a pvc step down adapter, (homemade) for the tailpipe, note written and last will made (short considering all items Ive owned worth anything are long gone). The reason you are reading this now is because of something he said...after the last story, I kissed his forehead, said ""you are the best parts of me, you are my favorite person, and you are a good son."" He said, ""I know daddy, Im a good boy, Im good at school, I listen to my teacher, you are my best friend, and you will teach me to grow up, right?."" Those last 9 words fucking gutted me... I literally sat on the steps in the hall shaking and sobbing so loud and hyperventilating I ran outside so as not to wake anyone. That uncertainty of how his life will turn out is my greatest source of turmoil. I think he will be better without me, but what if? What if my wife gets with an abusive asshole and this chain comes full circle?... I was ready man, tonight was it, I have given it all I got, there is nothing more, its broken and lost and Im ok with that but I have to go...and tonight, if only for tonight, my son pushed me back.

Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks. A few days later, during an anxiety attack, a friend messaged me and I impulsively told her that I've been suicidal for the past year and that I was having a mental breakdown. And now I'm telling you, internet stranger.I'm not sure what I expected to get out of telling people. I guess I was looking for some reason to live to just hit me, but it hasn't. Now I just feel more trapped than ever. If I kill myself now, I'm going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt. My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything. All that remains is an obligation to others. That's all I have left.

I've never been suicidal until now.,"& I don't really have a solid reason why.  The past few weeks have gotten progressively worse.  It started as simple stress & 3 months later, I just don't want to do it anymore.  No one in my family knows. The only person I tell is my boyfriend and it overwhelms him to the point where he doesn't even reply because he doesn't know what to do.  I called him crying mid panic attack because I didn't know what else to do & he got mad at me saying that I timed it perfectly since he's currently in Las Vegas at a music festival and I was only doing it because he's there.  I wish that were true. I would so much rather be that ""crazy"" girlfriend than to live with the thoughts in my head. He says he cares but will go hours with out checking his phone. He doesn't think its real.the past few weeks, I could feel this darkness inside of me grow and grow. I have cried every night wishing I could just make everything stop.
I've never been suicidal and these thoughts don't make sense to me. I keep trying to convince myself that it's for attention like everyone will think, but I don't think it is. I think about dying every night & how its an escape from tomorrow & every day after that.  I try and think about my family but there seems to be a mental wall where my brain isn't let me see over it.  I can't think about them. I won't allow myself to feel that.  It feels selfish & I feel guilty.
I've lived 22 years with anxiety and depression.  I have journals from 6th grade talking about suicide and how it felt like it was an inevitable thing. I used to self harm when I was 8 to get away from the emotional angst even though I didn't know what I was doing at the time.  This has always been apart of me.
I sought help January of this year and it helped in the beginning but now I feel like this is too much.  I just want to be hospitalized or something out of my own control so I can regain control but I don't have that kind of money and not a single part of me can tell my parents.  I want to tell them so badly so I can get it off my shoulders but I've seen how they react to that sort of thing first hand. They made my sisters feel guilty each time they chose to be hospitalized.

Is it normal to be envious of someone who just committed suicide?,"I don't think I'm your typical depressed person. Or maybe I am and just don't realize it. I've been very depressed since I was about 16, I'm now 25. I don't have the support system I wish I did and I don't have the money for a therapist. I drink, smoke weed, and take prescription pills to cope.(I don't buy these things my boyfriend does and I just take them because I'm the worst person on the planet) So I guess I'll start with the reasons I think I'm so depressed. When I was 16 I had what I thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents. Until the day my dad left my mom. It was totally unwarranted. I even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke. NOT A JOKE. Fast forward to now. I found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years. My mom knew nothing. My parents ""friends"" decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final. Being sixteen and going through that was hell for me. I remember trying to cut myself but I was too scared to cut too deep. All I ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist. Real edgy. Anyways, so I've also been in love with someone for eh 9 years. The problem being this person lives in a different country. He had no intention of moving to the states(can't say I blame him). And to be honest if I were to move there I don't think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently . He tells me loves me from time to time but that's easy to say when you know you'll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that. So just about every year-two years I skip from relationship to relationship. I think So I don't get attached. I dk but it's really hard on me mentally and it's even harder because I don't truly understand why I do it.Okay so fast forward to last December. I found out I was pregnant. It was a weird feeling. I was so overjoyed I think because I thought it would give me purpose. I had just started a new job and didn't want to tell them immediately so I hid it from them. It was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though. One morning I woke up at 3am with horrible cramps. I didn't fall back asleep. I was getting up and around for work at 6 and I was spotting so I called into work. I told them I thought it was an ovarian cyst. When I got to the hospital everyone was really nice(I think they already knew what was going on). Fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours. I found out that the fetus inside me was dead. Who knows how long I had been carrying that thing inside of me dead. They gave me my options and I told them I would think about them, make a few calls to my insurance provider, and let them know tomorrow. They sent me on my way. At 6pm that night I had a miscarriage in my bed. It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced . Now I'm pretty traumatized. I mentally can't have sex anymore and it's been putting a huge strain on my relationship.So, I bought a gun. My boyfriend thinks it's because I want to practice shooting. The real reason I bought it was because I figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself. The problem is i'm not afraid of death. I could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now. The other problem is that I am an empath and I know killing myself would hurt a lot of people. It's not their fault they don't understand how much pain I'm in. I've tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe I should get some help. Well it's really fucking difficult to get help when I'm barely paying my car payment, car insurance, phone bill, and rent. Plus gas for the hour to and from work ride I have m-f. So I guess I should explain how my title is involved. A few days ago I found out someone I graduated high school with committed suicide. My family has known his family forever but we weren't ever really friends. I found myself crying all day long over this person I was never friends with. I realized I was crying because I was envious. I wanted the courage he had to go through with it. I really don't want to be here anymore but I don't know how to turn my conscience off to go though with it.I don't know what to do anymore. All I think about is killing myself. I want it so bad. I don't know if I'll ever have the balls to do it or not. But thanks for reading anyways.

I feel pathetic and lost.,"Hi, I'm new to reddit and sorry if I'm doing something wrong here(please let me know).
   My life is so pathetic and I honestly wish sometimes I don't know why I exist. Since grade school, I was always the almost non-existent friend that somehow gets bullied when I hit the spotlight (for whatever reason). I've left school twice, to get home schooled and medical treatment/therapy. Ever since, I've always had a desire to be liked and ""known"" because of this. Whenever I see people I know having fun, being surrounded by many people, and exist in other's lives, I get extremely jealous. I honestly feel pathetic that I even get jealous because I don't even deserve to be jealous.
   Prior to transferring to my current uni, I was excited to start brand new and be part of the fun at such a prestigious university. Now I'm a senior and I'm still alone, with subpar GPA. I regret everything I've done this past year because I haven't done any impressive EC's, low GPA, and obviously no friends. I feel so pathetic that I couldn't achieve a high GPA when I had no social life to begin with. I'm aiming for grad school (PHD), but at this rate it's probably impossible because of my below 3.5 GPA. I constantly think about professors and grad students probably mocking me how I perform in class. I'm afraid of peers probably looking down on me. I'm constantly overwhelmed with fear when I'm at school.
   I was actually blessed to have a friend for a few months, but one day I was shut down by the friend because I was ""pathetic, weak-willed, egocentric, good for nothing"". This happened when I reached out to the friend when I was suffering with depression and anxiety. After that it has scarred me tremendously and I've became afraid to be friends or open up to anyone. Now I spend everyday alone. I've lost touch with all my friends from back home after moving.
   I can't stop thinking about how my grades are poor, the loneliness, and my self-worth. I honestly feel like I have no talent in anything and it makes me wonder what purpose I serve in this world. I really feel like a good for nothing, just like the friend said. I don't have (or ever had) anyone who would even care about me. I can't stop thinking about ending everything. Probably the only thing I would miss (holding me back) is my parents and boyfriend that I semi-trust. But I can't seem to have enough energy to continue and care about them. I probably am egocentric, because I pretty much can only care about how I feel and what I want. I can only seem to care about the happiness that will come out of suicide.

Trapped/Suicidal. How? You guessed it. Money.,"I have another account that I often browse with but it�۪s connected to my emails and usernames I use on other sites, so I made this. If this ends up too long I�۪ll add a TL;TR at the end. Recently finished a degree. Got a basic job so I can save for a flat before applying for a Masters degree in 2018. I�۪ve suffered from major anxiety issues for about 7 years, mainly because I was always quite outgoing and confident, then my teeth became overcrowded, sucking the life out of my confidence. But anyway, the current issue is that just as I was getting on my feet financially and being able to dream about finally starting my life properly and paying to get my teeth fixed, my mother has pulled me into an inescapable mire. She�۪s racked up ���, and counting, in rent arrears, not to mention she can�۪t afford to pay her incoming rent (due to issues that aren�۪t really relevant here). This has left me in a position where all my monthly wage goes towards keeping her from being homeless, which has taken away my first real chance to make a real life for myself. There is absolutely no way out of this situation. I�۪ve spoken to relevant departments and benefits experts, but ultimately all roads lead to my life being ruined for as long as she lives. She raised me, I know, and I don�۪t hold a grudge against her. But I�۪m older than I�۪d like to admit and it has taken me so long to get to where I am, with what seemed to be real opportunities ahead of me. Now my life exists to work an uninspiring job, with zero confidence and anxiety issues that are off the charts. If I lived in the US I�۪d buy a gun and end it. Too scared to do the pills/whisky thing, too scared to do anything else really. And as much as people will say things will get better, they can�۪t. I�۪m completely trapped in this situation, a situation I can�۪t handle for much longer.TL;TR: After a long, long time I finally got my life on the right path, had a plan to tackle my anxiety and a clear plan to move on with my life. Suddenly my mother tells me she owes ��� in rent arrears and will be made homeless if I don�۪t pay her rent and set up a payment plan for the arrears. It�۪s taken me longer than I�۪d care to admit, even online, to get to a stage in my life where I could finally move forward but the moment it appeared it�۪s been taken from me. Suicide appears to be my only option because as selfish as it sounds, I need to progress with my life and after all this time, energy and work, I can�۪t do that. It�۪s over for me.

I really need help but dont know what to do,"I was suicidal in high school, went through therapy, got pilled up and felt worse for it. All they made me feel was numb and alone at the same time. I felt like a third person, watching myself live life. When I went away to college, I started feeling better. I met a girl that showed me happiness was possible, and it was the first time in my life I felt genuinely loved by someone because of who I was as an individual, and not because of relation. That joy was fleeting though, shortly after being together the depression came back. but i wasn't suicidal anymore. flash forward years later and the suicidal tendencies and thoughts crept back into my head. Two months ago, she realized she couldn't deal with it anymore after 4/5 years together and broke up with me. Now I feel all alone.  The only person that could pull me out of my worst spots is gone. She was also the one that would push me to do something with myself when I felt helpless, and would try as hard as possible to make me happy, even if it was just for a moment. She was my best friend and my lover in one. I always told her she was the best thing that ever happened to me and would try as hard as I could to make her feel appreciated. But now weeks after our breakup, I still keep in contact with her, but she said she only ever feels sad when she sees me. That, coupled with the rumors I hear about what she's doing nowadays hurts, so I don't know if talking to her is a good idea anymore. I love her still, and I feel my best talking to her, but I can't bear the impact I have on her and how I feel afterward. She isn't the source of the depression, nor is she the source of these tendencies I have. I just felt like sharing that because now I don't know who I can lean on and what to do for myself. I want to get better, but I fear that it's too late for me. I really just want someone to talk to and lean on.

It can haunt you anytime and anywhere. And sometimes I don't think I can deal with it anymore, where I have to hide myself from everyone else and pretend that you're fine when you're actually not. Where depression and PTSD is not talked about and people think that you're just over-dramatic person. I've told my parents about this before, and now, they act like it didn't happen and sometimes make jokes about the issue im facing. ��Everytime I feel depressed, sometimes I would do something that I know is bad for me like mixing alcohol and other stuff, or taking a lot of meds than I should have, just sleep off the pain, or when I'm too scared, I just cry myself to sleep. So maybe, maybe if I do kill myself, would it still be as peaceful? And will I feel satisfaction as I did on my dream?

I wish I had jumped 133 days ago when I had the strength,"Yes, I've been keeping count. It was May 7th, 2017 that I decided that I was nothing more than a hazard to society, and that I was gonna end my life by jumping off the bridge near my house. But my friends called the police. 7 days later, I was out of the psych ward. The bridge is always still there, but on that day I couldn't fear death less. Now? Not so much. Typical cowardice. And before you get your sympathy up and going, I'm not the type of person you guys can relate to. I didn't have problems at school. I didn't have troubles at home. I have a good circle of friends, some of whom are ""actually depressed,"" and the only reason my lovely girlfriend left me was because of my ""issues"" (more on that in a second). Even my work wasn't that bad, before I got fired for missing shifts. Sure the docs diagnosed me with MDD, but I think that's bullshit. I don't even have real depression. The only reason I even have ""depressed episodes,"" and the reason I need to kill myself in the first place, is because I have anger issues. That's right guys, I'm so pathetic that I can't even control my emotions enough to make my life worth living. Literally all it is is that I'll get angry about something(s), I'll try to hold it in like a normal person, it'll explode out because I'm too weak and fuck shit up, and I'll beat me up for being the piece of shit monster that can't control my emotions who's only role in the world is lashing out at people in rage like some sort of tool of God's wrath that should just kill himself before he fucks even more shit up. That's my ""depression."" Even just thinking about my anger issues makes me feel ""depressed."" I know, what a joke. And like I said, they diagnosed me and even prescribed me some drugs, but I haven't even been picking them up. People with actual mental problems need those, not some jackass like me. Besides, even if they ""lift my mood,"" someone like me doesn't even deserve help. Justice is punishing those who do wrong. That's why I only ever post about my problems online, instead of talking about them in the real world where people will force me to get the help that I don't deserve. I probably should have posted this to  instead, but since it deals with suicide talk, they'd probably prefer it here. Just remember guys, no matter how worthless you feel, you'll never be as much of a joke as this guy. Hopefully that helps you a little bit, but maybe not.

I left everything behind, my parents, my ""freinds"" (I'll touch on that later) followed the only person that I loved, a girl who was a foreign exchange student at my school last year, I had worked so hard to find a school where I could study in english and still be in the same city as her. Yeah well you can guess how that worked out. She knew I was coming across the world, I had paid for my college, rented an apartment, and was 100% committed to her. And she still fucking left. Just like everyone else. And guess what. She replaced me with somebody who looks almost exactly like me. A FUCKING DOPPELGANGER. I've gotten messages from people asking if it was me. Yeah no it fucking isn't. Anyways, I'm in Germany now, and I don't speak a word of German. I've gone through my schools international department for everything, but I have nothing done yet. I don't have health insurance, I don't even have a full student visa, only my 90 day entrance visa and that's running out soon. But that's the least of my worries. I'm sure I sound whiny. Go ahead and criticize me if you want, you can't say anything worse about me than I've already thought about myself. Anyways, after all the fucked up shit she did, I still love her. But that's not the only reason I envision death. Not only have I lost her, I've lost all my close friends that I've known for years. People I grew up with. People who watched me grow up. Just gone. Why? I'll give you some examples of the last conversation I had with some. I asked ""Hey, I'm feeling down again today, I don't really know what to do, can you help?"" Their reply was ""Ask someone else, I really don't want to hear it anymore"". Even today, I asked another ""Hey man, can you talk?"" and got the response ""Can I? Yeah I can.

Seriously Considering,"Now, for some backround, I have thought of dying and how much better it would be many many times.  I'm 37 and have been having thoughts like this for nearly my entire life.  Outside of once or twice though, It's not something I ever felt like I was serious about.  Last night however, I scared even myself.  It has been a bad week.  Nothing too terrible and stuff that I know most people could, and I should, be able to just shrug off and keep going.  However, it feels like certain people, mainly my boss/Dad and sometimes my wife, are actually trying to piss me off.  It's pretty well known to them that once I get really pissed off, to the point of walking away, that I end up very very depressed, yet it seems like they do it on purpose anyway.  For example, yesterday, I was out on our mobile store, because the regular driver quit a while back.  It runs on a propane generator, or we can plug in, to run the lights and A/C unit back there.  I was at a site where running the cord left a trip hazard, so decided against pulling out the cords and just ran the generator.  Supposed to be there from 12-5.  Around 2PM, on what is one of the hottest days of the year in South Texas and the generator runs out of propane.  My fault in a way because I forgot to check it.  I don't drive this thing though.  It requires a CDL which I don't have.  One of our other drivers drives it to the site for me, i drive his van and he goes about his day doing a different task while I man the mobile store.  So it's not an option for me to simply go fill the propane and carry on.  So, I bring out the cords and plug in.  It's 2 cords, this is important.  One cord that has a standard plug on one side and the other end is the big round 3-prong plug normally found on washing machine, because that's what the truck uses to plug in to the generator or the cord.  Now this single cord by itself was not long enough, so I get the second cord, which I call an extension cord, which has a male and female end with the round plugs.  So in short, I plug the cord with the regular wall socket in to the wall, run the cord out, plug the extension cord in to that cord and plug that in to the truck.  Pretty simple right?  Well, it didn't work, and here's where all that becomes important.  I call my boss/Dad and explain the situation to him.  His answer is, ""What do you mean extension cord, I've used that cord at the office before and it works.""  I reply with, ""Yes, I've used the standard cord before and know it works, but I have not used the extension cord before, as far as I know it is untested and the previous driver never plugged in anyway.  I'm guessing it's faulty.""  So he responds, ""I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean extension cord?  What is that?  I've never seen one before.""  So I proceed to describe the two cords the same way I did above.  He still has NO FUCKING CLUE what I am talking about.  This is one of the things that easily upsets me.  I know it probably shouldn't, but it does.  When I explain something really fucking simple and someone just does not understand.  So he starts bitching at me that he doesn't have time to deal with this.  I say fine, I'll just hang out, only a couple hours left at this point, I can sit in the A/C of their break room and come out when people approach the truck and then go back to the A/C.  It won't be too bad.  He says no, that's unacceptable for the customer experience.  I agree to an extent, but these guys need what we are there to provide.  So he decides, instead of just taking my word it's not working, that he's gonna come out and take a look, bitching the whole time that he does not have time for this.  I agree, I tell him i do not think it's going to do any good to come out, but I am getting really upset at this point because he doesn't know what a damn extension cord is.  So he gets there, realizes what it is and that it's faulty and bitches some more about having to come all the way out there.  Decides to call the other driver back, close up shop and reschedule.  That's fine, I need to get out of there anyway, I'm having a really tough time not losing it at this point.  So I wait around another little bit for the other driver to show up, swap vehicles, go out through security who has to inspect the back of both vehicles and it takes some time.  Drive all the way back across town and it's nearly 4 at this point.  Now, keep in mind, that because I had to leave for this appointment at 11 and we were there from 12-5, I had not had lunch.  I've been out in the heat for the past 2 hours and am dead tired.  So I am telling him this and that at this point, I really just want to head home and eat.  Instead, he assigns me a task that he knows is gonna take me 2-3 hours.  WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK?!?!?  I have not eaten all day, I am covered in sweat, I have black crap all over me and my clothes from moving those dirty cords around, I had come in early that day because I had other stuff that needed to get dome before I left for the appointment and now he's wanting me to stay late?!?! With no lunch?!?!  I'm pissed, walk out, went home and sat in the shower for an hour.  Finally went downstairs and ate dinner then wife heads off to bed after getting our daughter in bed.  This is where I was sitting there, and really seriously considering just killing myself.  I was even <removed because I guess it's explicit and against the rules>.  I did not actually <removed> of course, as I am here today, but I was very close and today I am very scared of what I might do.  In the end, I was thinking about how it would be for my wife to wake up to that.  She would likely lose her job as she would not be able to go due to having to deal with a dead me and getting our daughter to school, or whatever else she would have to deal with.  So I didn't.  But it's the closest I have come and I am scared of myself.  If I had been just a little angrier or more depressed, would I have carried through?  I don't know.  All I know is that I had an incident Friday that really set me off, then another Tuesday and then this.  I'm at my wits end.  These little things should not bother me so much, but they do.  I should be able to just ignore it and carry on, but I can't.  The scenarios play over and over in my head no matter how much I try to distract myself.

way.I have set a date. Its the day after my bestfriend is getting married. I want to see him on the happiest day of his life. I want to see him and be there for him. I don't want
to leave before then but if my life hasn't gotten better or somehow it gets worse by that time then the next day is where it has to end. I once said that I would wait untill
I was 30, but I can't fathom living through this much pain for that long. Everyday is a struggle. I wake up and want to do nothing and I honestly have done this to myself. I
think about things I can't control. I do things that are bad for me. I drink constantly and worry about stuggles that again I can't control. I get attached to people and when
they leave or I can't see them, I shut down. They consume my thoughts. There are days where I wake up and feel like I can take on the world. I get excited about living and
doing things I enjoy, about seeing people I love to be around. And then BAM without any warning I want to fucking kill myself. No feeling I have ever felt is worse than when
I feel good, and feel like everything will be okay and then it is ripped away from, sending me back to the endless abyss that I know so well. I just want this to be over.",A2,0.8,Content filtered,False,,,A2

"Failed attempt 1 month ago, going again.","I've lost all motivation to do anything, school work, any activities, even video games which I was completely addicted to only a year ago. Now I mainly just lay in my bed wondering why I even exist, for hours on end.

Just a month ago I had an extremely scary attempt. I hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if I stood on my tip toes I could barely breath, then I let my legs relax and swung them in front of me, I was completely blacked out within a few seconds. But then about 3 minutes later I just woke up for no apparent reason, the rope didn't break and there was still full suspension on my neck, but I still fucking woke up and survived. I didn't leave a note or anything, I just really, really wanted to fucking die that night.That was scary enough to make me stop for a month, waking up with a rope around your neck, cold, with saliva running down your face, slowly realizing where you are and what happened. But now the suicidal thoughts return and I want to try again. Perhaps I should tell someone about my problems, but they'd just call someone and take me to a hospital.

Looking for reasons to live.,"I'm 18 years old, living in the UK and to put it bluntly I no longer have any reasons to live.
I'm not a well-liked person in general, probably my own fault, I don't particularly make effort to befriend people and never like talking to anyone outside of my immediate small group of friends.

Added to this the fact that since we broke up, I have not been able to even successfully secure a single date and I have had to frequently hear from mutual friends how happy she is and all about what new guy she is dating.But the thing that really breaks my heart, is the fact that my own family don't love me.My mom is someone I have never gotten along with and she makes it apparent that she wants me to leave home as soon as possible, to the point where she has threatened to throw me out if necessary. (Currently I cannot afford to leave, despite working full time).

"Not a goodbye, just an acknowledgement","Hello.
I am relatively new to reddit, and it's a bit sad to say it's because of this subreddit I have finally decided to become an active user. Not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal, more in the sense that I've come to this website more and more to escape from my life. And today was the culmination of all of it, because I've found a place where I don't have to lie or pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm a compulsive liar; I suspect that is so because I want to retain a sense of control over my life, but that is a topic for another time.
I still don't feel comfortable enough to post my own story here. Not that I don't trust the people here, it's just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public, which i know is paradoxical, because it's a public anonimity, and everyone's intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves, but still, I have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror (that sounded really cringy, sorry about that).
What I really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations. The energy you guys dispense is your own, you are sharing these beautiful, sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding, that you can hear these scattered individuals' silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other people's. Your fight is your own, but the pain you feel is close to somebody else's. That loneliness, that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through, that feeling of an especially made pain for you, don't hold on to it, don't nurture it. Remember that many have beaten it, so can you, so can I, so can everyone in this subreddit.
I am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support. I know for a fact you've saved lives, but unfortunately people don't recognize you much for it, and i know that is not the point, nevertheless I admire your courage and perseverance. You are amazing, thank you!
For the ones in more precarious situations, the ones that write or read for support of their own, i have a bit of advice. Some days ago i was feeling especially down, so I decided to walk alone. I talk to myself a lot, so I kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself. I just know that at some point I started to run, with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general. It helped. There was a lot I had inside of me, and fortunately it helped. I have been worse than this, bound to my bed, empty and cold. I can feel that coming back. In those times, I tried suicide. Never managed to go through. But Im being completely honest, what kept me going was a violent hatred for life, fear and self-doubt. I dont have any self-confidence, so i just kept questioning my decisions. Strangely enough, that helped me get through that rough patch.
The conclusion Im trying to reach is, dont feel inadequate for your sadness, dont feel like a coward for being afraid, and dont feel like its your fault life is shit. I know its easier said than done, but truly, remember you, your body, your mind, whatever you want, its fighting for you to stay alive. Your knowledge of your situation may help you help others, your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody else's.  If so many have battled through, you can too, you've taken a beating, now use that blood to, uh, idk,  fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick.
And if you need, just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like.

I've been depressed my entire life. I find it hard to cope with little things. I live in a state of constant anxiety that has seen me fail at my dream of beginning a teacher (I can't pass this times test, I am fully competent to teach but cannot answer complex maths questions in 30 seconds so lol)I have a girlfriend who I do love to bits, but she's pretty selfish, e.g. I'll try and talk about the stress of looking after my daughter who has aspergers and mental health issues and she starts going on about how well her daughter is doing in school..she literally never asks how I am. I get really anxious about things, my neighbours have moved out and said a young couple are moving in. Knowing this is the sort of thing that makes me extremely anxious (I'm imagining terrible neighbours with banging music etc), my girlfriend commented ""they are bound to be the worst"" I just think why be such a jerk and make me feel bad about stuff. I feel very alone.I hate how I look. I have horrible teeth and I'm overweight, I smoke like a chimney and obsess about dying so want to stop smoking but feel so stressed I smoke more.Everything just seems bleak. I'm sure if it wasn't for not wanting to hurt my family, id have killed myself to end the constant pain I live with.",A2,0.85,"The text indicates persistent depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation, and difficulty coping with stressors, which suggest the need for intervention to address mental health concerns.

I'm about to run out of reasons to keep going.,"This week I just made a list of things that used to make me fell good and now prevent myself from ending my life, and I figured out that now I only have 1 motive to wake up in the morning and it isn't enough. I feel desperately lonely since 2012, when I moved into a new city and couldn't manage to make new friends, only the few ones that work with me (and, even though, they disappear as soon as I move to a new job). The only connection with my old life, friends and family was my ex-boyfriend, but our relationship was a mess. I don't even know if I really love him, like, ever. But we went along for 5 years. After my last birthday, in march, I just realized that he no long filled the emptiness in my heart and he doesn't even treated me like anybody was supposed to be treated by a loved one. Then we broke up.Now I have no family and no friends, my mom is the only one and we, like, hate each other. Playing videogames, watching movies or trying to pull myself into social situations doesn't seems to have any effect to relief the pain anymore.I tried talking to my ex again, but he doesn't want to talk to me anymore after the breakup. He was the only one able to keep the suicidal thoughts outta of my mind, and he used to have some kind of mental illness too, so we used to help each other. Now he's fine with his job, his new friends, his family that loves and supports him and I am no longer any relief to him, I ain't even a good memory, as he wants to erase me from his life at all costs. But he got his almost perfect life and I got nothing but nostalgic sadness.I feel empty and alone.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates active suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and a lack of social support, which are critical risk factors requiring immediate attention.",False,,,A3
Should I hang myself or jump?,"My tinnitus has driven me over the edge and now I'm starting to get serious about dying. I want to die in a more painless manor, but am too cowardly to shoot myself.

Another day,"That ""you are not depressed, you are just making this up to gain some attention, because this is the internet"" by some. And the ""usually by then you should be used to work training because you need to be used to the fact that sooner or later you'd leave the comfort zone"" and getting lectured on what sacrifice isthry never knew what sacrifices i did. Time check its 4:03am and honestly I don't enjoy eating cake at this time
Usually i eat a full meal.
And never think of what happened in the past
