My life is meaningless,I just want to end my life so badly. My life is completely empty and I don't want to have to create meaning in it. Creating meaning is pain. How long will I hold back the urge to run my car head first into the next person coming the opposite way. When will I stop feeling jealous of tragic characters like Gomer Pile for the swift end they were able to bring to their lives?
"Muttering ""I wanna die"" to myself daily for a few months now.","My relationship is complicated and painful, but I don't want to end it. While my girlfriend and I were broken up, I slept with her boyfriend. For three years I've been trying to make it up to her, but after a while I realized I don't think I ever will.I'm not sure she'll ever want to touch me again. She hasn't wanted to touch me since that happened, no matter how hard I try, no matter what I do or say. She does it for me, but she looks bored the whole time and gets it over with asap.I feel worthless. She's my soulmate. I can't live in this horrible world without her, but I don't think she wants to be sexual with me. I'm so lonely.I wish I could just turn off the part of my brain that feels. "
Work slave. I really feel like my only purpose in life is to make a higher man money. Parents forcing me through college and I have too much on my plate.,"I owe a lot of money , so I have to work.The catch is that barely any of that money goes to.I need a long rest from everything but my mom insists I finish and get my degree . I really think I should just focus on school and not work, or pay down my debts before finishing school. I don't have the option to do either apparentlyI know this is the easy way out , but I'm really tired. All of these issues are on top of dealing with tensions in America as well. I want to rest."
I did something,On the 2 of October I overdosed I just felt so alone and horrible. I was in hospital for two days now when I walk down the hallways of my school they always look at me weird and say I should take more pills. And I hate it i have no one. I have this voice in my head now and it won't go away and I can't be myself anymore. Thanks for reading
"Concerned but don't know what to say? Here are some simple, proven strategies for talking to people at risk.","There is no one ""correct"" way to talk to someone struggling with suicidal thoughts. Real caring is what ultimately matters, and it can take many forms. But if you're not sure what to say, these ideas may help.Avoid advice and solutionsSuicidal people typically don't feel change is possible. Anything that can be prefaced with ���you should�۝ can make them feel even more powerless. They often feel unworthy of help. ���Fixing�۝ or ���advising�۝ will reinforce that and make things worse.
This gets tricky because suicidal people often don�۪t see all the options they actually have. If and only if they've indicated to you that you've achieved a solid rapport (see below), it could be of real benefit to point these out, but there is a vital difference between ���you should do <action>�۝ and ���you could do <action>�۝. ���Have you thought of doing <action>?�۝ or ���What do you think about doing <action>?�۝ are other good phrasings. It�۪s fine to mention something that worked for you, but frame it as an example of something that they may or may not want to try.
If they ask for advice, you could reframe the conversation as working through the ���pros�۝ and ���cons�۝ of various options together.
If you're worried that someone is at immediate risk, take action yourself, don't tell them to do it.
Listen, empathise, and don�۪t judgeIf they say harsh things about themselves or others, this can be the truth of their experience even if it doesn't match objective reality. Consider the emotions embodied by the self-loathing or the tales of woe. You can connect with the person on a feeling level and simply set aside any questions of ""fact"".
Examples:
If they say: ���I�۪m a useless waste of skin. The world would be a better place without me,�۝ simply disagreeing can make them feel even more ���intrinsically wrong�۝. Instead, you might say ���It worries me to think of you feeling so bad about yourself. I wish I could help you feel better.�۝ This respects their emotional experience and shares your sympathy and concern, without getting into whether their self-assessment is accurate or not.
If they say: ���Everyone is mean to me�۝, you could respond with ���It must be so hard when every interaction hurts.�۝ This tells them that you hear their pain, but you have not judged (i.e. you have neither supported nor challenged) their assertion about how they�۪re actually being treated.
Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are. It�۪s not about their circumstances; it�۪s about their suffering, and you can�۪t measure that from the outside. A message that in any way tries to tell or show the suicidal person that ���it�۪s not so bad�۝ is just another way of saying ���I don't understand what you�۪re going through�۝.
Describing suicidal behaviour as ���selfish�۝ is even worse. The suicidal mindset usually includes a firm conviction that ���I can improve the world by taking myself out of it.�۝ Telling them how much their deaths will hurt others reinforces their sense of personal failure.
Never use any kind of ���tough love�۝. If you think they�۪d be fine if they just stopped feeling sorry for themselves, putting up with abuse, or staying stuck in the past, then you are not the right person to help, even if you�۪re correct. Chances are they�۪ve tried to do exactly that, over and over again, and failed. Everything you say to suicidal people needs to be grounded in the belief that they are doing the best they can to help themselves. If you don�۪t believe that, find them someone else to talk to.
Meet them where they areThe greatest gift you can give a suicidal person is the experience of being truly heard and understood. At most suicide hotlines, rapport-building takes up the bulk of the communications training.
It seems natural to try and pull a suicidal person out of whatever dark place they�۪re in. That almost always fails. What works, consistently, is simply to join them in the dark place and offer a non-judgemental, supportive presence. This is so simple that it can seem like doing nothing, yet it can also be so difficult that we can�۪t imagine how we can ever get it right.
Sometimes suicidal people can be reluctant to talk. Say that you just want to understand, and that you won�۪t try to suggest anything unless and until they are satisfied with your understanding of their experience.
Your questioning style can make a big difference: asking open-ended (���How do you feel?�۝) versus closed-ended (���Are you sad or mad?�۝) questions will ensure that they feel able to express whatever need to. If you ask if they�۪re ���sad or mad�۝ and they�۪re actually something else (anxious, numb, etc.), you may not get the information you need, and they may feel invalidated.
Help them by naming the emotions that you hear in their story, but which they may not be expressing, nor fully aware of.
Active listening, which demonstrates and refines your understanding, is a powerful rapport building technique. People in a suicidal state of mind usually feel profoundly alone. Saying ���I understand�۝ without proving it will often reinforce this sense of alienation. Some ways you can ���actively listen�۝ effectively are:
Ask lots of open-ended clarification questions. This shows that you care about getting it right.
Summarise, paraphrase and interpret what you�۪re hearing. This shows what that you�۪re taking in what they�۪re saying, and thinking deeply about it. It also offers them the chance to correct anything that you got wrong.
React genuinely and supportively. If you feel a strong empathetic response to what someone is telling you, share it. This shows that what they are going through matters to you, and that they�۪re getting through to you.
Remember that you�۪re just building your understanding: suspend your judgement and listen. You may hear some ugly truths, or even ugly untruths. The point is to understand, to go to the dark place with them, and those dark places are often dirty, smelly and full of evil things. Be ready for that.
Sharing your personal experiences can be a great help in building rapport, but it should be done only with the idea of establishing your ���street cred�۝ as someone who�۪s been in a dark place too. The danger is that they can feel like you�۪re assuming too much, not listening enough, or devaluing their pain.
You may need to ask tough or personal questions. Your goal is to ���map�۝ the dark place as well as you can. You can frame sensitive questions with: ���Do you mind if I ask you about <subject>?�۝
If, and only if, they indicate to you that they feel ���heard�۝, you might try some gentle re-framing of their view of the situation. While continuing to stress that you agree with them about how bad it is for them, you can try offering a hopeful perspective, if it's totally genuine. If they reject it, go back to active listening.
Don�۪t forget to look after yourself!Deep rapport with someone who�۪s suicidal can leave you feeling sad, frustrated, hopeless, or disoriented, even if you�۪ve really helped. This is why suicide hotline responders are typically required to debrief regularly. Be sure to talk to someone you trust if you find the conversation is weighing on your mind.
Keep your expectations realistic. Even with the best training and resources, sometimes conversations with suicidal people will take a wrong turn. Reaching these people is a tricky business, and not even the experts can get it right every time. Remember too that the immediate response isn�۪t the outcome. It�۪s not uncommon for callers to a suicide hotline to tell the responder that they weren�۪t very helpful, then call back days or months later to say ���Thanks, you saved my life�۝.
What�۪s the rationale for all this?It comes out of what has been proven to work at suicide hotlines, and what has been discovered in the latest research into suicide, especially the groundbreaking work by Thomas Joiner's group at Florida State University. Joiner�۪s model uses three necessary and sufficient factors for suicide risk, and these can help us identify strategies that will and won�۪t help:
Desensitization to pain and death. We can�۪t fix this in the short term; it�۪s acquired by life experience and extinguishes slowly, if ever.
Perception that one is a burden. We can prevent this from getting worse by avoiding solutions, advice, and judgements. We can sometimes improve it by reflecting back to the person things that we genuinely value or appreciate about them, but it has to be utterly sincere. If you can't find something specific, positive, and accurate to say, just move on to the next strategy. By building a strong rapport you may discover some genuine positives that you can reflect back to the person.
A deep sense of alienation. We can always do something about this one by making a deep interpersonal connection, and since all three factors are necessary for high risk of suicide, it's only urgently necessary to fix one. This is why it�۪s ���all about the rapport�۝!

Health anxiety prompting some bad thoughts in my head...,"I have been struggling for 2 months now with some health issues as a 26 year old male. My pessimistic nature just makes me think about the worst. My hands and feet are currently tingling and burning... Though I had multiple sclerosis or something as serious or even worse. Checked with doctors, did two MRIs (head, neck), they came clear.Still, hands and feet keep tingling, sometimes the pinky goes numb. My mind goes on a whirlwind thinking that those MRI missed something, that I'm part of those 5% whose MS diagnosis is not as straightforward and doesn't come up on the first MRI.This is fucking me up, eating me up. I just keep picturing myself on a wheelchair, being a burden to my family, girlfriend and so on.Suicide thoughts come to my mind as I prefer to put a sudden end to everything instead of deteriorating myself day after day, losing motor and cognitive functions.Life is already hard as it is and now my health is failing for the first time. "
"Everything is okay, but nothing feels okay","So, while I could definitely be doing better with life my future is looking pretty bright at the moment. I�۪m going to try to get an education next year for a job that I enjoy, I have a dog that I love more than anything (soon maybe a second dog too) and a caring family.I�۪ve always been a bit unhappy. As a kid too I think, although I can�۪t remember much of my childhood. I don�۪t  to kill myself, but sometimes that thought just comes creeping and it scares me a little.A few weeks ago a problem came up. It was a financial problem. Quite fixable, but I just couldn�۪t handle it. I tied myself a noose and everything. I was gonna do it. I was all alone in the house with my dog and both of my parents were off on vacation in another country, so there was really no one that would be able to stop me.I didn�۪t do anything, but I felt like I could have done it. Completely on impulse, over a fixable problem, leaving behind everything I love and my hopeful future.I feel it now too, creeping up on me. Everything should be fine, but I can�۪t help the feeling that I should just do it. Like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me. The only exception to this being my dog, which I think is mainly what keeps me here, along with my little sister."
PTSD and Alcohol,"I had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago (I was about 21, I'm about 26 now). I don't know how much of it was psychological trauma and how much was the concussion I sustained from being very badly beaten, but my memory of everything around that time is spotty. I forgot about/repressed it or whatever for several years. Something unrelated one day made me remember everything, it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like I was reliving it all and felt like I was having a never-ending panic attack for about 4 days. This buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol/pornography/cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant ways.I'm afraid to talk about what happened to anyone, even people I trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again or worse. I have ZERO desire to get any kind of justice or anything, I just want to move on with my life, but I feel like I just can't. I've tried self-help techniques and meditation but I still think about it every day and sometimes I'm just completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and can't escape them.I have been an unemployed shut-in living with my parents for several years. I'm afraid to go outside and can only force myself to do so if it's to buy drugs/alcohol. I'm so tired of living this way I don't know what to do. I tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and when I told him that I felt like he didn't really seem to be caring or paying attention to what I was saying he literally told me to my face he was just there to get his hours. I was devastated and gave up on the idea of therapy.I don't know what to do. I don't want to give up but it seems like it would be so easy. I am not dumb or crazy and am willing to at least listen to any advice people have to offer. Thank you for reading this."
I don't have long left...,"This past month has been the worst. 3 1/2 weeks ago I went on date with a guy and went to his place afterwards and he tried to force me to go farther than I wanted to go. I've been afraid to even hang out with a guy since.  The next day I was fired from my job. I spent the whole rest of that week alone filling out job app, which didn't help with my depression. The next week I started having some issues, went to get tested and found I had gotten gonorrhea from the guy that tried to force me. I went to dinner at a friends house and my car ended up getting towed, so I owe my mom $150 for that. I almost attempted suicide that day. Last week I almost tried again when someone blackmailed me and threatened to have me thrown in jail for something I didn't do. He knew where I worked and my parents names. And I started work last week but will only be getting a partial paycheck because of when I started and I'm currently -$75 for my bank account and behind on my bills so idk how much this check is gonna help. I just don't have any fight left in me anymore...."

You hated and ignored/yelled at me since I was a little boy and now I hate you forever. This hatred is killing me, but you refuse to talk about it. I can sense your mistrust when I am alone with mom, and it is disgusting that you do not trust us. Why else would you insist on us getting separate hotel rooms when I was about to get surgery? The rooms always had 2 beds. I know you love mom more than me, but it's disgusting when you don't even trust your own son to be with mom in the same bedroom, for whatever reason."
"I can't live in this world, ok? It's too much. It's too bad and too evil and I can't handle it anymore.","There's so,  much more evil in the world than good. Almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world, or people actively contribute to it. People harass, hate and kill each other for no reason. People get killed by natural disasters and most people don't give a shit at all. They just think ""whatever, better them than me"" and move on with their lives. Homeless people die in the streets and people think they're asleep and step over them after they were already ignored their whole lives. People out there do good but they could never keep up with the evil and suffering that goes on. Destroying things is way easier than fixing them, so the people killing and destroying will always be ahead. And as the world population grows this will only get worse and worse.People are evil or apathetic and they don't care that people around them are dying and suffering as long as it isn't them. People only care about their own money, feelings, goals etc. The minority of people who dedicate their time to helping people can never do enough no matter how great they are. I went to the 9/11 memorial about a year ago and it just shocked me how little people were affected. They just nonchalantly walked through like it was an art gallery. No emotion. We're numb to pain, we're numb to suffering, death, whatever. It's completely normal and I can't live in that anymore.Edit: this post makes me seem like a pretentious fuck anyway "
Why is mankind afraid of death ?,"Lately im asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays? back in the middle ages for example of course, you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that, but today ? Even if it is completly painless, why would you struggle to just end it all ? I myself am not suicidal i would say, even if i think about it more than often to just quit, go the ""pussy"" but easy way, why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route ?
personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown.
We dont know whats after death, because none really came back from actual death and reported about it (like actual clinical dead).
But is is really the only reason ?
Like i know im not going to kill myself (yet and it probably stays that way) because im just too much of a pussy to be a ""pussy"" if you get what i mean.
For me its just mindboggling and maybe others of you have some ideas or thoughts about this."
After failing once this is how I feel,"I wish that suicide was funded by the government. I wish guns for suicide would be like condoms, given to teens so if they're going to do it, they do it right. I wish euthansia was legal. I wish that I wouldn't have to fear buying poison or a gun off the black market because if I get caught my life would get worse. "
"My girlfriend left me, i hate college, i have no direction in life, i just want to go to sleep and never wake up (19m)","Title pretty much says it all. ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods. the only reason i havent done it so far is becasue im too much of a pussy. On paper i have a great life. I'm at a good college on a great scholarship in my second year, and im starting to blow it. Ive been depressed for a while but im slipping especially now that my (ex) girlfriend has been slowly drifting away from me. She finally dropped the bomb on me this morning and I shouldnt even be surprised. It was long distance and lasting really well but she just cant take my depression and constant negativity and sadness anymore. I know theres more fish in the sea and blah blah but im sick of waiting. im sick of waiting to feel better. everyone was so happy for me to go to college and its been hell ever since i came here. im surrounded by friends here and i have tons of friends back home. I have a supportive family. but i dont give a fuck anymore. I commute on the train a lot and some days i want to step just 4 feet infront of me so I can instantly die. I dont look carefully when i cross the road anymore. I have access to enough drugs to overdose on. I live near plenty of tall buildings. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, all the pills theyve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms. I dont care about leaving everything behind because life has been pain for me about the last 6 years. I've seen like 10 different therapists and my apathetic negative attitude has never changed.  Im smart but being smart doesnt mean shit. i have no work ethic or motivation for anything in life. I just picture everyone at my funeral being sad and thats one reason to stay alive.. i dont want to hurt the people  around me. but why should I  go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced? Fuck college. I'm undecided major and im mentally checked out of al of my classes. i can just imagine some stupid fucking candle light vigil they would do for me to raise suicide prevention awareness or whatever. fuck this world. my brain has never stopped being paranoid, anxious, upset, and unhappy. everytime im happy i realize im just faking it and putting on a facade for everyone else. ive reached out to friends and family about how i feel and they truly do care but im too far gone to help. one of these days ill be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger. figuratively / literally .  i guess im just posting this because im too afraid to tell people the absolute truth except for a bunch of strangers on the internet"
I'm going to kill myself this weekend,"UPDATE: Thanks for trying to help, reddit, but I don't see any reason to stay alive. Nothing has changed enough to make me want to stay.

I care about people, but no one gives a damn about me. I'm just a mattress.Future grad students, know that professors can and will steal your shit.

Now my heart wants to die too,"I've been struggling with depression, trauma, and suicidal thoughts for years. But honestly, things haven't been as painful as they are now. There is a girl who i fell in deep love with in June. Her name is Julia. and when i told her about it, she told me she didn't have feelings, but she would always tell me that we might date one day in the future so i decided to keep the feelings. After all, me and her had been best friends for about a year now, and she told me that me having feelings for her didn't make things awkward and that no matter what she'd always be my best friend and that the worst case scenario could be was her loving me as a brother. So I decided to just keep the feelings and see where life takes me with them. Then, around the beginning of september, I find out that she had been lying to me about many things over the summer. For example, she was dating this guy named Tom, and she lied to me about them dating many times (i had heard that they were, so when i asked her about it she would always deny it). Me and tom were friends, and i asked him if it was true and what was going on, and he too would deny it, he would even say that he never really liked her and they hadn't talked in months. But Tom lied about that, and so did Julia. That destroyed me. Not the fact that they dated, but the fact that she lied to me and kept things from me. The thing that really bothers me is that apparently they had sex. That really destroyed me hearing that. Apparently Julia told her close friends, her close friends told me, and I asked tom if it was true and he said yes. But the thing is is that some of my friends tell me that they're both lying about it, that they didnt have sex. I asked why they think so, and they told me that Julia lies about virtually everything, and she has lied about getting with boys before, and that there was no way she would lose her virginity to tom. That made me think, and the fact that tom was a liar too helped me believe that it was a lie. But the thing is is that I don't know for sure. And that bothers me. So much to the point where i'm just so depressed. I hate the thought of them having sex, while i'm here, sitting alone and alienated, confused, depressed, miserable, helpless and alone. And honestly at this point I just hate sex."

29 and missed my chance at love. death cant come for me fast enough.,"144 IQ. That's 99.83th percentile. I also have a MS and BA from top ten schools. Can't figure this out, somehow.I'm too old to attract someone I am attracted to. I see dozens of attractive women every day on my way to my no-growth temp job and even more on OKCupid. I'm just never good enough. Response rate to individually tailored messages is about 1-2%, and that's just to get a foot in the door. Given a response, ~80% will string me along on chat until what I can only presume is the hotter one of the ten other men talking to them that day asking them to come over and a subsequent drop off the face of the earth. If a date is somehow drawn from the stone, it is a free meal for her and amazing stress for me to not fuck up. I just get exasperated and end the night if they don't first. I'm so tired of performative bullshit to get even the minute chance of success. Why doesn't anyone ever try to impress me. Every time I have to put myself out there and just never feel like I have any intrinsic value.It feels like I need extrinsic value like prestige or money to be attractive. Get a job, my female relatives say. Doesn't that prove it is the money or status that is loved, rather than me? I have a temp job in chicago now and I'm behind where a ivy graduate should be [42k at 29 years old in a temp position]. its just not enough to make me worth something. im so tired of not being loved for who I am and envy the attention women get. I dont think I'll ever be wanted like that. just not good enough."
"I am newly married and my husband is wonderful, I love him so much, we are very much in love. So why am I suicidal?","I honestly can't figure it out. 9 days out of 10 I'm absolutely fine. Happy, positive, excited about life. Then it hits me. Depression. Crippling anxiety. Suicidal thoughts. I cut, I cry, I crumble. On days like this I can't believe that anyone cares at all about me, except my husband. Then I feel like I don't deserve him and sometimes push him away. What's wrong with me? What should I do? I just can't shake the thought that everyone would be better off without me, especially my husband."
I'm empty...,"One could say that I have it all. I'm in college in my senior year (Computer security). I'm mostly getting As and Bs. Never had a problem with any single class. I'm also working part-time as a programmer for a major company, which allows me to afford a small flat in a nearby city and pretty much anything a college student can want. To most people, I'm living the dream.But I'm alone. No one asks me how my day went. I'm just sort of here, doing the work and acing the tests, and that's all. Then I look around, and see everyone in a happy conversation...I've tried. I've made a few acquaintances. But I don't feel like I can really confide to any of them. No idea why. I just feel like they will hurt me if I tell them. They have in the past. I know that was high school. I know high school sucks. But I can't help myself.Dated 4 girls so far. Had my heart broken 4 times. One of them even stole my credit card after the breakup, along with money. Nowadays I barely talk to women. But I want to love and feel loved. I want to have a family, settle down and live a normal life. I've always wanted to. Lately I've been focusing on school and work. But every day I feel worse and worse. Last night I got blackout drunk. Didn't help. Made me feel even worse. I know that my loneliness comes mostly from my conscious decisions. Can't live with people, can't live without them.The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I fear the pain. "
8th grade,I�۪m in 8th grade and already contemplating this shit  the reason I have been thinking about this is I have anxiety and depression that never seems to go away I can�۪t talk to my parents about it because they have my other two brothers to worry about so the only way to help myself is to hurt them and I don�۪t think I can do that and I�۪m afraid to reach out to a friend cause I feel like we could never have a normal conversation again then there�۪s the fact that I know I�۪m going to grow up to be a man child who at best is a manager of a bar or gas station even though I want to do something with science but even the thought of responsibility scares me I have all Fs in my core classes because we just moved and I feel my parents are slowly giving up on me I just can�۪t take this shit anymore
The time has finally come.,"I'm finally ready to end it all. After 25 years of a sickening life, i'm ready to end it all. I should have done it earlier, but my life was all about coping. I'll die with depression and as an involutary celibate (thought of resorting to sex work before death, but I have no motivation for that). I'll die in the city (The Invicta) I love the most, and where I was born. The bridge is 75 meters tall, so it should be enough to kill me if I fall on concrete. Goodbye meaningless world."
What now...?,"so, im 17, and im in my last year of high school. as things go, ive been always credited on my academia, apparently im pretty clever but this hasn't ever been something i've cared about. so i had to apply to uni and shit, and everyone's excited for me, but i'm not. why? because im not going to make it to next year when the time comes. im sitting in all my lessons fucking doing nothing because all i can think about is ""should i do it today? how am i going to do it? why has my life come to this?""  ive been to doctors, counsellors, the school, all umpteen times and everyone just sends me back to each other, bouncing me from pillar to post. everyone knows i want to kill myself but nobody really.. acknowledges it.
as though even if i did it, it would just be.. inevitable.  and nobody would give a shit. which is true. and i'm fucking sick. it's been like 3 years of suicidal thoughts but over time they've become disgustingly close to becoming reality and im fucking scared. i just want to die yknow. maybe i will."
I don't know why I keep trying,"A couple weeks ago I was happier than I've ever been. I was at my college, a beautiful place I love where I have tons of friends, basically living my dream considering I've had social problems all throughout middle-high school. Then to make a long story short the student financial department fucked me and my parents over and I was uprooted from my friends and the place I was living in the middle of the week, they literally forced me to leave. It was awful, and it's actually not the first time something similar has happened to me before. Now I am home (my college is 7 hours away) in a place where I have no friends, no job, and not even taking classes. I have no one to talk to, I still talk to my friends from school but I can't talk about stuff like this or it'll freak them out. I used to see a therapist but my mom doesn't want to pay for it anymore and I have no money. My home life has always been incredibly toxic and my parents have always been a major contributor to my depression and anxiety. I just feel like...worthless. Like a worthless individual. I don't have a job and I'm not doing anything and I have no motivation to even leave the house let alone my bed. All my life shit like this has continued to happen to me and sometimes I look at all the pills I have to take and consider just shoving a handful in my mouth and ending it all, but most of the time I just lie in my bed and wish I could die without actually having to kill myself because I'm a coward. I'm so tired of hearing that things are gonna get better because for me "
running out of option,"it physically hurts to breathe. i have no dream or goal or ambition or motivation. im tried it all. ive been to hospital, er, psyche ward, therapist, difference medications. my girlfriend, the only person i really loved who wasnt family wants to just up and go do drugs and drink or whatever the fuck, leaving me here with nothing. so i cant at least just talk to her any more about how i feel. it hurts. it hurts so much. so much pain and why? i dont know. why was i born to suffer like this? if god is real, he wants me dead. and i do too"
I want everyone to feel my pain,"I'm sick of everyone trying to hold me down and take advantage of me. I'm sick of always being second choice, I'm sick of being neglected, feared, and hated. I want everyone to feel my wrath and my pain. I'm sick of hiding in the shadows and just taking it all.
I want everything they ever did to me to happen to them and 100 times over. I hope they never get relief. I'm sick of people and I'm not afraid to admit it. And it makes me sick to see so many happy people with perfect lives. They don't deserve it. If I can't be happy, why should anyone else be?"
I cannot wait for my mum to f*cking die,"all i wait is for her to die. then im going to lie under the train that very day.
i cannot learn english. ive had to learn it all my life to be able to write poetry, stories. it is artificial language to me, a languge for game (and i want to play , i want to be a child forever and to create and play my own games, to live virtual lives). i hate my morher fu*king russian language because it's real and because all what i loved - music and books - all is done in english. my unrequited love, Dasha (its girl name) whom i ve loved 6 years (six!!!! without being able to talk with her via skypoe at least because she ignores me because im a pervert) has proficiency in english, has that fu0king C2 certificate, she is a teacher she is a grownup person she works in an IT company as a english teacher for these damned programmers (and her 28yo boyfriend is a programmer). and i cannot move from this plane of knowledge with which im writing now 2 years. in fact i don't learn language at all. because i m fu9king depressed all the time. im fucking sit with a grimace of anguish on my face all days. i want my Dasha i want to be friends with her i want to return back and be forever child to live over and over again that period from 13-to 20 years of age. that b0tch my mum don't die. i cannot wait , i would kill her to be able to kill myself sooner, but we are two in a very intimate relationship, in short i cant kill her. guns are forbiden in my country, i've got only a knife or a brick to do it and so i cant do it, it s very bloody and slow method.  cannot do anything. my tonsils stink, i hate human stench in all forms (except Dasha's shit's), i hate my body, hate arteries, these nose and lips and saliva and eyes and all. i hate human body except Dasha's one.  i want to fu0k and to be with my Dasha. and i want to speak english and write poetry and to want to compose music again like in my youth and to be young again."
"Codeine, ativan, sleep meds, alcohol. Tell me why I shouldnt.",Hopeless. Im ready to give up
I'm just a mess.,I ran out of meds and I haven't had the strength or energy to go refill them. I went to class today and ended up sitting on a sidewalk ugly crying and making people think I'm a fucking headcase. All I do is sleep and I never feel rested. I'm alone in a new town and I have no friends and all I want is someone to sit with me and talk a while. I'm hanging in there because I brought my cats here to this strange place and I can't just leave them to think they've been abandoned. I just took a three hour nap and all I got was a headache and still tired. I have no clean laundry my room is a clusterfuck I haven't combed my hair in days or eaten and instead of doing things that need done I'm lying here trying to avoid intrusive self harm thoughts. I'm lazy and awful and I can't get myself to stop it.
I hate feelings,"At this point, I think I am clinging onto life, waiting for the right set of circumstances to just let go. My feelings keep holding me back. I hate them. I hate having to feel. I hate each and every one of them. There's something comforting about the idea of nonexistence. Something comforting about the idea of nothing. I long for it."
I just want to sleep.,"So much has gone wrong in these 20 years, and it's still getting worse. I can't change most of what is going on around me, but it will invariably affect me. I don't want to give it the chance. So if I go, and sleep, and don't wake up I won't have to deal with it."
Standing in supermarket line...,"...and thinking how does it feel to jump off a high story building. I've read stories that during the fall it makes you feel alive due to sudden surge of adrenaline. Okay lets back to supermarket..few more people to go... then thinking will this ever stop, feeling like total zombie.Got out of store, sit on public bus. Thinking how I'm institutionalized and tied to hospital bed in psych wards..lol okay I'm back in the bus...Okay I'm dealing with this crap for 5 years. I totally have no energy remaining. I have job that requires working part time from home. Okay I do my job and fall asleep immediately. Last session my psych told me that there is no working medicine for me because we try'ed everything. (lol-only couple diff. ssri's & benzos and low dose pregabalin which made me feel more worse).Currently on low dose of ssri and benzo. How to cope with this?
I get entertained sometimes when watching live stream of gamers online or playing some game but not for long.My real word productivity is literally 0.I go sometimes out for a drink with friends. Feeling like depersonalized shit begging from inside that they stop talking to me sometimes because i have no power to engage in conversation.Blab,blah thanks for reading. How to cope with this"
I'm worried I might lose it tomorrow.,"I can't really tell anyone for fear of worrying them. I moved into a new apartment last year, bills were tight, I accidentally let my car insurance lapse, which led to my registration being suspended. I was pulled over for a minor traffic offense that led to my car being towed and getting ticketed for driving on suspended registration without insurance. I set up a court case to hopefully plead my case to the judge and set up a payment plan and hopefully not lose my license, I don't believe it's mandatory in my state.If I lose my license tomorrow, I will lose my job, I will lose my apartment, I will have nothing. I also have one year and eleven moths clean and sober tomorrow. I'm going to be off my methadone maintenance program in two weeks. But if I lose my license tomorrow, I lose everything, I drive for work, I can't lose it.If the worst happens, I've basically decided I'll have nothing left to live for. I'll be homeless and jobless, exactly where I was two years ago when I was homeless and addicted to heroin. I won't be able to do it all over again after working so hard. I'm going to walk home from the court, pack all my things and clean my apartment and say my goodbyes. It's just too much. I'm really hoping it doesn't come to that. I hope so fucking much. I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to do that to anyone. I'm not strong enough to start over again. My chest feels like it's going to explode with anxiety. I feel like I'm going to break down crying in front of the judge tomorrow practically pleading for my life. Please, somebody tell me it'll be okay."
Death cant be much worse surely?,I'm 22 male. My girlfriend left. I've been staying late in the office for too long because I can't cope with the workload.Friends are non existent.Hate my family and they hate me. I just want to die I don't see any other option at this point
Every day just brings me closer to the death,"I m 21 y/o working student, i want to kill myself, life is unbearable. I have no skills not talents and im absolutely boring person so i spend most of my free time alone. I really want to find a girlfriend but i see no way how could i find one when im useless like this. I used to go away from sadness by listening to music but these days i m bored of music and just want to go to sleep and never wake up. "
Please forgive me. I tried to get help,I don't know what else to say. I am tired of being a burden on everyone else. I am tired of everyone writing me off. I can't help who I am and I have tried to get help. I have a plan and in a few weeks I will no longer be a part of this world.
Trying this to vent; dont know what to do anymore,"First of all I want to say that English isnt my native language so please forgive any mistakes I make.I am trying this a sort of last resort. In the last 10 years (I am almost 21 now) I have experienced in those years many beautiful and precious moments, but also horrible ones. I was bullied (in I think extreme ways) for 3 years and that fucked me up for a while: depression, therapy and the like. That was the first time I was suicidal and I also thought that was my rock bottom. I changed schools and I lost weight and made many friends. Those 2 years were the best of my life. I got a girlfriend that left me after 2 years in really mean way. I also made mistakes but the way she left me (she deliberately made my life hell) made me think about ending it again. That brings us to last year. I chose a gap year because I didnt know what to study. I also applied for a job which I got. It's a job for students so the whole ambiance is very social (our own pub and partys and the like). That job dragged me right out of that depression and I made so many friends. Months later, I met a girl (a sister of a colleague haha) and she rocked my world. Of course I have friends to whom I can say everything, but she was something else. She knows everything about me, and I know everything about her. The sister is also one of my closest friends I have. But M (the girl) stills lives at her parents and 2 hours away. So one day we excited to meet in secret (parents were away) and we ended up having sex. Until this day the sister doesnt know it. We met a second time and we seriously fell in love. But she lives 2 hours away, her parents are abusive, she is not in a good place too. The big sister is in a depression so if she finds out about this, well lets say that it wont end well. M chose to end things, not because of me; 'she was never so in love as with me' but because she thinks that the relationship isnt gonna work. My reaction to this was drinking and partying everyday. Im drunk almost every evening. I lost my job (and thus also the social things with the job) because of this and some other shit.
I simply dont know what to do anymore. Everything is failing. Im failing my classes. Im a burden to my parents and friends, also to M because al those people are gonna go to shit because of my pain. I cant end myself because I will fuck their lives up. But I want it so damn bad. Every minute not drinking is living hell. I am a failure"
Just got in a car accident and I wish it had been worse,"Earlier this morning it was raining, not too hard but not light. I was just trying to get to class but at an intersection I needed to stop quickly, but the car wouldn't because the road was slick. I crashed into another person's car, and I realized as I sat there after it happened that I wasn't scared. I was upset that I made a mistake and almost hurt someone else, but at the same time I wish it had been worse and that I had gotten fatally injured.When I'm driving sometimes I imagine just crashing into something, and dying. I've had some close calls recently with other drivers and I often think afterward that I wish they had ended up hitting me. I don't know why I feel like this. I've been taking Sertraline, the generic version of Zoloft, which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day to day basis, but whenever something out of the ordinary happens like this car accident or I mess something up it's like I had never taken the meds.I feel like I both want to and don't want to die. These last couple of years have been horrible for me, but I still have dreams and want to do things. Before I started taking the Sertraline I was actively planning my death, but now it's like I feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much. This car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money, and it's all my fault. Maybe they would have gotten some compensation if I had died. If I wasn't around anymore, they'd be sad, but I also wouldn't be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymore. I'm a terrible daughter."
My dad might be suicidal,"A few years ago I found a list with statements like ""do you ever feel empty"" and you had to pick a number from 1-5 depending how you feel about it. I found these documents in my dads home office along with a funeral speech he wrote about his own funeral. It was something along the lines of ""In a few generations no one will remember him"" etc. This was a years ago, I copied everything and it's still in my old room. I was still a teenager at this time. In my teens up to my 20s I had depression. Like a lots of families we have never talked about mental illness and it took me 5 years to admit I was in therapy. There wasn't really a reaction from my parents to it. If I didn't say anything about it we would have never addressed it again. I don't think they didn't care but they didn't know what to say. Move on a few years I'm doing fine again. I was having a chat with my parents and my dad said he is now engaging in some kind of gun club (owing a gun is illegal in my country - you need to join a gun club, be active there and do a training). I asked why he's doing that he said I thought about it for a long time and now he just went for it. My dad is really liberal and if I asked him 2-3 years ago about guns he would say that he would never use one and he was really anti-guns in general. I asked him a bit more about it and he said he's planning on storing guns at home (for which you need even more training and stuff). Later he commented that only he had access to it and might need it a day. The point is: it's really nothing my dad would have ever done. It might be some kind of midlife crises but maybe it's not. The comment ""I need them some day"" was really weird and out of place (they don't live in a dangerous area at  all and even if they did his general opinion would have been that guns don't help that). I don't know if he ever had therapy or something but it seems so. He's been looking really happy these days which is also confusing. Something seems off but maybe I'm just overthinking.Could use some advice on whether to address this or not and how to do it. Thanks in advance. "
Looking for someone to talk to,"Hello,18yo guy here looking for someone to talk to.Thanks a lot in advance"
(16/m) will probably kill myself before 2018,"Ive always been depressed, as long as i can remember.  Summers are better but school always makes it much worse.  I probably would have tried to kill myself last may if i had a car.  Now i do.  Last may was the worst its ever been, i transferred to an early college program so im taking classes at the CC instead of my shitass high school.  Ive only been in school for two weeks and its progressing way faster than normal.  Idk why i want to die, nothing traumatic has happened to me, but i do, i hate myself so much, ill probably CO myself if this doesnt get better soon."
"If I'm not happy by age 25-30, I think it's best that I just die.","I am 19 years old. I've had anxiety my entire life and depression since I was 12, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years. Add misophonia to that and it makes life torture. It's especially bad now because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in life. The only reason I have to live is for my friends and family, and because I'm too scared to die (which is ironic because I wish I was dead most of the time, or at least I wish I'd never been born). But life is scary, too. Anyway. If things don't get better in the next 5-10 years, then I fucking quit. Or maybe I'll pussy out like the pathetic, piece of shit coward I am. I don't know. "
I sexually harassed my crush. I feel like there is no place for me in the world.,"For a long time now, about half a year, I have been touching my crush (who isn't interested in me) without consent. I work alongside him, and we are both part of a very tight group of friends so he has to see me every day. And every single time, I try to touch him, stare at him and sometimes even take pictures of him. Only recently I have realized the implications of what I have done and that I am hurting him. I feel like I betrayed him and myself for doing something that is completely against all my values. I want to change, and I know I can, but I'm afraid I will lose the will to live if I can't get myself to stop touching him. "
I think my moment is coming,"It seems that the pieces of my life are already set, it seems that fate so wants, my mom will leave the house for a while for her work, seems to be my opportunity to be free, nobody cares if I die, every day I get up and I think about suicide and how to carry it out, I wish I had a gun. I think I'll find a way to do it, I've already lost everything, I can not enjoy my music like before, the girl I like is in love with someone else, I have no friends and I never had a girlfriend, that disgust of life, maybe is better leave this place. "
I'm getting close and I am not sure what to do anymore.,"I have been really struggeling for about 5 month now. I broke up with someone who I loved very much. I first turned to drinking and drugs to ease the pain but I got quite suicidal. It got so bad I had to make some major changes in my life or I didn't think I was going to make it. I have done absolutely everything I can to pick myself up. Therapy, psychiatrist, lexapro, quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out, started eating right, started travelling, focused on work and even started hobbies. Despite all this somet It feels like nothing is helping. I can barely get out of bed most days. I'm on the verge of tears every day. It is difficult to do anthing. It's even hard to write this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up everyday feeling like I am being tortured. It's been 5 months and It is driving me nuts feeling like I can't escape. I could really use some words of wisdom right now"
I don't know anymore.,"I don't know anymore. These 4 words make my life a living hell, no matter who I say it to. In the sudden absence of happiness, I know only sadness. I have nothing to look forward to because I've fucked my chances up at even having something decent. No job, no girlfriend, and absolutely nothing to motivate me. At this point I don't even know why I'm still alive, it pains me I even am alive."
"My life has no purpose, I am broke, lonely and miserable. I'm so done.","I'm not going into too many details mainly because from experience people will take one factoid, make up a whole bunch of stuff in their head and judge you harshly for it, or assume things due to lack of context.But my life is a sack of shit. My family legitimately hate me
I am poor
I have some friends, but don't hear from them unless I get in touch first
I have been single for almost a decade. Generally I am ok with being single but some dates wouldn't go amiss.I literally care about nothing any more. My dreams and goals seem like stupid things that I am not good enough to achieve. I've tried, but depression grinds my world to a halt.Doctors don't help me
Nobody around me seems to understandThis has gone on for 30+ years. I am tired. cant do it any more.I just want to lay down and die quietly. All I want in life is to disappear."
I am going to kill myself right now,I'm sorry you are feeling so desperate.I'm here if you would like to talk first.Amy
i want to die Where can i go to commit Suicide??,give me an injection as i am unconconscious and end my Nightmare life. I WANT TO DIE
No other option,"I'm a 21 y/o female clerk at a convienience store. I've worked with the company for a year and a half. I spent most of that time in a store located in the worst part of the hood. I am very small and not an assertive person. I am technically a PT Sales Clerk but have been doing the work of a FT Assistant Manager. I'm not trying to brag either, it sucks and I never asked for it. I work 40-50 hours or more a week, and handle training employees and shift supervision as well as office work. I was also told while at the bad store that I had no such thing as availability, and that I wasn't allowed benefits. They lied and gave me a package set to expire in two weeks. I couldn't get it back to them in time and now I need to wait two years for my next chance to apply apparently.During my time at the hood store, I was poked with hypodermic needles and had to have blood work done due to it. In the first week I worked there, a senior citizen employee on graveyard shift nearly had his eye cut out with a pizza cutter by a guy on meth. I have also I've been followed home and threatened while at work by gang members that they will cut me up into pieces and leave me in the river. The police never helped us really, they'd give the hood rats a talking to but then they'd come back and threaten you more for calling the cops. I was also the only first aid person on staff, I am an emergency first responder. Near the end of my working there, a man who was known in the area for massive theft and violence overdosed while in the station and smashed his face into a corner of a table. We'd had 4 overdoses prior that week, so I was ready to deal with it. When I went to help him, he couldn't tell it was me and swung at my face before passing out in a sitting position. He had himself up on a chair so I had to hold him to stop him from falling, but he was easily twice or three times my size and I was terrified now since he had gotten violent. I had to scream and beg my coworkers to call 911 and they refused. Another customer had to help me. Once I was free from his care by handing him off to the fire department, my uniform and my arms were covered in blood from his head. I was given a new shirt, but since it was only a half hour into my shift, I was made to stay all night, with blood all over my leggings since they said it'd take too long for me to at least go home and change.I also had a middle aged Field Consultant who was pulling me into the corners f the store with no cameras and telling me that he was going to take me on a two person road trip six hours away so I could train people at a bunch of stores for three weeks, when I hadn't agreed to something like that, and told me not to tell my bosses about it, because I needed to prove I was worth a promotion by proving I could keep my mouth shut. This set off alarm bells, especially when the assistant manager at the time stated that she had watched him on the camera system following me around the store staring directly at me for a full hour. When I confessed all he was saying to my boss and assistant manager, the boss confronted him as was fired instantly. I watched him fire her through the front windows of the store. She moved o my city from across the province to manage our store, and I ruined it and got her fired. The assistant manager was fired next for other reasons. I left the store after the overdose incident, though it was partially to get away from this man as another guy runs the other stores in two.Now my new job at the same company is in an affluent location, but everyone is rude and I've had a father point at my face and tell his kids that I was a great example of why you pay attention in class. So you wouldn't end up like me. All in all though, my new job is so much better, safer. It hasn't done me wrong yet really. But I've started seeing people that were regulars from my old work back, and they recognize me. I'm terrified. I vomit and feel terrified before going to work because all I can think of was my old job. I feel a crushing sense of dread and anxiety, and it's overflowed so much that I want to kill myself the moment I step in the door of that place.My doctor and an employee therapist urged 6-8 weeks of stress leave since my doctor thinks that the stress is 'literally killing me', which I don't believe, and my therapist says my conditions were extraordinary, but I don't think so. Nobody else that works for corner stores or gas stations goes on stress leave, old ladies and essentially worthless skin sacks can work there, so why can't I? Why am I so weak that I can't keep up? Besides, it's not my new jobs fault that I'm feeling this way so why should I punish them by going on a leave?I'm supposed to be better than this. At this point, I'm so terrified of taking stress leave that now I'm starting to be convinced killing myself is the only option. My doctor has me on meds, probably because I'm crazy. I don't know. I don't have any friends either, or a family support net, so don't with that friend shit. And all I have is my boyfriend to talk to but this isn't his problem, I won't saddle him with my weakness. I'm a shit person, I deserve this."
BF is suicidal... but not sad or depressed?,"So... my boyfriend has been in a suicide rehab center for the last month. He says that he's just over life. He's not sad, not depressed, generally enjoys stuff, but is also just over it all. He says it would just be easier to be dead. Now, I've never heard of anything like this before, I haven't been with a guy who's been suicidal, but I do have a friend who was in the Army who battles with depression and ""dark thoughts"" all the time... but I feel like this is a whole different animal. My army friend owns firearms, is well off financially, but dealing with things from his service time falls into depression a few times a year, but has never tried to take his life (given that he has firearms, I'm surprised.) But.. my boyfriend on the other hand, isn't depressed... isn't sad... is still doing all of the things he loves, sports, video games, occasional trip to the bar, etc. and usually seems like he's in a really good mood...  but for some reason he just doesn't feel the need to be here anymore. It's been a really difficult thing for me to understand, and it's starting to take a toll on me. (Not that I'm getting suicidal, but I'm just confused, having never dealt with this situation... I just don't understand how anyone can possibly think that way?)Has anyone else dealt with this before and if so.. what/how did you approach it? "
"If I tell a psychiatrist that I'm suicidal, will they immediately have me shipped away and handcuffed to a bed?",I always lie.
Too many things out of my control,"Hi,Thanks for clicking. My apologies for venting on the internet, I just had no idea where else to go. In fact, I should be studying for tomorrow's exam.I am a upperclassman in college who has been suicidal since high school. This is likely due to the fact that I suffer from depression yet there are so many impeding factors in my life that are dragging me down by the neck.A lot of people refer to college as the best time of their lives yet I am completely wasting it. Every weekend I am by myself in my room wasting time on the internet, or doing homework. I do not have a social life and I am so socially stunted that I do not know how to build one.Academically, I am performing well for the most part. Unfortunately, I managed to get three WDs on my transcript because I refused to play the stupid game putting up with classes taught by terrible professors. I refused to stay in a place where the professors were of no help. I attempted a second STEM major along with my current STEM major because my school offers a program where I would have gone to an IVY League school for two years after my senior year. I gave up on the program during my second semester in it leaving me feeling like a complete failure.Sleeping is difficult for me. Recently it has become easier but before it took such an incredibly long time for me to fall asleep. At one point I resorted to hitting my head against the wall to make myself ""sleepy.""I'm undocumented in the USA. Because of certain circumstances, I cannot renew my DACA and will begin accruing illegal time when March roles around. I lived in this country for 17 years and there is the danger I will be kicked out of my home. My parents are undocumented too. If they get caught and deported while I'm at college (which is in a different state) there will be no one left at home to take care of little siblings who are American born citizens.Because I am undocumented at a conservative college, a lot of students publicly hate immigrants like me though they do not know of my status. This impedes against me going out to socialize. I can't go to parties because I cannot enjoy the activities without fear of getting caught, arrested, and deported because I am underage.One way to solve my immigrant status would be to get sponsorship. I have been interning at a prestigious company for two summers now and have been offered a third internship. I was hoping to do well enough at this internship to get hired and later become sponsored but because my DACA is expiring, I will be unable work in the USA by summertime.I am infatuated with an undocumented girl. I cannot even attempt to build a romantic relationship with her because marriage is another way to attain a pathway to citizenship. I do NOT want to get married for papers but for love. It just sucks that I have to force myself to lose my infatuation with this girl and move one so I can eventually marry an American citizen assuming I can find someone desperate enough to marry me.My life is a soap opera cliche. Turns out I have a half-sibling. I found out about this sibling after I started college. One parent cheated on the other and they were born. It is possible my cheating parent is sending them money to attend the most expensive university in my home country while they study for a fucking COMMUNICATIONS major.Therapy isn't helping. I'm currently on another type of antidepressants because the last ones failed. My counselor constantly tells me about the plethora of positive qualities I possess ranging from intelligence to empathy. Yet every time I feel an iota of hope or positivity, it quickly evaporates.I have this unnatural fear that I will be forgotten when I die. This keeps me from trying anything because I keep reverting to the same thought of ""What's the point?""To conclude, I am so fucking scared of everything. I do not know what my future brings if it will actually bring anything at all. I find myself miserable in my home state, my college state, and I know I will be miserable in my home country if I get deported. Is there any advice or hope that someone can offer without repeating the same asinine rhetoric that gets tossed around?"
I need help,"This is not about me directly. A girlfriend in another country has had a family member a 19 Yo boy, the son of her sister commit suicide yesterday. 1 year ago the brother of her sister's husband also committed suicide. She herself has told me she has struggled with suicidal thoughts. The whole family is 1 day into this. How do I suggest they all get counseling without sounding like a busy body.
The complexity is we were recconnecting via email after a 7 year absence from each others lives. Making plans to visit and now this.
I don't expect her to answer my emails right now and maybe never.
I am worried about her primarily but I think the whole family may need some counseling now with 2 people in 2 years.
Her sister is a palliative care nurse so she has dealt with loss but this is much different. Her son. For my girlfriend its a bitter loss because she can not have children. Her first email to me said.""What did we do that was so bad? ''  I am miles away I knew she would say no but I had to ask if she needed me to come to be there for her. I know she will be there for her sister and the rest of the family but my selfish urge was to want to be there for her.
I am not sure what to do. I feel like everything we were planning is just over now. Its a big family for her a dozen kids dotted around the country. They will all be getting together now for the worst of all possible reasons. 19 years old and gone. We are much older in our 40's and  mid 50's but still this is going to be a very sad year or two.
Any help with an approach that is appropriate would be appreciated"
Didn�۪t kill myself yet,I guess that�۪s something to be proud of. I had a gun but my roommate found it. Planning on finding a lonely bridge to end it. I really want a reason to live but I just can�۪t find one.
"In Debt, Will kill myself Thursday. (22/Male)","I've been unemployed for almost 2 years and I currently live with my parents. I have $600 in overdraft fees that's going to double every 4 days. I have no idea what to do. Last time I tried to kill myself it was when I was 18. I have no friends that i can turn to. The idea of my parents finding me dead breaks my heart. But my depression + this debt is making me lose my mind. To top it all off, I have social anxiety and haven't left my house in about 2 years. I'm going to try to sell some things to see if I can make $600 (on ebay) but I don't think it will be possible in four days. I'm irresponsible and a waste. i plan on writing a suicide letter today and get rid of some personal items tomorrow. On Thursday I'm going to stab myself in the stomach or take a lot of pills. I'm not sure which to do yet. Sorry for spelling and grammar. I'm sure nobody here cares anyways. "
I shouldn't want to kill myself,"I have so many advantages in life. All of my immediate family is alive and still involved in my life. I have several friends who I frequently talk to. I make more than enough money to live on easily.But every night I go home and drink, hoping I'll forget about how much I just want it all to end. Every single moment that I'm sober I spend thinking that people might actually see me for who I really am; a lazy waste of space who lucked into success. And when I'm drunk I worry that people will find out that I'm trying to slowly kill myself with alcohol.Fuck. I always thought if I could just be successful I'd be happy. Well I am, and I'm not."
I'm not safe with myself,"I've been suicidal for a while now. I've made 4 attempts this year.And yet, nobody seems to get it.Last Thursday, my parents picked me up from my appointment and had brought my brother along. They'd gone out to eat while they were waiting, and no mention of lunch was made. We basically didn't have anything at home to eat, so I skipped lunch.It's not unusual for me to skip meals, but this time, I went completely off the rails. I took a shower, then, thinking my parents had gone out, went to their room. Why? To get the medications that it's possible to reliably lethally overdose on. They were there, but I played it off as nothing.I can't afford to be hospitalized. If I don't succeed in killing myself, I'll end up having to withdraw from my classes and lose financial aid. I don't have any other source of income, and I need that money if I plan on living.I met up with one of my few friends the day before yesterday (after 6 months of not talking). I've been talking regularly to another. I haven't discussed this with them, except when one of them found me talking about it through a semi-anonymous account and brought it up. ""I'm okay now,"" and that was that.I don't know what to do. I  want to die. I can't feel anything for anyone. There's nothing I want to do. I'm an emotional wreck, and I've been skipping classes.At this point, bringing up suicide doesn't help anything. Everyone's just annoyed by how needy I am���even the psychiatrist has an edge in her voice while she asks me if I want to up my medications.I honestly can't say if I'm going to kill myself today. I keep breaking down, crying, and I don't know why.I hate myself for this. Everyone I know just sucks it up and deals with it. One of my friends has been cutting for a while now, due to abusive relationships with her family, but hasn't attempted suicide in years. I just don't understand how someone can tolerate it with only something so minor to cope. Two of my siblings have been dealing with depression untreated for years, I don't even know how long, and they only bring it up when I do.I don't want people to be angry at me. I hate conflict. I freeze up and can't do anything. I just have to smile and pretend nothing happened. I just have to be someone else. I just have to say, ""I'm okay, really."" the day after an unsuccessful overdose. I can't deal with it anymore. If people are going to be angry at me anyway, I'd rather succeed."
Feeling numb,Hate my job. I hate waking up everyday. I feel nothing. Feel like I�۪m on auto-pilot. I got dumped 3 months ago (almost) from a 4 year relationship. Nothing cheers me up anymore. My parents are in another state so I just can�۪t go see them whenever I want.I don�۪t know if I could actually end it myself but I do dream of other ways like a car hitting me and killing me instantly. I sometimes think of just taking a bunch of pills and letting that be it but idk if I could put my family through that. I just want something good to finally fucking happen for me but it never does. And I�۪m so tired of getting my hopes up. I�۪m a 25 year old guy who is tired of it all.
Bipolar,"I have bipolar 2 disorder, and I have become hyper aware of my mood swings, they get bad enough where I can barely get out of bed, talk to my friends, or even work, and during the manic episodes I don't sleep, maybe 3-4 hours a night, my mind races, I make highly unrealistic goals. And then get hit again with the crippling depression, I've been living like this since high school, 5 years later I'm still living in the same loop. I'm well-medicated now, but the mood/personality swings have really been talking their toll on me, I'm very aware of them, and it only makes sense that my friends and roommates are also aware, no one says anything, nor do they act any differently, but I can sense their apprehension to ask me to do anything. The worst part about it, I feel like I should be able to stop the swings, I try to be in control, but it's like a dream where you're stuck in quicksand and dry ground is just in front of you, but you can move, you're paralyzed, forced to watch yourself drown"
I think it's tonight.,"Because I don't care and I have nothing left. I don't care. I had something so great, so promising and they stripped it down past the bone into splinters then pissed on the splinters. I don't want happiness. I don't want dreams. I don't care that if I post a note everyone will desperately try to stop me. I know they'll care when I'm about to die, or dead. That's about where the line is drawn. I have nothing worth struggling for. I'm not a good person. I don't care to try anymore. I tried to live every day good and dreaming and it led me here. It didn't stop me from being a massive cunt.I am numb, I am no longer scared, and the hurt is too much. I gotta go. I have nothing left. I had a lot of love to give. But its gone with me. I just wanted someone to hear me before the end. "
I want to kill myself but I'm afraid to die,"I have been dealing with this pain for about 3 years. I have seen many therapists and have tried medication. Nothing has worked. I told my parents tonight that I wanted to commit suicide and it has caused nothing but chaos in my house. I have been looking online for ways to die and have figured that drinking and taking medication is the way to go for me. I have already been drinking but have been hesitant to take medication because I am scared to die. I do not believe in god. I do not know what comes after death. I am scared of pain and afraid that it will hurt and i will not succeed. I have tried reaching out to my ex-boyfriend who told me that he does not wish to help me. He hates me. I called him and told him how I was feeling and he said ""I don't care, I'm eating so I'm going to finish dinner""....... it made me sick that someone could have no compassion towards a human life. I've had a hard childhood, both my mom and dad were addicted to narcotics and were hardly there for me. For some reason my brother and sister have turned out ok. I am the youngest at 23 and have been struggling with depression and been keeping it a secret since middle school. I'm writing this because I don't know what to do or where to turn to."
I can�۪t do this anymore.,"I have no hope. I�۪m a senior in college, and I just want to die. I don�۪t fit in, and I feel like no one cares about me. Everyday I wake up and I try to tell myself that today is a new day, but it doesn�۪t work. I hate everything about myself, and I feel so alone. I have no one. I don�۪t care how I look and I don�۪t even want to get up in the mornings. I just want to end it all. End all the suffering and the pain. I just want to feel nothing ��� for my anxiety and depression to leave me alone. I don�۪t know where to turn, but I just can�۪t keep doing this anymore. "
Stuck.,Every time I try and kill myself I can't go through with it but I can't keep living feeling this way. Why can't I just let myself die.
My current Situation...,"If you don't mind reading it would help very much. But here is my current situation right now...
So to start off, I am in college working a part time job (that I absolutely hate) at a restaurant. I was usually the nice, quiet, hardworking one, but I have been there for two miserable years. My attitude towards people in general has spiraled downward all because I have seen cheap people who don't tip or tip so little that many like myself cant make decent money to pay for school. I work with former thugs, drug addicts and people who just had lots of bad luck to where they are stuck needing to work at a restaurant where they make less than minimum wage. For myself I make $5 an hour including an uncertain amount of money in tips. Sometimes its higher, most times its relatively low.
When I show up to work, which is two 5-6 hour shifts every weekend, I usually ignore my main boss. Im afraid of him. All he cares about is the status quo. He essentially makes the servers lie and market themselves in such a fashion that the servers purpose is to make people sell things to people that they dont need or want. Im a busser, so normally I dont interact with customers, but sometimes I really get depressed, especially when I see my friends from a catholic high school I went to show up in my restaurant. The reuniting of two former high school classmates in a situation like that can be awkward. Almost all of them that I have talked to are married, have their degrees and because of their degree, have great jobs. Its been 5 years since I left high school and it really seems like they have their lives in order. From the looks of it, they sound free and at peace.
I however, still live with my parents. My father keeps asking how much longer I have until I'm done with college. This also depresses me because he never went to college let alone graduate high school. I feel he can never ever understand the amount of struggling and painful sacrifice I have made to my mind and body to get ever closer to a Computer Science degree. I have taken classes that I have done well in. Some I have had to retake. But the ones I retake, especially the senior level classes are only offered one semester out of the entire year. This means, you either understand it in the time frame its allowed or you don't. Don't get it? Well tough luck. Try again next time. There goes about $1000 dollars down the drain. When I explain this to my father he nags at me because he thinks I am lazy. I cry on the inside because I cant seem to explain to my dad my points to him whenever he asks how long I have until I am done with college. My mother is the only one who even comes close to understanding this. She went to college, although it was for business administration. Shes worked and put up with public school education for 26 years and retires next year. She also doesn't seem to understand how hard my major is at least for me. She wont let me take it at my own steady pace so that I wont be overwhelmed with things to cram for an exam.
I also have a girlfriend who I love. We have dated for 4 years. In fact we just celebrated our anniversary last month. I almost cried in bitter anger when I realized that she had a Trichotillomaniac moment and cut off all her hair off. All I remember feeling was... I have held on with her mental habit for 4 years. We had worked so hard together to let her natural hair take over from all that suffering she went through. Now its starting all over. I almost dumped her. She wears a wig everywhere we go and when someone comments on how pretty her hair looks, I feel so tempted to say that its not real. I am afraid that if my father knew about it he would cause my girlfriend a lot of pain.
In terms of suicide I am not really there. But some days I feel so depressed I don't wanna get out of bed. There is such a stigma against people talking about depression because of the modern way we see mental illness. I could never say to my parents that I am depressed because they will just tell me to ""tough it up"" or ""thats life"" or god forbid send me off to a psychiatrist like there is something so wrong with me that Ill be shunned from my family or viewed as weak.
The only ally I feel sometimes gets me is my cat. He just shows purrfect love to me and everyone else in the house. He licks my fingers and toes. He even lets me hold him like a baby. Then he will just stare at me with his one eye, like the whole universe, for that moment is at peace.
Finally, sometimes I do zen meditation and do yoga to try and recognize why I sometimes get depressed. I try to do with with the intention of practicing letting go and to realize that there are others out there who are in similar situations like my own. Maybe not exactly but close.
I wanna hear your guys experiences. Just post them here. I will be supportive just as much as Reddit allows a community to allow discussions about topics like this."
My time,I feel like my time is coming soon. Like I�۪m running out of time. I�۪ve had enough and I�۪m ready to call it quits. I�۪ve attempted before but this time I can�۪t afford to fail. I have many different pills and other ways I can end it. I just need to figure out the best time when. Maybe tonight maybe tomorrow. Who knows
"With my financial situation getting worse, so does my mental health. Suicide is my Plan Z and I feel like I'm about to reach Plan Z.","Long story short, I failed my degree, can't afford to retake the subjects and I am now left with a huge loan and being unable to provide for my family. I did freelance work to cover my bills and now I think I'm on the verge of losing that job. I've been trying to look for a job for the past 5 months or so and I had no luck. My debt is piling, others are climbing in their life and I'm stuck here. It's absolutely my fault I'm in this situation. I'm going to a couple of conferences and I have spoken to some employers but if they don't work out (I'm fully expecting it not to, things always go to shit on way or another) then I will spend whatever little money I have on a rope and just hang myself.My mental health is getting worse. It's clouding my judgement and barring me from making any decisions and it's even barring me from talking to anyone. I think I should have just committed suicide at 15 years old when I thought about it a lot. Now I grew up and I made my life worse. "
"Preparing for death, letting things go.","I used to work with Hospice patients, and we would do training to try to understand what they were going through.  As they began to accept that they were going to die, they would slowly let go of things that had once been important to them.  Despite still trying for quite some time, this has been slowly happening with me for the past year.  I don't think I really realized it until today when I felt an utter disconnect to the second most important thing in the world to me.  Now I just have one last thing to let go of.  Not trying to get people to panic and attempt to ""save me.""  As if they could... Just feels good to be real somewhere.  To share what's going on.  To wonder if it will make someone else feel less alone... perhaps just me.  "
So Much Built Up,"I don't know where to start. I went to my doctor today for a follow-up from an appointment a week ago. These appointments have nothing to do with depression or suicide, but the nurse asks questions about it because I have a history. Twice last year I was out on disability from work while I went through outpatient therapy.But when I answered the questions and openly admitted to my current mental state being very shaky, it was never brought up again. No follow-up from the doctor at all. Makes me feel like it really doesn't matter.I lost my job in June that I had for 10 years. I was blindsided, and I was betrayed. I have a lot of anger still festering about how things were handled. I was unemployed for a month and a half before a temp agency found me a job. It was a job below my level of expertise, but I was gratefulfor it. 4 days in my dad goes to the hospital for an unknown illness, three weeks later he died of lung cancer. This leads to two things. 1) I am missing a ton of time from my new job while my dad is in the hospital and then eventually on hospice at home. 2) My dad died, and I'm his power of attorney/personal representative. So at first I'm dealing with medical decisions, and then he died and I am dealing with the estate while trying to get a normal work schedule back.(Did I mention none of my ex-co-workers from as little as 2 months ago reached out to send condolences? Fuck them, right?)It doesn't work out though, and they let me go at the end of the temp period. So I'm jobless again. Here's the thing, they started scheduling interviews for my job while I was working it and telling me that they didn't know anything about the end of my contract. Just treated me like an idiot.The whole time this is going on I am losing 80 pounds without trying. I had digestive issues that started before my first job loss and we are still figuring it out.And I'm type 2 diabetic now.It's been a shit summer, going into a shit fall, in depressed, I'm angry, I'm anxious, I'm overwhelmed, and I'm just needing it to end some way our another.That's my story."
"Everything is so much work, I just want to give up��_","My mind is having a panic right now and I'm having so much trouble putting everything together. I don't think I want to kill myself but I do want my life to end. Everyday is so much work and stress and I never get a break. I just want to throw everything out the balcony and engage in self-destructive behaviour. I'm usually pretty good at describing how I feel with very specific neologisms but moments like these I can't describe.I'm all over the place and I'm sorry if this sounds like it's disjointed rant. I'm hoping that expressing myself will help me internalize my thoughts better and put everything in place.My unreliable memory is one of my biggest daily struggles. I often forget important details or remember things that never happened. I'm very aware of this and basically have had to hack my way around this. Everything goes in a to-do list, even my daily meals. I can even forget to eat so that in itself is a fucking project. At work, I keep a very detailed journal of what I did during the day because I won't be able to tell my boss what I did when I get held accountable for something. I can remember facts very well but never ask me if something happened, I assume whatever's in my mind is false. It causes me so much anguish that I can't trust myself. I can't rely on my memory and it frustrates me so much.Even more frustrating is my mood. My default mood is dysthymic; slightly sad but not in despair. However, my mood is like the weather, constantly changing and very unpredictable. I can go from optimistic to extreme melancholia in 2.8 seconds. My feelings rarely match the situation and I can't use them to make decisions. I never know when it's about to happen. Sometimes, it's completely random. Other times, I get triggered (not the same at the 'triggered' meme) by something in the environment, usually something stupid like a certain sound or whatever my mind decides to be unpleasant during that situation. These episodes can last from a few minutes to a few days, I never know. I basically have to design my life around the mood swings. For example, during certain phases it's too dangerous for me to drive. I find myself in despair when I'm always worried that my mood will turn for the worst at any moment. I can be having an OK time and the next thing I know I'll be grounded to the floor sobbing, for no reason of course.Hallucinating on a regular basis doesn't help either. I hear and see things almost all the time. I've somehow trained myself to differentiate between reality and my hallucinations but it's still really terrifying. Sometimes it's mundane, like music in the distance. Other times, it's strange insects and animals crawling up my wall at 3 am at night. I even get phantom feelings like being pulled out of the bed when no one is there. I have to live with all of these distractions and still get on with my life. I lament the fact that I'll never be able to watch a sunset in peace and quiet.There's so much more I could talk about; this is but a glimpse of what a nightmare my mind is. I always have to be on top of my illness and it's so draining. Yet, being an adult, I have so many responsibilities leaving me with little time for rest. Work, paying bills, side projects, maintaining the house, buying groceries, visiting friends, and so on. I want to do so much more in my life and have a fulfilling one at that. Instead, everything is a chore because my mind refuses to work normally. Hell, even 'fun' things have to go on my to-do list because I'll actually forget to enjoy myself. Everyone speaks of the daily grind but I got two of them: one inside my head and one outside. I have so much to keep up with that very often I break down and burn out. I wish my life was simple, easy to maintain and smooth, but instead it's so cluttered with my mind's nonsense I just can't do it anymore.I get help regularly. My psychiatrist who's way past retirement age still sees me every two weeks since 5 years because I'm an interesting and difficult case for him. He says I've got 'a bit of everything' but my unofficial diagnosis is bipolar schizoaffective disorder. It was a nightmare with so much trial and error with all sorts of therapies. My medication, a cocktail of about 20 pills a day, has gotten me to a point where I can 'function' day-to-day though it doesn't mean my symptoms have disappeared. Of course, I've been the hospital many times and seen tons of therapists and even 'spiritual healers' but to no avail.I often find myself desperate for happiness. I try everything whether it's a new life philosophy, a new gadget, an outing��_ Nothing really seems to do it. I end up with existential angst when it ends up feeling all meaningless. It's so hard to convince myself to keep going when even a fulfilling and productive day can still result in me rolling on the floor crying my eyes out at night because the wrong thought appeared in my head.My support circle is pretty big and everyone who cares about me knows about my illness. My fiance tries her hardest to support me but I can see the caretaker fatigue in her eyes. It's the worst for them because there's no way to talk me out of my symptoms. I can't just stop hallucinating on command. I try to explain that it's just my neurotransmitters going crazy but I know if I saw someone sobbing on the floor I'd try very hard to make them feel better even if it's not possible.I don't know how I feel right now. All I know though, is I want it to stop��_"
Feeling overwhelmed and wanting to die,"I tried to kill mused today. All I wanted was my boyfriend to help me somehow since he sees me on this depression spiral but all he says is ""it will get better"" I know it will but currently I feel trapped in my own home, I have no friends, and I constantly feel weak or unmotivated. I have no desire to have sex with my partner and tend to find the worst in him lately. I love him but some things he does amplifies my depression. I don't want to die but when I get hurt, lonely, or overwhelmed the one thought I can't shake is killing myself. I don't know what to do.  I'm afraid I'll lose control and act on impulse and actually kill myself soon. I work from home and the only time I leave my house is to take my dog out. I'm also only 18 and I feel like this is too much for me. Somebody please help me somehow. Thanks. "
Dignitas in Switzerland,"I have been reading about a group called Dignitas in Switzerland. They provide assisted-suicide via drugs that the ""member"" (you have to become a member) administers themselves. Anyone have any insight on Americans travelling there for this purpose? Apparently they have helped many British and German citizens pass peacefully. "
I need someone to tell me everything is going to be ok,"I don't know what to believe anymore. I'm a weird, antisocial, lonely 17 year old. I've never had a girlfriend (never will) and can't even talk to girls. I honestly never have had a friend before. Everyday I think about killing myself to the point where I feel it's destined to be. I have no social skills and fear any type of social interaction.
I purposely starve myself for days just to try and feel better. That makes it even worse because when I do this my dad worries his self sick over me and I am too stupid to realize that. Everyday he asks me if I'm doing ok and I tell I'm I am when Im really not. I started to begin cutting myself again and it's only been getting worse. The only time I leave my room is when I have to go to school because I am certain everybody would be better off without having to see me.
I have always been quiet since I was a kid and it's like people treat you like your not human. They always question why your so quiet and sometimes they don't even recognize that your there. People truly don't like me but they just pretend that do. This has been going on for years and I can't take anymore because all I do is hurt others when I try to do good. I don't tell people how I feel because I'm pretty sure nobody cares about me.
Even writing this brings me anxiety because I know I have to interact with people... I just wish I could cry myself to sleep and never wake up.  No one would every truly miss me..."
Overdose/Suicide Attempt,I want to overdose on Advil and Benadryl and just end this. I have enough to do the job. I'm really tired of this shit. I just want to give up.
Transgirl thinking about killing herself,"I honestly don't know where to turn to or what to expect and I was hoping this was my best shot so here goes:I am a 20 year old transgirl who has been on hormones for about 4 months. Recently I suffered from a depressive episode due to gender dysphoria until about a couple weeks ago. I just got a job and I was presenting myself as female and using a female name. The only problem is that I still look somewhat masculine so I get stared at constantly and dismissed. I cannot connect with any of my coworkers because I look and act strange to them.I know I'm supposed to wait on these hormones but I'm really scared. What if they don't work, what if I'll get beaten up, what if I'll lose my job due to just being me? I want to be happy but it's so hard. It's gotten to the point where all I do is just think about death and  hope maybe I'll get a do-over. I just can't take any of this anymore."
School is giving me suicidal thoughts,"School is the worst. I get so nervous and worked up about it that I throw up or pass out. I will force myself to pass out by hyperventilating just to get a break from it all. I don't know what to do and I'm starting to get suicidal thoughts. My mom only shames me for procrastinating too much or ""poor me shit."" Please help!"
"I keep repeating to myself, ""kill yourself, kill yourself, do it already"" Im ready to listen to my inner thoughts.","Ive attempted in the past, but at the last moment either i live through it, just in a hellblaze of pain, becoming a even bigger failure, or my body stops me. My mind screams to do it, but sometimes, my body just stops me.Sometimes my body will give up on life and ill lay there, wanting to shed a tear, yet i know no one will care, so i lay quietly, in the darkness for days on end. I try to drown out the voices with all i have left, music.
But recently, i dont care to listen to all i have. To do what has stuck with me for all my life. Im ready to listen to the voices. Im ready to listen to my inner shouts. If only i had easier access to guns, my life would be so much harder, but i dont. Instead, i have to go out in either a more painfull way.I hope others continue to have the will to carry on, but sadly, i think i lost mine. "
The only reason i havent...,"Killed myself is because I am terrified of it just being worse or being stuck as a ghost or some crap like that, however much I want to live (and I really do) I simply cannot stand the pain of the reality I am in or the way people treat me.I'm not really looking for sympathy or pity or any don't do it crap but feel free to say whatever you want if you replyI guess I just wanted to share that that is the only thing that has stopped me for like 12 years now... Maybe someone else feels the same way or has something to say about it?"
Feeling sorry for yourself,"Some days I feel deeply depressed. I'm a highly sensitive person diagnosed with bipolar depression. It must be annoying dealing with me because who wants to be with someone who always walk around eggshells or simply can't get over things quickly. I've been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder too.
There was a point I was afraid going on planes, car rides, etc because I feared an accident.
I take criticism, disapproval, rejection very personally.
Sometimes I wish I could be free.
I took me this longest time to finally open myself up to having sex or letting a man touch me. I feel like that has ruined my relationship.
Or I perceived friends with benefits to be more than purely sex.
As I lie in my self pity and constant ruminating. I always feel angry or self righteous and bitter because there are people who are the exact opposite than me. They live their lives freely, carefree, etc. I'm not a more noble person because I'm highly sensitive.
I'm frustrated I cannot seem to see the big picture.
Why can't I love myself?
It annoys me that some smug asshole goes to sleep perfectly fine even though he hurts others. He lashes out at others, while I self destruct. I feel pathetic."
cheated on my gf drunk and now i wanna kill myself,"didnt know what i was doing, was shitfaced drunk an d now i am all alone with no gf and my friends hate me for cheating, i dont want to feel pain anymore :("
Buying a gun tomorrow since stores are closed.,"I'll spare you the details of my life since no one will give a shit anyway. I'm just done with everything. Nothing helps. Yes I'm well aware that I'm not alone. It doesn't make a shit of difference. Nothing can be done and I'm sick of wasting life/time/money/air. As much as I love the people in my life, they aren't worth living with this shit, nor are they of any help because they don't know what to do. I tried knives but I can't bring myself to draw blood. I don't have a garage to try CO poisoning with a car. I've never touched a gun in my life, but I've done it enough in video games so I should be able to figure it out right? Just one movement and it's done. Do it in the bathroom so it's easier to clean. I don't want help since it can't be helped. I just need a place to vent where no one's gonna try to stop me. Delete if you want, doesn't matter really."
I'm so tired.,i just want to sleep but I'm afraid of what i might dream of. i guess it's just my own fault. i guess that all of my problems are my own fault. I've heard that's supposed to make me feel better because it means i can work to get better and change things. it only makes me feel worse because i know i won't. people won't care if i die. i've asked some. at least then i could rest. i wouldn't be tired. i wouldn't be.
Normal?,I�۪m not sure if it�۪s normal to consider suicide on a normal basis. I�۪m an engineer for a larger corporation and lately I�۪ve been thinking what�۪s the point at ALL. Really I�۪m wondering is this a similar experience or should I ignore it? I�۪m not sure but either way it seems real dim in the future. Just more soul crushing hour filled weeks and heartless people.
help,"I really enjoy stuff like sim racing and football. But i also have depression, and I am taking medicine for it. So after I failed one of my test my parents took away everything (i am a junior in highschool) no TV no simracing no football nothing... now i don't even feel the need to do anything... i'm just going to end it, all my friends don't like me. And i try to discuss the situation with my parents but they end up screaming at me... i'm done with this world."
The only things stopping me are my responsibilities.,"It�۪s not for my loved ones, hope for the future, fear of death, fear of pain, or anything like that.There are things I have to accomplish for my families sake and this is my only motivation to not kill myself. Maybe that�۪s good enough, but what happens when that�۪s no longer the case?"
I've been thinking pretty heavily the past few days,"I was let go from a job I moved halfway across the country for on Friday. I was just offered a delivery driver position at Jimmy John's, which I will absolutely be taking, because I need money, I just didn't think it would end up this way.I'm almost 25. I should have some idea of what I want to do but I don't. I'm a failure. A loser. I'm a waste of life and I want it to be over. We can finally close this pathetic story. The only concern I have is debt. I can't leave my family with that."
I don�۪t think I can live with what he did to me.,I was sexually abused for years and I can�۪t take one more second of reliving the feeling of his hands all over my body. I would rather take my life than live with the guilt and shame that I feel over this. I can�۪t tell anyone what happened to me. I feel like I am going insane.
I need to put myself to rest,"I�۪ve crashed my motorcycle today. I don�۪t know how, but I�۪m mostly fine.It was the most beautiful moment of my life. I know it�۪s sick to think that, but it felt good to see people approach me to help me after the crash, the feeling of my body being dragged by my bike for several meters on the ground, looking at the sky while this one song played in my earphones.I�۪ve just felt emptiness for the past years.I don�۪t want this second chance. I want to get on my broken bike, bring it up to speed one last time and then just end it all.I�۪m going to therapy in 8 hours knowing that I�۪m going to lie to my therapist because otherwise I�۪m going to be forced into some facility.There�۪s one another person in my life that I could talk this out with, but this person has more important things to do now. It�۪s killing me and my selfishness is too.I just don�۪t want to drown anymore, please."
"Seem's Like Instead Of Me Hoping I'll Live Past 27, I'm Praying I'll Live Past 20","I have really all but given up right now. Each and every day I think about disappearing from the world more and more, as if it's becoming an actual option.
Heck it is.I know life is hard for everybody and everybody is going through there own things.
 Nothing is getting better to me, and it's hard to be happy with everyone when they talk about how things were hard for them and now the light is finally starting to shine through, cause I don't feel the same. Everytime I think I take a good step forward, Its 3 steps back.
School isn't hard, but life is, and life is affecting my school work.
I wanna do great and finish college, but that seems to be a fleeting dream.
I'm running low on cash, I wont' ask my parents because they already had to cover for me, and I feel guilty enough asking them for money.
Jobs not calling me back, even though I got the job, and I'm supposedly in the system.
No girl who understands me, or who I can talk to.
I don't wanna worry my friends because I'm sure they won't understand
Feels like i'm just existing. Every bodies worried about what's going on in the world, and I'm just worried if I'll make it past my birthday next year.
I haven't thought about what I would do, I just know I'm thinking that after my deceased grandmothers birthday I'm out of here."
Ugly,"im not good at pretending that im ok,
so i look like shit.i dont smile, i still have acne (im 19), i have black circles under my eyes and i have a very pale skin ( cuz i never leave my house, only when i go to school)
so people stare at me every day.
some of them point at me and they just laugh.
some of them give me that disguated look.
and some of them just tell me that im ugly or that i look like a fucking methhead.im so fucking depressed (for many other reasons, but i think this is the worst one)
i also have social anxiety so i dont have any friends and i never had a gf.
when i try to talk to someone i just turn red and its so embarrassing.
i have already attempted suicide last month and i still feel like terrible.does anyone have the same or similar problem?
i dont know what to do anymore, everyone is so fucking rude."
Im done,My last post was how I'm tired of living and the only good thing left in my life was my girlfriend but she just broke up with me and I feel so alone and hopeless. I don't really feel like going on. I really want to kill myself
Thinking about killing myself,I got raped at 10 years old by a drunk homeless man and who is trying to find where I live and i am now 19 year old boy with no friends my gf dumped me everyone hates me my mom and dad hate me  i got abused when i was kid i don't have  any reason to live anymore i want to kill myself
Generic shit,"Whats the fucking point of life if you are literally incapable of achieving happiness? Like fuck dude, im drunk and i feel even shittier than sober...i give myself one week, and if i still feel like complete fucking shit like i have been for the past few years, thats it, im done"
Feeling like a prisoner in my own life,"I basically just feel like i'm prisoner, I can't imagine a futur for myself, my days are the same and i'm feeling forced to do what im doing.After being bullied a lot durng school, I stopped it and stood at home for multiple years, playing online video games and making friends on it, it helped me escaping real life and the thoughts of killing myself.
Years later, 21, i havent done anything with my life, lot of shit happened making it even worse, i didnt really go outside through these years, i have no friends around my city, all are eirher from different countries or at the opposite side of it.I recently got a small job on internet that gives me 700$/month, it helps me making my mind busy so i dont think a lot, but i dont di anything beside this, listening to music (linkin park hello), i even almost dont play video games anymore when i used to do it  lot every day for years.I feel like my futur is pointless, i dont feel the courage to do anything like going outside, the main reason being that i have nobody to hang out with, i cant find any positive point in my life, i dont feel like i can enjoy anything, even when il trying to, i fail. I feel like i cant get a normal life again, feel like i'm ugly and mainly worthless.I never achieved anything good in my life and never made anyone proud, each day feel like being in jail, i just feel forced to keep on breathing, i recently was in a long distance relationship, during these 2 months my depressive thoughts were gone, i felt happy, the reason i got my actual job is bcs i wanted money to visit the girl, but it didnt happen because she ended it before, which gave me the depression back with an even bigger pain.If i dont keep myself busy i just overthink, think avout death and try to tbink about a way to kms without pain.Id like to be happy but i feel like whatever i do isnt enough, and when i manage to feel happy, something quickly happens to break it all I just feel like i dont have any strenght left to get up, go outside on a regular basis or finding anything that makes me happy, im just totaly dead inside and fake to be happy"
What's the point of anything?,"I feel like I have just a very different view on life. I don't really value it but I also don't really care if I live to be 100 either. It's funny that you're just thrown into existence with no say and forced to just integrate into how the world works just because. You have to get a job, go to school, do this, do that, but why? I didn't choose to be a part of it and I find a lot of things that I ""have to do"" to be extremely unpleasant. So much of your life is dictated by other people. Dumb rules that exist because some idiot 50 years ago did something and now everyone is inconvenienced. Extra security at airports and other places now because some fuck decided that it'd be a great idea to fly a plane into a building or some shit because of some dude in the sky that there's no proof of. Requirements that you're forced to meet in order to graduate college. Oh you'd like to be a computer engineer? Great take all these English classes, humanities, and social sciences fuck all that math and science shit. This Eskimo that was preserved in ice and studied by archaeologists will help you a great deal when you're designing a cpu or developing a program. I think about dying a lot to be quite honest. I don't know if I'd ever go through with it but I think about jumping off a building frequently. I mean yeah I'd make some people upset but is that something that matters? At that point I'm letting the feelings of others determine a major decision in my life but the only one that should have any influence on me and what I do is myself."
"I dont feel right, like im not a normal person","I came here because I feel like this is the only place that I can  talk to someone about this. I started dating this cashier at a store down the road from my house and fell in love with her, everything about her just seemed perfect and she told me she felt the same but about a month in she told me that she didn't feel ready for a relationship, like she couldn't put in the effort she felt that I deserved because she was dealing with alot at work and at home. She told me that she still loved me and still wanted to spend time with me when she could but didn't want a relationship until she felt her life was more stable but a month after we broke up she started dating this other guy and cut me off. This was around june-july when this happened and I'm still upset, I still think about it every day and I just don't feel like I should be this upset. A normal person wouldn't be this hurt over  a girl they only knew for a month or 2. And the fact that I am just makes me feel like I'm not meant to be here, like im not meant to find love and have a family  because I don't know how to just let go. I used to have goals and things that I looked forward to but every day that passes I feel worse and worse and I just want it to end already."
Is it okay to tell my suicidal friend this?,"Will it help in any way for me to tell her that if she dies, I know for sure I'll kill myself too? I'm not fabricating any part of that. Some days I feel like I'm barely hanging on and losing her would make me go off the edge. I'm so sad for her and I wish I could help but she's been struggling with these issues for so long and I just want her to be happy again. "
I think I have it figured out,"This is the third time in the last couple days I've tried writing here, each time I delete it after a while before posting.I am a 26yr old guy, work 6 days a week at a local blacksmith shop in rural Australia. The last person I spoke to that was not related to work was in February according to the call log on my phone and probably around the same time in person too. I tried finding joy in a game as I would have before but can't find it. Everything feels the same and I cant see a way out.I'm going camping this weekend(alone) and for the first time will be carrying out supplies to not come back. "
Suicide is the only answer to all the shit I've done.,"Hey guys. I recently got exposed as a catfish online and it was true, I faked my identity. I lied to so many people, even got into two relationships. What started as boredom, turned to curiosity, then obsession. I loved the new identity I made for myself; I had wanted to escape my own. I tend to have such negative, unhealthy thoughts. Suicide crosses my mind daily because of the constant guilt. Everytime I would push myself to tell the truth, my heart would feel as though it would drop into my stomach. I don't think anyone could forgive me. I know I sound like a whiner, I know I need to move on and focus on reality, but this has got me really down. I just feel so sorry for all that I had hurt because of my want to feel like I belonged somewhere in the world."
"Too Much Disappointment, Too Much Unaccomplished, Too Much Failure","I tried to get through this day, but I just can't let this go.
I put out this some time ago, but I couldn't follow any of this. I'm too messed up.I even made this, but that didn't help either. I tried everything to get better, but it's no use. No matter how I try, I always ended up failing and not getting the way I wanted it. What's the point of all of this? What's the point of trying? Moreover, what's the point of living? There's nothing good or great or decent happening to me.I might as well kill myself and end it all, and be done with it."
"A casual friend of mine attempted suicide recently and doesn't know I know about it - I want to send her an encouraging message, can anyone give their opinions?","So this person isn't a close friend - I worked with her for a month or so and got on very well actually - she's a really sweet, awesome kind of person to talk to. We've peripherally kept in touch here and there over the years, but not to more than 2-3 times a year. I was completely unaware of what I assume is her serious depression.A few weeks back, she jumped off a 5 story building and survived.The story that her family has put out there is that it was a hit and run - I don't want to debate what they should have said btw, but this is the situation.I don't mind hinting that I know and I'm here to talk with her if she needs, but I don't just want to drop the bomb that I know tactlessly. Here's what I've sketched out so far:Hey mate, so sorry to hear you've been going through so much!I truly hope you continue down the path of improving and getting all the help you need. You're awesome and I'm glad you're still around :)I'd like to invite you to a board games night with the Mrs and some of our other friends whenever you're feeling up to it.I'm sorry to say it takes me hearing such terrible news to remind me you're awesome and I'd like to catch up with you.Wishing you all the good feelings in the world and don't hesitate to get in touch if you need to talk to someoneWhat do we reckon? Light enough?EDIT: before someone suggests it, I'm aware going to see someone is the best way generally, but it is not applicable in this case - I'm not close enough with her for that and I certainly don't want to intrude on her privacy by tracking her down seeing as I don't know which hospital she is even in - she has family and her partner with her, so she certainly isn't alone."
I don't care about anything anymore,"I feel so worthless and empty. I'm a highschool dropout and I don't do anything, I just sit in bed all day and waste away, distracting myself with stuff that always ends up reminding me how shit my existence is. Can't be bothered to do anything, even basic tasks. I'm a disappointment to everyone and I've got no future ahead of me. I've got nothing left. I'm fat and pathetically ugly to the point where I can't even leave the house. Every night I go to bed, I just hope that I won't wake up the next morning, or any mornings to come. I want to end it but I don't know how the fuck to do it, I need a method. Something effective, quick and not too painful. I need an escape. Please, tell me how I can escape this fucking life... "
A fucking day after my birthday and she's in a relationship with someone else,"I feel so broken. Tomorrow is my last fucking day, I can't take this anymore. This is so hard. Why me?"
Done,"These last few days before I kill myself, my mood has lightened.  I will no longer have to deal with this shit stained worthless, festering pile of pus world.  I love the fact that no one can stop me.  And I love the people who treat you like shit while crying about suicide. ""Here, let me act like a total fucking worthless piece of shit cunt toward you, for no good reason (you simply don't fit my objective standard, but don't objectify me, of course.  That's sexist after all.), but, oh my god, you want to leave earth?  You ungrateful, selfish asshole!  Now I have to judge you yet again in light of the fact that I'm an arrogant, entitled cunt!  I have to think about how I treat people!  Don' t you know I'm a woman and that's tantamount to abuse?""  I love that fact.  And I will make sure those who need to know get a note as to why I did it and how fucking worthless they are.
And to the psychologists, particularly those of you asswipes who believe in social justice - go fuck yourselves and your latently sexist advice.  Your worldview PERMITS and ENCOURAGES these worthless gaping syphilitic whore beasts.  You not only excuse them, you pretend that whatever is going on in the world is in fact the product of the person complaining.  It can't possibly be because the narcissistic female ego is entirely incapable of true self examination and change.  No sir.  It's those bad men.  Why?  Because everybody is a sheep's fucking worthless asshole waiting in line to either eat out or fuck a pussy, and  you are the diarrhea that comes out of that asshole.  Please, do analyze what I'm writing here, write it down, fold it up, wipe your worthless asshole with it, and then eat it.  That's what it is worth.  Now analyze that, repeat, eat, analyze, repeat, eat....you know, like the social sciences taught you.
Women are pieces of shit.  They are arrogant, complaining, narcissistic worthless pieces of shit.  I hope they and all of you are either raped or killed.  I delight in the idea that women killed in mass are arrogant, entitled American women.  As I go to my grave, I pray that god sends a million rapists to the earth to fucking rip this nation and its worthless vagina scum apart.  My sincere hope is that all women go about their business, get raped, and complain so I can LAUGH at them from the afterlife."
The death of a failure.,"I'm an absolute fucking failure, and I haven't even left secondary school. Well, sixth form specifically. But I just want to fucking die. Everyone loves to laugh at me, for every tiny thing I've ever said, every time I stutter and stumble over my words. They laugh, because my ex came out as a lesbian, mere days after she left me, mere days after my Nana was cremated. My best friends, who've stood by me for 5 years have just gotten up, and left me behind whilst they have the time of their lives at tresham. I'm forever being compared to everyone, the same everyone that confuses me with my perverted cuntsack of a brother. The same brother who goes from trying to kill me, to supposedly loving me in seconds. My parents have just given up on the failure I am. Hell, even the school fucking counselors have given up on me. I just want it to end and there's nothing else I want more than to just tie my school tie, the same one that everyone signed on the last day of year 11, so tight that it strangles me. Wouldn't that make things so much fucking better? No one would have to bother laughing at the biggest fucking failure this shit stain of a town has ever seen, or tolerating me stuttering and stumbling. Hell, even the school itself hates me: all the teachers know that everyone hates me, yet it took one guy nearly breaking open my cast whilst he beat the shit out of me, under a security camera, for them to even contemplate doing anything about it."
Is it bad to always be planning?,"I guess this doesn't really apply to this subreddit, but I constantly plan, write notes, and think about my own suicide. I don't know if that's a sign that I'll ever do anything again or if it's just some bizarre coping mechanism. I just always keep plans in mind. I've distanced myself from everyone, deleted all social media, and started to get rid of my belongings but I don't even see that as a warning sign because I have so little energy to go through with it. I guess this is just a rambling complaint. It's a year from the last time I planned a serious attempt and I guess I don't know if this is another one. "
im helpless,I cant do this life thing anymore. Im sick of everyone's shit. Nobody cares at this point. Everyone calls me a fat whore and is telling my boyfriend that he can do better. Everyone is leaving and i get told to die everyday. Im sick of getting abused by my friends mentally and sick of the karma physically.
Im worthless,"Im a worthless piece of shit and waste of space. I cant do anything right. Im not smart, pretty or inteligent. Im just a pathetic fuckup. "
Can someone tell me why I shouldn't do it?,"I don't know what options I have. I became codependent on a woman diagnosed with BPD, we had an on again off again relationship with for 7 years. I changed my whole life for the better to be with her after I met her. I cleaned my act up, got sober, found a job I love. Now that she left me in May of this year I've been a total mess. Lost my job, relapsed hard on alcohol, have no money. I've been seeing a therapist who knows my ex personally, and she has helped me understand things but once I leave the office it doesn't help. I've been on medication now for a while, I feel like the process of getting better mentally is exactly what my ex tried to get me to do for our whole relationship. I blame myself for everything that happened, and the clearer my mind is the more I dwell on the things I could have done differently if I felt better earlier.  I do have a new girlfriend but I can't stop comparing her to my ex and its making me have second thoughts constantly. I just want her back but I know that will never happen. I've been split black by her and she has a new boyfriend who I can't help but feel is way better than me. To make matters worse I'm 28 now, shes 27 and I've known her since I was 10-11 years old. We don't live in a big city and literally every street and every store I see or have to go to reminds me of her. It's impossible to get away from feeling like a huge chunk of my life is gone forever. Half of me wants to be the best person I can be, but that would only be for spite. The other half of me wants to end it all asap."
so much pain for someone so young,"i�۪m 20 and last night i almost attempted suicide, i ended up just self harming, but way more hardcore than usual. i have been depressed for like 5 years but it�۪s gotten worse as i got into college and started questioning myself about what i want to do in life... i had never planned to be alive for so long. long story short, i�۪ve been in a course i hate for two years (i chose it bc i thought i�۪d like but i found out i was wrong lol) and now i finally decided to change but while i wait for the test to be resettled i�۪m in a numbness limbo like i had never been before.
to make it worse, when i finally got reciprocated romantically for the first time in my life and it felt like nothing i had ever felt before and i was literally walking on air... the guy dumped me after 3 days of being together. and nothing had gone wrong, he just.. he has his personal mental illnesses as well. but i just can�۪t bring myself to let go of him, he still likes me, i know because he said so when he dumped me (lol). and i just.... it�۪s been a really deep and bad shock, this overdose of serotonin for 3 days and then getting so harshly pulled down to the bottom, i got deeper than i had ever been.
i feel physically sick, like i�۪m constantly about to pass out."

Children of suicide parents,"Will you ever get over the news  that one of your parents committed suicide? I�۪ve  thought about  it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more I read I see even those in their 20�۪s - 30�۪s struggle with a parent�۪s suicide.  Now Son is almost twenty, but still think it�۪s not the right time... maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident (car,etc). But I feel that would leave out a lot I would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death. I would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find me.I was on antidepressants for a couple years. Discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to  side effects with erection, and I noticed I would be crying more often, so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that I am thinking of suicide. "
"My ex roommate just used me in a scam, then threatened to kill me and tried to break down my door. I pissed myself.","So I moved into this place in August out of a homeless shelter and there was a guy living here named ""Peter"". Within a couple days my landlord was changing the locks and telling him to get his stuff out due to unpaid rent. I didn't know what was going on but I didn't care. I saw him a couple times later when he came to get his stuff.Yesterday I got woken up by my new roommate because someone was at the door. Was Peter. Asked me to do something for him and said it wasn't illegal but there would be $50 in it for me. I don't have my medication and I could really use that so I said sure. He said he'd call me later. Sure enough a couple hours later he calls and says frank will be here. Just say that you'll have the receipt to Peter and he'll give it to him. Frank comes and talks to me and then says a lot of stuff I wasn't expecting.He was his friend and trying to make sure he wasn't going to be homeless, winter is coming and it'll be cold and he always sees Peter outside his bar in the morning. He's got two kids to take care of and he doesn't want to have to take care of his friend but he's his friend and doesn't want him homeless. Gives me his number and $750 for what I then start to clue in about. That it's for rent and that Peter says he's still living here. That he wants me to take the $750 and give it to Peter so he can drink or do whatever with. That I'll be getting $50 from someone who clearly cares about his friends when I don't even have a fucking family. I was sick to my stomach.I took the money.I didn't know what to do. I took the money and his number and just said crap on autopilot. I was just... Stunned. Part of me desperately wants the money for my anti anxiety meds. Part of me wants to punch Peter. Part of me wants to throw up. But I just coast.I go back inside and I sit down and start playing GTA V. Was on pause. I didn't know what to do or how to process. I needed a minute.Peter calls.Asks what Frank said, if I got the money. I say yeah and he asks what Frank said again and I said he said a bunch of stuff but it didn't matter. Peter asked for specifics and I said stuff like outside his bar in the morning and he cares but I don't care. It's whatever. He says okay and he'll be there soon.The money was in a wad in my pocket. I took it out and saw the $50 from Frank. I took a $20 and put it on the side. Part of me was saying to tell Peter that I took extra because he got me in this shit and if he has a problem I'll just tell Frank myself. Part of me wanted to just take it and not mention it because one $20 missing would be nothing in the moment. Then everything started to sort of come back online. I realized how fucking disgusting this was. I was thinking of myself because I've never had friends or family who seriously cared in the past few years. And then he had someone who cares enough to pay rent for them and he's abusing it and using me to scam them. I started to spiral out into a panic attack and called Frank and told him Peter lied and to come get the money. Took the $20 on the side and put it back in the wad and sat down outside hyperventilating.Frank pulls up within a minute. He's yelling at someone on the phone. Telling him to pull his pants up and get his life together. He gets out and is smiley. I apologize and say I'm sorry try to explain why I went along with it but just kept saying sorry. He said thanks and don't worry about it. That he told Peter he talked to the landlord. I didn't have a choice. So when Peter immediately called me, within 3 minutes of ending the call with Frank I picked it up and said hello. He said why did you tell me you had the money when you didn't? I said he came back yelling at me saying that he talked to the landlord and I gave him the money back and didn't know what to do.He sighed and said ""Alright then.""That's it. Just a disappointed tone and resignation that he wasn't getting his money.Panic attack kept going for a while. Thought it was over.I'm sitting outside because it's nice today. He comes storming up the driveway screaming at me. Saying he knows I lied and he's going to fucking kill me. I run inside and slam the door and lock it. He takes out a key and tries to unlock it and suddenly I am super glad the landlord changed the locks. I call Frank and he shows up faster than the cops could. Starts screaming at him outside. I call the police and they arrest Peter. Frank drives home crying. I sit inside with piss on the inside of my pants crying in the bathtub.I am barely keeping shit together and having a hard time coming up with a reason why I should keep bothering."
people to talk to,"please let me know if there are kind people out there. I just need an ear to talk to, nothing else required."
A draft of my suicide note.,"Someone please talk to me before I do it.""I�۪m really sorry it had to end this way. The truth is that I�۪ve always felt out of place in this world. Places of comfort are hard for me to come by and certain human emotions remain inaccessible to me. I feel, and have always felt, so alone here.In a room full of people, even those who I love dearly, my reality seems to be from the vantage point of an outside observer, as if I�۪m in the midst of a movie but as an invisible spectator. I watch life happen from the outside in, never actually living it. It�۪s hard for me to relate to others but do a good job at looking like I do. It�۪s even harder to find people who can relate to me but do a good job at acting like they do.I have no real identity. I belong to no labels and no label can claim me. Many who have met me have told me this: ���You�۪re different�۝. While contemporary culture places value on uniqueness and self-branding, my being unique and different has given me a lifetime of uncertainty as to who I am, where I am going, and what I want. I�۪ve experimented with these questions time and again over the years. I�۪ve failed every single time. The result of all my inquiry is nothing. I am nothing but a passing breeze in everyone�۪s hair. I have no impact. I do nothing. I want nothing. I am nothing.Whatever I have been through, however trivial or substantial they may be to different people, is inconsequential to the stupidity of this existential crisis that I can�۪t seem to escape. Don�۪t feel bad about this, don�۪t question what you could have done to save my life. Scoff at my weakness, my lack of self-discipline, and how I took myself too seriously. I�۪m aware of all of these traits and I know they�۪ve made me hard to be around, hard to love. I, too, have struggled to be around myself, and have spent most of my life escaping my own self.The one thing I can say with certainty is that I love my family more than anything. They know me more than anyone else could and accept the real me more than anyone else ever has or ever could. Mom, Dad, Ash, Ate, Kuya ��� you are all angels in your own right. I�۪m very, very lucky to have been born into this family. I�۪ve done very little in my life to express my endless gratitude for all of you. Please continue to hug the kids for Auntie Lex, and teach them to be strong in the face of life�۪s bullshit ���  a lesson I cannot teach myself, but only embody in my own fate. I love all of you more than you can imagine.I wish I could go on living. But life was meant for the living, and I�۪ve been dying inside for a long time. Life, lived properly, lived as you all have lived it, looks so sweet. I�۪ve never felt worthy of that experience. I may not be the judge of this, but then again, who is? There is no real answer to that. So I may as well judge it for myself.I�۪m so sorry you have to deal with this. I don�۪t want you to deal with this anymore.Love you forever,
Pooh"""
Has anyone else ever dealt with this?,"I don't know why, but I seem to be incapable of making lasting friendships. Everybody turns against me one way or another. And I can't figure out if I'm just a bad judge of character, so I bring shitty people into my life, or if I'm a shitty person, and people leave because of that. I tried killing myself during a particularly bad breakup with a friend, and she told me I was just trying to manipulate her into staying. Has anyone else ever been accused of being manipulative in your suicidal thoughts? I Googled it, and literally all I could find was ""How to tell if your friend is manipulating you"". There's not much sympathy out there for people who are accused of manipulative behavior. It's lonely."
I wanna die with a blunt on my lips.,"I wanna die with a blunt on my lips, a gun to my head and some blood on my wrists... I don't own a gun so imma just smoke a blunt then jump off a bridge. Fly high, land hard, die high... Not sure when though I just don't think I've got lots of time left though... I don't know anymore...I always think back to when I was 14 and first tried to kill myself and sometimes I'm like I was so stupid for that and times like these I wish I already did it and didn't have to suffer like this over and over, this shit never goes away it just eats at me everytime my brain isn't distracted with something else, I fucking hate myself and I wish I was dead."
Dirty bottomfeeder tweaker,"I've been looking into all sorts of shit tonight that's fucked up my worldview. Long story short I've concluded that my status, as a low status male is causing me a lot of pain. I have no friends, people don't respect me, and my only friend is my girlfriend of 6 years as a 20 year old. I lost a prestigous job because I couldn't fit and now I work at a golf course. I have very little social skills and Im falling into meth addiction. I'm so fucking lost and I have no idea what to do now. I feel like my only options are to kill myself or join the armyThe last time I binged I overdosed twice pretty hard last week, I might do it harder this time, I got double the supply and I want to scorch the fuck out of everything I everknew"
I'm tired of fighting,"I'm not sure how to start so bare with me. I am feeling so depressed right now and suicidal, I want to run away and never look back or I just want to go buy some pills and end it or I just want to keep burning myself. I want to end it but the thing that's holding me back is my son but maybe my mom can just take care of him. I just want my pain to stop and I want to call my doctor to get some meds to feel better but I don't want to try the meds and just feel the exact same way. I hate my job. I'm a cna, most nights I'd rather just let all of my patients just lay in their own bodily fluids, most nights I just don't give two shits if I hurt them. Then I feel bad because I hurt them so then I feel like shit cause I hurt them. I don't hit them or anything like that I just get a tad rough when I roll them.I'm aware I'm a terrible person, I should probably quit actually I know I need to I can't cause I need money. I'm trying to get hired as a phlebotomist but most place don't want me cause I'm fresh outta school so that's awesome. All of it just makes me think what is the point in trying anymore? Seriously. I just want it all to go away. My bf tells me try to find happiness where we are at but honestly I just can't. I'm trying but I can't. I just want to give up I can't do this anymore, I've been depressed since I was 14 I'm 21 now. I'm just so tired of fighting the same damn fight. I can't do it anymore."
My problem: I can't go,"I've been struggling with depression since junior high. At 40, I understood a lot about how this came to happen. And I am so done with being alive. I am not sad anymore, not angry, not afraid. But I have a big, painful problem. I am a father. This makes it worse. A living hell. Literally, for me. The only reason I am alive at the moment is the fear of hurting my kids. An irrational fear, because they have a good mom and life insurance can most likely help. But I have something in the back of my head that tells me that my death would be a loss of experience and protection to them. On the other hand, I feel that I have no control over the universe and that me staying is pointless anyways. I want the best for them, but we are already living separated for 10 years now. They are used to not see me all the time. and sometimes not for a long time when I have to work odd shifts or second jobs, and I'm totally pissed and tired to be useful anyways. The most comfortable, logical thing to do for me is to just go. I have 0 problem with that. But I feel guilty as fuck that if I take that easy pill, my kids could be impacted. always having, at the last moment of planning, these thoughts that maybe, someday, one of them could be stuck in life and I am the one who can give any advice, to make their life be better. Even if they would have learned to hate me by that time. This is a really horrible and ridiculous situation and makes me feel even dumber. Condemned to be alive, like some kind of purgatory or living hell. I know that I will have to go sooner anyways, hopefully in my mid 50s. I just want to have enough assurance that my presence wont be necessary anymore. Because  is fucking hell and it hurts everywhere. Being alive..."
A failed attempt,"Almost 2 weeks ago, I tried to kill myself.  I was not successful.  This has affected me more than I ever believed it would.  It is so hard to recover from an attempt.  I wanted to die but I'm still here.  I want so much to not be here.  Please help me."
Raped at 12 and 13 years later still suicidal.,"The short story is that when I was 12 I was violently raped. I spent a lot of time in both hospital and then mental health clinics pretty much all my teenage life with small stages in between going to school and being a somewhat normal kid .My family were really supportive and being the youngest of 3 siblings I had a lot of love. However I've never been able to shake the feeling that I ruined their lives too when this whole thing happened. I've been living with this guilt that I turned my family's lives upside down forever. This didn't help when I turned to suicide as my only option at the age of 14. Between 14 and 21 I overdosed 6 times all failing evidently. I'm 25 now and objectively have a a good life. I'm Melbournian ( allegedly the most liveable city 7 years in a row - sorry for humble brag haha) I have a masters degree, I'm apparently attractive even though I feel l like a hideous monster. Middle class in a developed country. But I don't care about any of this stuff. I just want to die. Everyday I feel like the same 12 year old girl screaming and crying and feeling it's never going to end and I'm so much pain. It's like I can time travel and be in the exact moment, and I just can't bare the pain. What's more is that dating is absolute hell. Ive dated a bit. serious and non serious but anything that gets slightly serious they abandon me when the find out what happened. And don't get me wrong I get it's a big thing to deal with but these are guys that are like telling my they love me and stuff. I dunno I guess I shouldn't tell anyone. It's just hard when it's a part of your identity- I never got to be an adult or even an adolescent without this. I love my family too much to ruin their lives even more..but I feel I'm condemned to life as opposed to death. I really wish the man who did this to me just killed me when he had the chance. "
"I have a lot of invisible ""friends""",I know some of them are trying to get to know me better but I still feel so lonely. I keep getting told that they want to be closer to me by the school counselor but guess what? Everyday I'm alone in the canteen. Where did they go? I don't blame them though. I'm a loser who just hurts the people around me.Oh and online is the worst. You tell people how hard everything is and they give some superficial answer that they'll be your friend.
Please someone help me,"I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so desperate.
The love of my life is asleep in the next room but I've been sat on the sofa for what feels like hours just sobbing. I just want it all to end, just want to go to sleep next to him but never wake up, but I can't do that to him. I'm stuck here, and the pain is the most I've ever felt, I can barely breathe. I just want to be normal for him, but I'm not, I just want to die, but I can't. I need the pain to stop, I can't take it anymore I'm not strong enough"
"If I refuse to eat and drink, I'll assume someone will send me to the hospital. Can the hospital force me to eat/drink?",I guess the only thing they could do is hook me up to IVs. After I rip them out will they strap me to the bed?
I'm exhausted,"This is the first time I've ever been on this subreddit but I don't know where to go. I'm so done with life but I guess me posting here must mean there's some part of me that wants help. I'm a 19 y/o male with nothing going for me, I'm a high school dropout, I don't have a job and I live with my mom and stepdad. I can barely eat anymore because it makes me sick every bite. I don't enjoy anything whatsoever anymore. I used to work out often but I've lost all motivation for self improvement or anything really. My girlfriend is the only good part of my life and I feel as if she's getting close to leaving me because I'm such a mess. I've really got nothing going for me and I feel so alone after all of my friends moved away. And I don't want to wear people down with my problems. I would go see a therapist but I can't afford it anymore. I really see no point in moving on when I've got nothing going for me and I'm all alone."
Thought I'd live longer then this.,"I might kill myself soon, I'm so over life dude, I thought I was gonna get my shit together, get a job, pass school, I'm already popular, I've got lots of friends and I've had a boyfriend for over a year and but I managed to fuck up the school thing 4 weeks...I haven't been to school since September 22 (I've been on suspension it's complicated) I start back tomorrow and I'm NOT looking forward to it, I could keep looking for a job but honestly there's no point anymore, I'm probably gonna kill myself in mid December, if I try and fail it'll be the 4th time. I've wanted to die since I was around 8 I remember telling my mom I wished I was a rock because rocks aren't alive, I hope my boyfriend finds someone better then me when I'm gone, he's honestly the only thing keeping me around and he might kill himself soon after I do... I don't know if I'll stick to this plan or for find another reason to stick around longer but if I do kill myself I just hope no one misses me too much..."
I don't know if I belong here but I want someone to help me,"I wish I didn't have to worry. I want to know everything is going to be ok but it's not. It's not going to be ok because I'm a lazy poor excuse for a human being. I lost my job because I couldn't take my ass to work on time. Since then I've just been staying at home with my parents and it's ok. Everyone told me how I wouldn't be able to handle ""the real world"" when I was slacking off in high school (oh yeah I dropped out by the way) and now I understand. I'm not even ""out in the real world"" yet but now that I've experienced a little bit of it I want out. I want a way out of the real world where I don't have to worry about anything. I just want to . But I can't do that so the only way out is to take myself out. The funny thing is that when I do finally get up the courage to follow through, I'm so scared of death that the best case scenario is for someone to find me and save me so I can buy myself some time where I can just  for a little while longer. I don't know what would happen after that; I haven't gotten that far. Am I just looking for attention? I want a way out but I don't want to face my fears. I'm literally the biggest coward I know.  I don't want to be in this world and I don't deserve it either. "
I've been on this planet for 25 years and have zero accomplishments.,I have accomplished nothing. No friends. No partner. No job. I still live with my parents otherwise I'd be rotting on the streets. I can't keep living off them like a parasite. I feel like killing myself is the honorable thing to do rather than living like this.I'm short and balding. I'm social awkward. I don't share any interests with people and I'm always the odd person out in a crowd. FUCK THIS LIFE.
Won't it be wonderful...,"When we can truly place ourselves in a virtual reality. Our bodies sustained or suspended while our minds are fed dreams filled with whatever our heart desires. I'd like to think death is like that but I can't help but feel it would be more like nothingness, a lack of existence. It's just hard to comprehend because existence is all we've ever known.I'm tired. I'm angry, I'm bitter, I'm hurt.  I want to say I'm numb but I'm not when all those things are still present. I'm numb of joy, passion and hope. I was never built to survive, I live in a fantasy world that is my mind where everything is romanticised and everything means something.Let me continue living in that world til my last breath, let me pretend. Tell me about you instead. Tell me how your day was even if it was boring. Tell me of something you like to or would like to do no matter how small, like cuddling up on the sofa and watching a movie on a rainy day. Tell me your healthy passions and fantasies."
What are side effect did you got when you attempted suicide by overdose?,"I was in intensive care for 3 weeks, unconscious but I was told later I couldn't breathe by myself and I had to have dialysis while I was in there. When I came round I was in the renal high dependency unit because my kidneys had failed, so I had to have dialysis a lot. I relapsed on that ward where my lungs began to fill up with fluid and I almost died again. Luckily I recovered but still needed dialysis. Eventually after a month I started to become stable and was allowed home, I still have to go to hospital for monitoring and from that I also have blood clots on my lungs and I'm anemic. It's been two months now since I've been home and I'm still very weak, I can't walk far without being exhausted so I don't leave my house yet. I'm pretty much constantly sick and have trouble holding food down, which makes managing the anemia difficult. I can't take my mental health medication now because of my kidneys so I'm mentally worse off now than I was before I went in. I can't sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time even though I'm constantly exhausted, this leaves me with massive headaches. When I do sleep I have nightmares. I also itch a lot I'm not sure if it's the anemia or kidney damage so I'm going to a check up this week to find out. I have nasty scars on my neck from the dialysis which probably wont go. "
See you all on the other side!,"I'm sick of this university, everyone is rude and I haven't made any friends... I feel so trapped that I have to stay here for two years. I don't have any issues with money, grades or work, just sick of being alone. I have been alone for a while and this is when I snap, there is a balcony on the 3rd floor of my dorm, it's calling my name, see you all later!EDIT: Before I go, I've decided to make a game out of it. I'm gonna hide $10,000 around my campus and the key to my room and if they find it, they can take what they want from it, it's like a giant easter egg hunt."
Chronic pain is killing my will to live,Im chronically ill with debilitating migraines. I work to get health insurance that keeps me healthy enough to keep working for health insurance. Im in pain almost everyday. I dont want to wake up anymore. I have a wonderful boyfriend and amazing life with him but i cant stop feeling guilty. I put him through so much. With insurance i still have thousands in medical debt and cant afford to save for anything or pay down my school debt. I dont know what to do anymore. I dont want to be alive anymore.
How can I stop feeling worthless?,"So many people, my boss, my family, tell me that I'm pretty much worthless and think too much of myself. I really don't. It's just a front I put on so I don't have to face that part of me deep inside that agrees with them, that I have no purpose living this life. After just being told that I'm worthless for maybe the fourth time this week (and it's only Tuesday morning for God's sake), I can't stop the tears right now. The Germans used to say, that crying is a sign of admitting guilt whereas anger is a sign of innocence. I know I'm worthless. I believe them. I agree fully. Most of me doesn't see hope anymore and honestly, ending this pathetic sad tiring life would be such a satisfying release from this endless cycle of uselessness. Only a small part of me is left that doesn't wanna give in yet, I've seen how happy some people's life can get if they manage to find courage and worth in life, and I crave to have that myself someday. But with each passing day, I cave in and give up a little more. Can somebody please tell me how I can stop myself from feeling worthless and actually believe in myself? "
I don�۪t even know,"I keep complaining about my life because I hate it and I don�۪t want it at all but I�۪m here and I just want there to be some way out, some other way, without hurting anyone."
What's the alternative,"seriously. I have chosen not to die so many times when I wanted to and it leads nowhere. I'm already in therapy. I already take medication. I was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year. nothing makes any difference. I was kicked out of my school's counseling for using it too long, my new doctor blew me off for three weeks, and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds, two of which are now completely gone. (but hey, fuck it, I won't need them when I'm dead right)I never really want to die. theres just literally no way for me to live thats acceptable. i cant suffer through any more school. i dont want to go to work anymore. but my mom only pays for me because im a student and im too scared of people to get a real job, plus i have no skills and would fuck up and get yelled at all the time. if i quit, aside from ending up homeless, everyone at work would hate me for suddenly leaving and letting everyone down. i already left school last semester to go to the hospital. literally nothing is worse than failing that miserably twice in a row. maybe its stupid, but dying is the only legitimate excuse to get away from all responsibilities. because theyre too fucking hard. everyone says its so great to stay alive and survive depression but all i do is get punished for it. even if some things are good or i might be happy years from now its not worth it. i honestly fucking loathe myself and am tired of being stuck with me. seriously though, if you know actual viable alternatives please tell me. "
"Every time I come off my meds and it makes me remember what I'm like without them, I just lose so much hope.","I know coming off my meds is dangerous. I've done it once before and had to be hospitalized. I recently got pretty sick and wasn't able to stomach my meds so I'm mostly off of them at the moment and I'm just miserable. I know that it's just a phase that'll pass when I'm back on, but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who I am. I'm not able to naturally be happy, my brain doesn't work right, and I always think that in survival of the fittest I never should have made it. I think it's amazing I have, but I'm so young (22) and I just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and again. I'm just tired of it all. I'm not sure I'm actually suicidal right now, I'm just tired and hopeless. I know I'll be okay when I get back on my meds but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are. It's not fair, and I know the world isn't fair, but it's just a lot. I don't want to go through my whole life like this but I don't know that I have any other option. "
So sick of being told not to kill myself.,"No one will help.  Help doesn't exist.  At least not for me.  If no one will help, I'm sick of feeling like I have to reassure people I'm not less than two weeks from ending it all.  I'm sick of googling and being told to call the hotline.  I'm sick of being told to go to therapy.  I want to feel like someone gets it before I go.  I want the horrible truth not the patronizing lies.Edit:  honestly, what I'm saddest about is not seeing the end of Game of Thrones or hearing the next Panic! At the Disco album.  It isn't enough to continue, but felt like sharing."
Only 15 and boy am i done with life,"I just can't take this anxiety i feel everyday. School is tough. Teachers are unfair to me. My grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things. Its not the words that hurt me (cause i know that they actually don't mean it) Its the fact that they WANT hurt me that does. I also have a very bad connection with my dad and its like i don't know him anymore.
Also, a girl i really like was the only life goal i had in life. She was the only thing that kept me going and was the only reason i got up in the morning. I asked her out and said that i really liked her and she said that she felt the same way too. About 6 hours later she texted me and said she changed her mind and it absolutely crushed me. Even though its been a while now i still can't seem to move on
I also started smoking weed because its the only thing that can give me life but it seems like im growing an addiction to it sense i feel more more depressed without it.  I don't think i will really end my life sense i know how much that would've hurt mom and she have gone through enough shit already. But Its just so much work for me to fix all of this.I hope someone cares to read this. I feel desperate Edit: before anyone tells me what i felt was just teenage love ill just say that she was more symbolic then a love interest. I loved her so i could have a reason to live. But when that failed i just became empty. "
I dream happy dreams about my death and wonder about how my mind works.,"I've never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake ( that's mostly better now though... I sleep almost every night)But I am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression? I've spoken to people I know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesn't seem to fit how they describe it...Sometimes I get waves of despair and hopelessness, when this happens I literally can't even imagine a future, not even tomorrow... It scares me as my imagination is just taken away and I am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better. I mean this literally too, as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all...Other times I go numb, there's no emotion, no anything... The first time this happened was when my one of my parents was in hospital after a heart attack when I was 10. I logically without emotion made the decision to kill myself if they died. My other parent was crying, praying, pleading to people meanwhile I just became this emotionless logical creature doing maths puzzles working out how many ceiling tiles made up the ceiling of the hospital etc... My emotions only came back about 24 hours later the next evening when visiting the parent who had been taken into the hospital.I am constantly anxious and scared... A few people have noticed I can be very disconnected and remove myself to situations. I put on a good front but now I'm in my 30s I feel more fragile? In the past few years I've had bouts where I can't get suicide off of my mind, but the guilt of how it would effect my niece is the only thing that's kept me from doing it. I often have dreams of killing myself and seeing how everyone would quickly adapt, accept and be better off without me and these feel like happy dreams.When someone I knew killed themselves earlier this year people adapted and dealt with it so quickly... And I don't let people in as close as he did so they'd be fine if it were me."
im ugly,i am ugly and that makes me sad but atleast i am tall
Goodbye world this is it,I can't deal anylonger with my pain i'm tired i was blessed with nothing in my life i'm lost and stopped eating i'm finally at peace with my decision i know no one cares and that's ok it just makes it that much easier
Theres no reason to suffer,"If consciousness survives after death, it's reasonable to assume it doesn't age or die and is endless. If it doesn't, then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet. Either way, there is no point in continuing a human existence. Mine sucks, so why shouldn't I end it?"
"My life story, because I needed to get that out.","This is my first reddit post ever. Well, I don't really know where to start. Ever since I was 13, I've wanted to kill myself. I remember the first time I seriously contemplated taking my own life. I'm second oldest of 6 kids, so it gets pretty overwhelming and chaotic at my house sometimes.  At the time, my entire family (6 people at the time, with my pregnant mom), my aunt and uncle, our babysitter/close family friend, and one of my family's friend who was my age were in a beach house together. By some miracle, I had my own room and I was laying on my bed. I was thinking about my life. The entire summer, my dad and my older brother had been picking on me. They would fuck around with me, taking my stuff and throwing it back and worth, jokingly calling me insults. They were like school bullies, but I was homeschooled so it was a constant thing. It wasn't that bad looking back on it, and I don't know why it was making me hurt so bad. So many other people go through so much more and they remain stronger than I ever am. But this continued throughout the years, getting worse by the day. My family moves around about every 4-5 months, so I can't enroll in normal school. I don't have trouble making friends, but after constantly moving and knowing I would never see my friends again made me not even try to anymore. So, I became isolated, and I was constantly bored of my life. I had no social life at all at some times and it didn't really help that I have super conservative parents, who might actually be crazy. I'm not allowed to hang out with guys (my mom told me before going off to a summer program that she would rather see me do drugs than have a boyfriend), I'm not allowed out without a thorough explanation of where I am going and what I am doing and even then they might say no, and a bunch of other crazy rules. So, naturally I spent all my free time on the internet. One summer, I saw my brother had a tinder account, and I decided to make one. I was 13 at the time, and that's a ridiculous age to be on tinder. So I start to go on it, and I'm chatting with all these random dudes. They're telling me exactly what I needed to hear. Compliments. Of course, their end goals are nudes and sex, but I was eating it up. And then I started sending nudes. I was so insecure about myself that I resorted to finding horny guys on the internet to make me feel good enough about myself. I used the app on and off for a couple years (I never met up with anybody from it), whenever I needed a quick boost of confidence. The story goes on, and throughout those few years I was a really good kid. At 14 I got into an Ivy League university and since then I've been taking classes (class of 2019!). But then I began acting out. I started to not really care about my classes (I wasn't failing at all, but not doing as good as before), and I yearned to go out and party my ass off. So when living in a strict boarding school, I completely isolated myself from everyone. I didn't have a roommate and during the day I would do whatever I had to (tennis practice and go to the school room) and then I'd go right back to my room and do whatever. My younger sister also went to that school, and we have a history. I won't go extremely in depth, but my whole life she has literally been out to get me. And while we were at the school together, she made it her #1 priority to make everyone think I was weird. She made up stories about me to them, spread rumors and a bunch of other petty stuff. But after Christmas break, I was fixated on getting lit, so I became a social person again. I told everyone I just had a super difficult last semester, but now I have an easier one so more time on my hands. I hung out with people, made friends, started to be known by people. And the first week, my new roommate brought me with her when she snuck up into the room of the two ""cool and popular"" girls of the school. We snuck out of our rooms and sprinted up, and when we got there they weren't expecting me to be there and got kinda weirded out. It was really awkward at first, but then they asked me  what was a really bad but kinda funny thing I did and I straight up said ""I 69 with a guy once, but I don't think that's really for me"" and as most high school girls would, they got a kick outta that. So we started talking more, and they realized I was actually kinda cool and funny and then they told me how my sister (we'll call her G) told them that I was so weird and this and that. But they liked me, so I was like ok cool. This ""friendship"" (it was obviously bs and fake, because these girls are the fakest people I've ever met) started to grow and then one day the most popular girl got her adderall in the mail (her mom would mail it to her every month), and she was like ""wanna try it?"". So I did, because I'd been wanting to try it . This was the first time I did drugs or anything (even drinking), but I had wanted to. I had a great first experience with it, I ended up staying up all night (dumb me took it at 9:30 at night) and I got all my homework done for the week and organized my entire room. It was great. So after that, I bought 7 pills from her to use on special occasions (midterms, finals, only when I needed it). This April (all of this is pretty recent), I got suspended from that boarding school for 2 weeks (it's pretty hard to get suspended from a boarding school, because they have to send you home and some kids lived out of the country), because I got drunk in a guy's room (we weren't allowed into the guys' rooms as girls and vice-versa). This was my most fucked up night ever. The popular girl (We will call her ""B"") forced herself onto me and kissed me, then pushed me down and I hit my head on the side of the bed (only was bleeding a tiny bit) and both of us made out with the 3 other guys there. She ends up going into the bathroom with two other guys (doing who knows what) so my drunken self was determined to keep her from getting raped or anything like that (she was sooo wasted and out of it), but I am a pretty small girl, so it was hard for me to do something when a guy who is 6'1"" is telling me he's gonna beat the shit out of me if I don't shut tf up. But I persisted, and got her out of there and kept on fighting off guys that would try to take advantage of her. Long story short, we both got back to our rooms after she threw up all over their bathroom. And then we got caught and the next day were asked all about what had happened. Well, I learned nothing from this, just that I didn't regret doing that at all and wanted to do something like that again (minus all those fucked up things). So I served my suspension, and my strict parents were so fucking mad during it. I have no idea what they were thinking, but they sent me back there. This time, with another sister in tow. I began to get into vaping and I ordered a bunch of shit online and got it delivered there. And then this kid came along and started talking about wanting a vape and I offered to get him one. I overcharged tf outta him and made some money (my parents don't give me any, so I gotta make my own) and so we started with vaping. Then we got nicotine juice, and then we moved to weed. I fell in love with weed. But with my crazy sister always around, she eventually found out through overhearing conversation and interrogating people about me, and began to spread some crazy rumors. So then, she told the head at our school and I was so close to being drug tested (I was throwing up because I was sick the day they were going to take me). I would've failed and prob be expelled. G continued to blackmail me, threatening to tell everyone. I also found out she was showing people a vid she took of me once (I have absolutely no idea how she took it) masturbating. So, she was spying on me too and recording it.I was devastated after this, and asked her why she was doing all of this to me. She thought it was all a funny joke. And I said we would be better off as friends than enemies and she said ""I don't give a fuck about you"". That hurt me the most through all of this. I cut myself for a brief period of time, and then realized it wasn't for me. So now, I smoke weed everyday, just to escape from these memories that I can't let go of. My friend commuted suicide last weekend, and it impacted me quite a bit, in that I realized the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my two closest friends. They don't even know it, but they're the reason I stick around. I want to get away from my family, but I don't know how to. I want to tell my parents that I'm suicidal all the time and that I need help, but I can't. My brother attempted to kill himself about 2 years ago my slitting his wrist (then he called the cops on himself) and when they were talking about this, they told me and my two younger siblings that he was doing it to hurt them because they were putting pressure on him to get his GED. They laughed at what he did, and kept him in the mental hospital for a couple extra days so he could ""learn his lesson"". They took his fucking shoelaces away and they laughed at him. I was speechless that they would say this, especially to their 11,12 and 14 year old kids. I'm 16 now, and I want to move out, the only way I can be happy is when I'm away with them, but they won't let me. Any tips on how to get through the next two years living with them? Sorry for the essay lol, I just don't know why I hate my life so much, because again so many people have been through so much more. I'm so grateful that I have these opportunities and I wish I could give it all to someone who has nothing, because I'm not worthy of what I have. Thanks for listening,-S"
Life got fucked up by family,"So I was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were Jehovah witnesses.I have never gone to somebody house before because the think anything that requires you to interact with people who aren�۪t in their ���religion�۝ is Satan trying to persuade you.
              I�۪m a high schooler and pretty much athletics has been the only thing to keep me going.Im almost positive I have a lot mental disorders simply because of the lack of interaction I�۪ve gotten.The only places I�۪ve ever been to in my life has been the store, their ���meetings�۝, school, and home.Anyways, I joined athletics and discovered that I am actually pretty good at wrestling.As soon as I joined it my grades skyrocketed and I�۪ve been so happy. I shouldn�۪t have tried.Pretty much now they banned me from doing that because it�۪s also ���bad association�۝I�۪m tired of living a life like this and I can�۪t see any good place my life is headed.It would be extremely hard for me to even try going to college and if I do try to make a life that is good, I know that everybody I know will shun me.
        It just feels like I�۪m wasting my time by living and it�۪s just going to cause me more suffering.The one thing that made me think better about life now gets ripped away from me. I cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by ���gods word�۝
   I�۪m thinking about ending it all soon, although it�۪s not like anybody would miss me as I have no friends because those are banned too unless it�۪s someone from our church."
I want to die alone,"What I honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer, but not tell anyone. I want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded. No horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it, right? Nobody will really notice. I'll just pass out of memory, as it should be. "
"Not sure what to do, it's getting harder and harder to get out of bed","Hey all, it's my first time posting here and I'm not really sure what to write, so I'll just ramble on. I've had pretty bad depression for about 4 years now, and just over 2 years ago I finally came out to my family about my depression and suicidal thoughts and got some help.I guess I'm a person who needs to be in a relationship. Not long after seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist (who started me on 2 meds) I started seeing someone who I met online, and we got married a year later. I was really happy in that relationship, but we were from 2 different countries. We were together, but there was a million hurdles towards getting residency that took a toll on our relationship. Eventually we decided to get separated, and I moved back home. That was about 3 months ago, and it's been hell ever since.I've always had trouble sleeping, but now all I can think about is my wife. Literally every night I think about how if things don't work out, I don't want to continue living. It's gotten so bad that I will stay up until I pass out, so I don't have to deal with my inner thoughts. One of the most depressing things for me is that I have every opportunity in the world to do anything I want. I'm not rich by any means, but my family isn't poor. My parents are super supportive, and my home life is great. The fact that I feel this way makes me even more depressed, because tons of people have it worse than I do, but they make it work. I have never attempted suicide before, but I've come close a few times. My main reason for not doing it, is that it would destroy my family. While that keeps me going, it doesn't solve anything. I have no goals, no dreams, and all I wanted to do was be with my wife overseas. I'm in no position to seek another relationship, but I also feel like I'm only happy when I'm with someone. Anywho, I guess I just wanted to see this all written out. My willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on. Thanks for reading."
Probably going to delete this,"Basically, I have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now. I went from being legitimately suicidal, to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts. I am not currently in danger, but I wanted some help. I frequently think of what would happen if I killed myself. I think of the personal experience,  the pain, the person that finds me, the people that may or not care about me, how it would affect family and friends, does it make me go to Hell, etc.Is this something to be concerned about? Again, this may be deleted to cover up my emotions, but I wanted to get some help first.Thank you all."
I Feel Like My Time Is Running Out.,A few months ago I wrote a list of things I wanted to watch/play/listen/read before killing myself. I've now done pretty much everything in that list except one thing; watch Blade Runner 2049. Come Thursday I feel like my time is up. I don't really see a reason to carry on anymore. I don't want to carry on anymore.
"Sitting alone, crying a forest with a bunch of pills in my hand. I am so close.","Denial, rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken, offended heart. Would have started therapy in 4 days, but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if, then it takes years. I have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore. No one to talk to, alone since 7 years. Not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone, because im unable to talk to people and to go outside anyway. I did my best to make it that long. There is no more hope. Im over the edge. All bad emotions at once. Im crying at least 1 hour every night. Im so done. No one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me. I hate myself. Its too much."
Does anyone know the legal procedures following my suicide?,"So I signed a personal guarantee for a lease I have for a business.  The business is failing really hard, and I just don't have the energy to deal with it, or life, anymore.  So I'm wondering what would happen if I died by SIGW, and then  the Landlord sued us personally (not the business).  Would it still go through?  My mother and brother (who is not in the picture) are the other personal guarantors. I know the Landlord company will sue my parents until bankruptcy, because that is what they do lol... But I'm curious as to what my death might mean legally for my parents.  I'm trying to set them up for the worst case scenario because it is likely to happen. "
It's literally all I've been thinking about,"Not a day goes by where I don't plan to kill myself.  I keep shaking and having panic attacks in public.  I can't take this anymore.  I tried to go to the hospital on Friday in hopes that they could keep me safe from myself for a while, maybe even treat me.  I don't know what to do anymore.  "
"No matter what I do, I still keep coming back here and keep feeling suicidal",Me too. I guess that's why they say it's a fight. Is the fight worth it? I don't know. I don't really believe it is.
I might kill my self on Saturday,"I hate myself and I feel so miserable and lonely. Sometimes I regret having happy moments because when the bad times come, it just hits so hard. I might take a Lyft and jump off a bridge. I am so selfish I want to care about myself instead of others, just once and this will be the only time. I'm not sure if I'll do it but my god, right now I hope my future self could. Edit: I just took 400mg of Prozac. Idk what to expect but I feel woozy"
Feel Horrible,"Im not sure why, but for the past few days, I've felt so horrible I want to die. This isn't the first time I've felt this way, and it probably wont be the last. I have a midterm tomorrow, but I feel so bad I can't bring myself to study for it. I need to pass all my classes this semester. I can't afford to comw back another semester. I really just want to end it. I probably won't get a job even if I do graduate this semester. I have a crappy gpa, no co-ops/internships, and hardly any experience. I have no friends bc I've pretty much always devoted myself to my studies and social interactions exhaust me. I don't know what to do, I'm just tired of feeling horrible and tired of worrying if I'm good enough. I don't want to kill myself bc I know that would hurt my family and I also believe in Heaven and Hell, and suicide is a sin.But I'm tired of living too. I've started to realize I'm rarely ever happy anymore. The only times I am happy, it's not bc of anything real but bc of something used to distract myself from the real world: a game, anime, tv show, etc.I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to talk to someone with no judgement."
No one would probably care...,"Hi. I'm a 14 year old boy that lives in the US. I really don't know if I'm depressed or not but I just want to kill myself from day to day. Honestly at first it was fine. I would get sad and want to kill myself and all but it will die down. It would come in spikes correlating to when I get super sad. My dad and mom is idk. Strict in a way. My dad is a scary man, even my mom is scared of him. My mom is nice and supportive but she changed because of my dad lately. Everyone has. My sister even had a breakdown saying she wanted to kill herself for the longest time. But now back to me. I'm literally crying right now. My dad is idk, a dictator in a way, he has his ways and he will follow them. He is the only way money comes in as my mom is a housewife. But actually back to me. Lately, I been sad like usual. But nowadays for about a month now, it is constant. It hasn't been like the spikes of depression I used to have, and I have been crying a lot. In fact I think I cried more in a span of 2 months than the span of 2 years before that. I'm constantly sad and thinking of dying quietly and just catch a breath. But there is one thing that saves me. It's school and I can keep a smile on in front of everyone. I mean I got friends and I got girls that I would like to impress not drive away. I'm just sad, Idk if this is depression or what but whatever. Sorry. I just wanted to spread my feelings as I have no one to truly give myself out to. I mean it's the internet. What could go wrong ? :) If you read til the end, thank you but I just wanted to throw my thoughts and feelings out somewhere. I'll do fine I think."
wrote something down for the first time in like a year and it�۪s my suicide note,"just what the title says. so here goesNot sure what to do anymore. Always been shy. didn�۪t learn how to be responsible, accountable. No study habits. No sense of finance and bills. Parents still paying my bills. I know where to go to seek help, what to do, just not how to ask for help. Failing classes, neglecting academics and career. can�۪t get myself to study even though I have an exam tomorrow which I know i�۪m probably gonna fail. haven�۪t turned in any assignments yet and they�۪re all more than a week past due date now. don�۪t know how to talk to people, how to communicate. haven�۪t spoken to anyone in class yet, not even the professors. Never had a proper relationship with anyone, no friends let alone a girlfriend or any romantic relationships, never held hands with anyone or kissed anyone, sex is just something other people have that I can�۪t, just like all other human experiences. haven�۪t eaten a proper meal in a month now. Just surviving on water, coffee, bread, milk and alcohol. Smoking a pack a day. Barely sleeping or sleeping too much. No physical exercise or socializing. Just wasting my parents resources and retirement funds. haven�۪t spoken to my sister in over four years now. But she already has a good job and is graduating in spring so i�۪m happy for her. She means the world to me even though we�۪re not even on speaking terms. Pushing away friends and family. Difficulty in communicating is taking a toll. i�۪m so behind in all my classes but I can�۪t ask for help from professors because what will they think of a grad student who doesn�۪t spend enough time studying. haven�۪t spoken to anyone in class yet so no study groups either. i�۪m running out of pain killers that I brought along from back home and I don�۪t know how i�۪d muster enough confidence to go out and get more by myself. i�۪m 24, six feet tall but weigh around fifty five kilos. My arms look like spider legs. My acne won�۪t go away and makes my face look like a jackson pollock painting. My hips are hurting most of the time as is my shoulder and my back. I just want to end it all and if that means ending my life then so be it. I know I am going to kill myself. Maybe not now, not today, not this week or even not in the next few years or ten years. But that is how I will end I am sure of it. I smoke in the hopes of getting cancer or a heart attack from clogged arteries. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, no hope for the future, everything seems pointless.Wow, I am one fucked up non functioning non human. To anyone who manages to access this note, just know that this wasn�۪t meant to be found or shared. But if you�۪re here, chances are that you�۪d have been looking for something like this. And I may not be around anymore. So I can�۪t hide it anymore or ask you to keep this secret, but I request you not to share it. If you feel this is too much information for one person to carry, I ask you only share it with my father and no one else. so long."
A feeling ...,"I have a feeling that this year is going to be my last year.I never had such feelings before. I�۪ve been depressed for more than three quarters of a decade, and during this time it kept getting worse and worse. Recently I decided that I have had enough and I want to rest. I�۪m nothing but a failure and i drag everyone around me down. I�۪ve never been good at anything, always disappointed everyone around me and I don�۪t have real life friends. Haven�۪t had any in many years. I had a person I loves but she�۪s gone and never coming back (didn�۪t work out i guess. She never loved me to begin with, but whatever)You get to a point where you just wonder if its all in your head or if its real. I genuinely don�۪t know if i am crazy or not. Fuck it. I feel at peace and happy with my decision. I shan�۪t be missed or whatever. C�۪est la vie. I�۪ll be back on the day I do it to say good bye. Not like it matters. I�۪m a bitter asshole. "
Graduate Student and I Can't Take It Anymore,"Hi Everyone, I'm 25/F and in grad school for a masters degree that I don't really want anymore. My parents convinced me it would help me get a good job, but I have no idea how much longer it's going to take, and my anxiety is only getting worse. I have tried consulting a psychologist and therapist, but I am still covered through my parents insurance, and they do not want me on any anti depressants or anti anxiety medication. So here I am. I know my parents mean well, and I am lucky they are able to still help support me, but I can't take this anymore. I wish I could just leave or drop out, but my loans coming out of deferment would likely cause them a lot of financial issues. I have a boyfriend of 4.5 years that is incredibly supportive and tries to help when he can. I have a history of self harm (hitting myself) that has relapsed since I began grad school, and only he knows about it. I am too afraid of pain and hurting those around me to actually commit suicide, but I have had an overwhelming feeling on and off over the years that I wish I could get in a bad accident, or have something bad happen to me. I wish more than anything that I could drop out and just move on with life."
Today was the first time I thought about suicide and it was scary,"I've always had this positive attitude about anything, but now I'm just tired. Tired of life and everything.School is hard. I can't even imagine going through the next three years only to then lose all my friends.Ah. Friends - well I don't have many real friends, a handful to be exact, but that's not the problem, I'm happy with those I have + I get along with many people.Love is my problem. I know, I know. I'll get over her. I've heard that so many times, I'm getting sick of it. You know, I'm in love with one of my real, good friends. But she doesn't like me as much as she likes others. I feel like a second class friend when we're around with other friends of ours. I have oneitis.I'm also very, very ugly and kinda fat. But I'm currently trying to fix the latter so that might not be a problem in a year. Ugliness won't go away. That's also why I won't have a chance with her.And today, I've been at this girl's house with others and I was the last to leave. I couldn't say a word to her. I just said ""Bye"" and left. I hate myself now, can't even talk to a girl.I was alone waiting for the bus in the pouring rain, and there it happened: Why not kill myself here and now? Solves my problems once and for all.Sorry if this isn't the place for this, I'm just scared of what will come next. Will this repeat itself when I'm alone again? Will I eventually attempt suicide? It's the first time I've had this problem and it really scares me.I'm not at risk, just tired and scared. I want my problems solved but I can't do it myself."
Does calling the cops on yourself take money?,"I'm a 16 year old from California. I read somewhere that if you call the cops on yourself for being suicidal, they'll take you to a hospital. I don't know if that will cost any money though for the stay, cause my family is having financial problems right now and I don't want to make us go so far into debt."
I tried to jump off my balcony last night,My husband caught me. I�۪m sad.
Work again or check in,"To the hospital as recommended?  I always ask for a Permanent rest.  And no-one can provide or afford that for me.  It's not really of value for people to just rest all the time.
My soul is really broken and I'm in more pain than is worthwhile. So what's your plan for me? After all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization? It's clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope I keep working. Put the onus on me to keep functioning and that's a plan failure"
"I've tried everything else, I just can not go on another day","I've decided that I can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today, I am not sure as I am posting here perhaps it is because I have no one that cares about me so I just want to get it off my chest.
My life is so diffifult and recently got 20 x worse
I came across this subreddit when I searched for suicide help/Hotlines etc I contacted 3 of them and WOW what I waste that is all saying the WRONG things and very generic , DO NOT say to a suicidal person anything about family from what would they think  or think about them ... Anything chances are the person A has no family or B ( me) had a horrible childhood where they were abused etc. point is the hotlines made me feel worse.
I could ramble on forever but no one likes a sob story
I went from a good job and decent life to losing nearly everything in not a long time span it's been a decline and got more and more depressed with each day, my main reason now is  am less than broke I have been through some real shit and do not want - no can not deal - going from a real apt to a shitier one and another and another to a shitty temp spot sometimes I don't eat
I bust my ass to help myself no am not improving  I have been paying for a weekly room which I am overdue on and I will be on the street tomorrow - in fkn NYC - the worst of the worst, If I don't do it myself someone will stab me on the subway at least.
Not to mention Dr's don't want to hear me out or help they don't care ( at least not in this city ) I have no religion o PLEASE do not come at me with that but that is it a not so young 30-something year old guy I see no other way out."
pontos vs the rope,"So I'm 25 years old and have several health issues for many years now, mostly chronic pain (RLS, ""burning"" eyes and some other stuff), none of which could be cured or even be reduced to an acceptable level yet.
In addition to that there are some other problems like mouches volantes, which really drive me crazy.
I know that the mentioned things are considered ""harmless"", but that's only true for the physical part.
I'm rarely sleeping more than 5 hours, and when I wake up the first thing I feel is pain. Legs, eyes, everywhere.
I'm also having a slight form of socialphobia. It's not that I can't talk to people or instantly panic when there are more than 3 people around me, I can manage it pretty well, but it still doesn't feel good.All of those things don't exactly make it easy for me to wake up, jump out of my bed and scream ""What a beautiful day!"".
So afterall I dropped university this spring cause I couldn't handle it anymore. I got some tiny jobs here and there, but afterall it wasn't enough - and of course I wasn't going anywhere with it.So now I got kicked out of my flat (because I couldn't pay the bills), have no money, no place to go and still a few hundred bucks I need to pay. Well I know a few hundred bucks may not sound much, but for me it is a hell of a lot.So right now I literally have nothing. No health, no future, no money.This may sound like a spontaneous reaction - but it's not.
I had suicidal thoughts years ago before I left university, but it was not the typical ""My girlfriend left me, I'm so sad!"" or whatever stuff, I had serious problems for years and had enough time to think about all of that.
I'm not talking about ""soon I'm going to kill myself ... if I want to ... maybe"", but about placing a rope next to me and trying to have the guts to do it.Probably the only reason I haven't done it yet are my parents, especially my lovely mom.
But with every day passing I tend more and more to do it anyways, because I see no other option.I know that there are people that have very serious problems and/or a terrible life, and they have my biggest respect if they keep on going, but I can't.
When life becomes a painful struggle every single day, without the hope for anything to change, it is not worth living in my opinion."
"Can I talk to somebody please, I've asked my friends if I can call them for abit but nobody is responding. I feel like I might just leap off today.",hey man
How to reconnect with yourself,"This may not be the place. But I�۪m just coming off of a 5 day binge and nights with suicidal thoughts. For you, what are some recovery methods you�۪ve done to bounce back? If you even decide to do that. Again I don�۪t know if this is the right place."
I need someone.,"I just need to vent. Everything has come crashing down, and I need someone to talk to. "
"I've been waiting for things to get better for years, I'm tired of waiting","Everything is the same.
All my problems are vicious cycles.
Don't know how to break the loop.
Looks like I'll just wait forever and die waiting.
Things won't get better.

Ending things now is a solution.
Don't want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless.
Don't want to be a bad friend anymore.
Don't want to be a bad son anymore.
Don't want to be a bad parent.
Don't want to be a worthless human being.  "
"My mind is telling me to kill myself, please someone, anyone, be the voice of reason...",Im so scared
"I realized my existence has no meaning, the only thing I do is hurt people even by simply posting here.",None of this matters I'm useless.
I've been teeter-tottering on the edge for the past few months,"Which isn't saying much, since I think about suicide a lot. But lately, I've really wanted to go through with it. I'm just tired, I'm tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and I can't stand it any longer. I don't trust any government institutions like therapists, I've taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than I already was or just not work at all. I can't even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or I could go to prison if I did. My health is shit, it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors I keep going to tell me everything is fine, I just need to lose weight - even though I already have a eating disorder (and lost 100 pounds, and I'm not even that fat) and can't exercise very much due to my shitty health. Speaking of shitty health, I can't work anywhere because of it and so I'm destined to be on disability my entire life. I can't even afford my basic needs, I have to steal from the grocery store just to be able to eat a nutritious diet that doesn't consist of mostly sugar, calories and salt. I am going to end up homeless because rent everywhere is getting way too expensive for me to even afford and every place that offers housing assistance is packed full (I hate apartment living anyways), and I'd actually prefer homelessness, if it meant that I didn't have to live with a shitty roommate (which I've only had 2 roommates ever who weren't shitty abusive people). I can't do relationships or get close to anyone, I'm too PTSD'd about trauma from shit that has been done to me by other people all of my life and I can't get close to anyone because I have to keep important details of my life hidden away from people, so I basically have to be dishonest with people in order for anyone to even want to be in my life. Meditation, I don't get...some new age BS that doesn't accomplish anything for me. I've tried CBT exercises, that doesn't work either because a lot of it is wishy washy BS (or is at least presented that way) and doesn't reflect reality, especially my reality.I could go on and on about how my entire life is one great big shit show (including all the bullying, rapes, abuse from parents and teachers, having kids who don't even know my name, etc.), but it would take forever and doesn't help anything. The main point is that I don't really remember having any genuinely happy moments in life other than small things that happen once in a blue moon that I quickly lose interest in. I might get a bit excited to be able to try a food, watch a new movie or show, or a new song I found...but it's super rare, like a couple times a year sort of rare. Everything else is just constant misery, me feeling like a prisoner in my own skin and of a society I never gave permission to participate in. If I could change my circumstances, I would. I have literally exhausted just about every option that I could take to make my life better. I don't have any options except for saving up money for literally YEARS just to be able to make/record music in hopes I can make some sort of liveable income from that and isolate myself off grid until I have to do a music tour somewhere, and I can't wait that long and don't think my health could even allow me to do that, especially not 10 years from now. I am at my wits end. I am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me, is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery I feel. I am already thinking about how to plan my death, including figuring out where my cat will go, funeral options, exit plan, etc. I don't want to die TBH, but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it....except my cat."
How can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself.,"I've been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worse, i'm the biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do. I've moved house eight times over my life, i can never keep a friend, my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them, my eye contact is poor or too intense i don't understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together. I avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit. I've tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing it's horrible, I've tried various self harm, and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone (worst night of my life)
I've been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive.
I've recently completely lost all my enthusiasm
I haven't told anyone this.
I feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself.sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you."
Somebody please stop me I was so close today I couldnt swallow the pills I was too weak,"""Pain doesn't end, it will continue onto to others that care for you."" I heard this before and i believe that even though they don't say it, many people care for you. You and I should live til we can"
"Even with therapy and medication, I want to be dead so I don't have to suffer.","I'm seeing a therapist, I'm on Zoloft and Xanax, and I still want to die.  I have the means and access.  I think about it.  I think it's going to be good for me that I don't have to feel this way anymore.  My wife is supportive, my parents aren't in the picture concerning my emotional well-being, my friends are supportive, but I just want to die.  I want to end it.  I want to have no more of this.  I'm the common thread to all my problems and the one thing I haven't tried yet is removing myself from the equation.  I don't know if I could do it but I wish I could, because even though I've done everything right both in life and in trying to be good about self-care, I just can't stop feeling like I can't do anything good in the long run, I can't help my wife through her medical situations, and I can't hold up the burden of the house nor can I ask her to help because of said medical problems.  I can't logically think of a reason to stop myself, because what people say you're supposed to do just doesn't seem like it's working, and if I tell my therapist or psychiatrist that I'm in crisis, I'm going to have to go through all this again and I don't want to go through it anymore.  "
Am I depressed or am I just looking for attention?,"I definitely have anxiety and I think I have some kind of borderline disorder. I'm 16 and I had one friend in the world until my ""clinginess"" made him put a lot of space between us. I feel like I am battling myself to be a well rounded person. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I'm destined to fail in life because of it. All I want in life is to start a family and grow old I feel like I won't be able to do that because of the bad part of my personality. When I am faced with thoughts of how I have no friends or examples of my own inadequacy, I fall down this slippery slope of what I think is depression. I get this pit in my stomach and I don't want to do anything but sit and stew on those feelings. When I get this way all I do is lay down or talk about how I should kill myself. I don't think I'd ever actually do it because my family loves me but I've noticed myself doing it just to make people notice. Is it all just made up in the back of my head to get people's attention?"
Dealing with too much right now,Feeling very depressed and anxious. Also nauseous and might have to vomit entire night again. I don't think I'll ever be happy as much as my childhood daysmy head rewinds every bad thing happened in the past a lot. If I had a painless and quick method I would be out already
Why is there no limit?,"Don�۪t call it ""the easy way out"". It�۪s just . It�۪s not easy getting to that point, it�۪s not an easy decision to make, it�۪s not a deadline I have 0 issue setting. I know what it will do to everyone I love and the people who love me (even if there�۪s not many), that�۪s not an easy thing to do to someone by any means.I see it as my  to be selfish, the  I put myself, , first and I only see everyone trying to stop me, again.Again I�۪m supposed to do what everyone else wants, I�۪m supposed to keep suffering to make everyone else feel like they are doing good. I�۪m supposed to fight because everyone else wants me to, I�۪m supposed to fight despite it being those same peoples fault (to some degree) that I�۪m even here in the first place.Why is there no limit to how long you have to suffer ""just"" because it�۪s ���in your head�۪? If I had cancer for the 50th time, wanting to just end it all instead of treating it one more time, everyone would be on my side."
When suffering is too great,"I would like to start by saying that, although brief, I would need a million words to encompass the suffering I have endured in the past 3 years.I am currently at a stage where I am thinking about committing suicide daily, and frequently at that. I have even tried desensitizing to various methods, drowning etc by imagining them in depth. The level of suffering has increased to a stage where I believe that I could overcome the thought of hurting people that I love, because my suffering has greatly exceeded it. As you are probably well aware, the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring child's or family suicide is unbearable for them. The grief it would cause my mother, who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great.My problems may seem unbelievable, but I assure you everything I am about to tell you is the truth, not embellished in the slightest.When I was 17 I moved south in the UK to study. During that time I fell ill with mild depression and anxiety. Nothing out of sorts, just mills problems. Looking back now, it was probably the happiest time of my life. I lived well with 4 other people and managed socially and at university. I worked regularly at health shops and other retail shops.By the third year of my course I had experimented heavily with drugs. This was fine, I was fine. I smoked cannabis regularly and was often in a blissful state at the end of the day, no worries.I fell into homelessness after my degree ended like a daydream or a fever. I had many friends, this wasn't something to worry about. I relished in this until things became serious. I stayed at multiple people's flats for months on end, supplying them with food to help. I was oblivious to my immediate situation and when the last person I knew and a good year of sofa surfing had ended  I was stranded. By the time it had ended, I was only barely aware of the way I had been coping and that was with multiple opiates and cannabis. By the end of this period I had developed pretty severe social anxiety, characterised by sensorimotor OCD and an inability to communicate with new people without being completely aware of my expressions and movements.I had no option of my family helping me (already asked for way to much) and I turned to the local authorities. I was addicted to painkillers, unable to find a place to stay and lost. I eventually ended up in a hostel, and by all accounts was an absolute godsend. I lived with other temporarily homeless people and began working within the TJX industry. Now with relatively few people I knew, I didn't learn any of the things a person should try if thru felt depressed, angst or other side. Nobody taught my how to cope. I continued opiate abuse and eventually quit my job. I was offered a move on ""flat"" by BHT a local charity and it turned out to be the worst decision I could possibly have made.I would like to say now that this was BLISS compared to what I experience right now. Nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental torture that was to come.This next section is something wrote about 4 months ago. I would like you to read this and then I may continue. I will mark the section.My progression from a functioning human being to a total social recluse who is both now chronically physically and mentally unwell was rapid. There will be no exaggeration or embellishment in my writing and everything I say is true. I'm glad I have found this place.Following my university course, and subsequent mental health issues and drug abuse, I went through anxiety to anxiety, chronic depression to psychosis. None of the things that I just mentioned, while serious, even touch how much I have suffered in the last year of my life due to my living conditions, random illness and unlucky circumstances. I truly didn't know what suffering was until this time.A few years after my degree I wasn't doing to well and I became homeless after I failed to find a house after I was sharing with others. I had a few minor friends that let me stay at their house, but nobody I was especially close to or a base in which I could reclaim my life. At this point I would like to mention, that while I do have family, I rarely have contact with them due to differences. At that point there is no circumstance where I would have been able to live at home.��Things progressed and I was declared homeless and sought hostels in a housing association in Brighton called BHT. I worked in retail and paid a portion of my rent and was getting better physically and emotionally and decided it was time to move. BHT had a scheme in place where they would help you find somewhere to live and one day when the support workers came over (as per usual on Wednesday), they laid out in the table what was to be the worst thing that ever happened to me.I was shown an 'experimental' housing project that consisted of shipping containers, much like those used in Holland for students. We were provided with artist impressions and it looked very clean. Best of all there we NO deposits or rent in advance and the full �657 rent was to be covered in full by the local housing benefit. I was immediately interested and began building a portfolio, which was required to sign up and and interview was to be taken.��I did all the necessary paperwork and was invited to a group meeting with other tenants who has signed up. When I arrived we were briefed for a couple of hours. We were told about the location, how we would pay electricity etc. I made a good impression an was accepted and all the arrangements were made to move in.This is when it all began.My first experience with the containers was an ugly one. Not only were they nothing like the artists impression, they were stuffed in front of a metal scrap yard and a pub which had just been demolished. I later found out that it was because of unsafe chemicals in the earth below the pub. These containers stuck out like a sore thumb and all I could think of when moving in was how much like prison it looked. Boy was I right. But I had no right to complain, I had nothing and nowhere to go, this was a lot better than living on the street, or so I thought.About a month after I moved in the antics began. I remember after night of drunks and drug addicts screaming, shouting a fighting courtyard. People smashing up parts of the containers and ripping off postboxes. The front of the containers was a showcase to the road and with both front and back being glass windows (the whole piece, with a door). Since there was no lock or fob system, people from Friday night and Saturday night poured in and caused havoc. It is situated just at the end of London road, probably the worst part of the city. There is no gap between the containers, they are all lined up like prison cells and stacked straight in top of each other with corrugated stairs.People would stare and take pictures in the day. and they would mock me and trample around my front door in the evening. Nobody's business was their own, if my neighbours were partying, everonr else had to put up with it and the stairs would fill with people jacking up or cracking up.��I distinctly remember feeling utterly hopeless and alone one night when a group of men came to the top floor and stood looking at the road from outside my door. They had obviously been on a night out and some were drunk. I remember the words outside my container. ""If I lived here I would jump of this floor and kill myself"" and preceded to laugh and joke about what low life's must be here.A year later and things were getting atrocious. Violent neighbours and their visiters ran rampage over the whole project. Every night was the worse than I could have imagine. Screaming, fighting, stabbings, rape and everything in between became normal. People would trash thier whole flats and scatter glass over the courtyard, and throw all of their rubbish in the bit just beside the containers. I would never have been able to dream up this madness. When I mean there were people screaming for hours on end, I mean it LITERALLY. Residents absolutely off their minds running round naked and shouting at the TOP of their lungs for hours and hours on end. Men assaulting women and there were cases of rape also. People flats were rushed for people seeking revenge for missed drug money. The place was completely out of control and the visits from the police and ambulances were so frequent, every one I heard go by I though was for the containers. This was EVERY day and night, no exception. Two people committed suicide.I have had people try my handle I was sleeping, try and break my door down and rush a flat I was speaking to a neighbour in looking to kill or beat to a pulp someone who has nothing to do with me. I had people asking me for money I. A daily basis and the walk up to my flat was hell with residents heckling me and wanting anything and everything from me.I made one friend there who was poet and wanted to help him record. He set up an anxiety talk in his flat for the good residents and we all made our case to the housing association and got many signatures for a petition to help with the project.We had frequent meetings with Andy Winter the CEO of BHT. We all spilled our hearts out about how bad it was living here and how security cameras a gate lock etc needs to be set up. Past the unrelenting crime and hellish neighbours was the cold. These containers got COLD in the winter and the insulation was awful and the heaters were pathetic little ceramic tiles that did nothing. The electricity was on a meter system and I was spending at least �30 just being warm. Bare in mind most of these people got about 120 every two weeks from the job centre. The housing association did NOTHING for about a year, when they finally implemented wooden insulation.I had a meeting with Caroline Lucas (MP of Brighton) personally in a food bank I would vistit and she was sympathetic but there was little she could do to help. A few residents practically declared war on BHT, and rightly so. They had ruined our lives and now where ignoring our cries for help, because of they did acknowledge the huge failure that the project was they would probably be shut down. I went to numerous newspapers whom ignored me as they were told they were not allowed to publish our stories. The only one which was actually published was only a few weeks after we moved in and was by my neighbourBy this point I was struggling badly with mental illness again. I was depressed and highly angst with daily panic attacks. It didn't help that the ventilation system was also poorly designed and I receive all of the drug fumes that come form the bottom 5 floors (I'm at the top). This included 'Spice' (now banned in the UK) smoke and I went to hospital frequently with chest pains. ��These fumes filled my flat all day long, so I spent a lot of time walking out of the house.This last year is when the hell occurred.��Someone moved in next door with severe anger issues. He would break the the flat into little pieces and blast his meter high speakers all day and night filed on speed and weed. I would wake up suddenly in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding, panicking due to sudden slams or smashes against my wall. There is barely any space between the walls. I began to have sleeping problems and insomnia that started worsening everything else. Complaints were made to no avail, they tried to evict him bit it didn't work and was a lengthy procedure.He wasn't the problem though, his visitor was. He was another tenant in the project and one that has caused problems before. What started out with a bit of neighbourly chatter tuned out to be the worst mistake of my life. I invited his the other neighbour in to play some video games and while we got along, I stopped inviting him in after it became apparent that he was an absolutely despicable human being. He recently had threatened to beat up a girl that I had to stop and was known to be causing issues, making people feel bad, but wasn't a major problem around the block. It became clear to me that this man was a secret demon. He began knocking door hard in the morning and after ignoring him for weeks I would eventually answer and tell him I don't want to see him. He would take this as an oppurtunity for an argument and harass me further. He deluded himself into thinking we were friends and became aggressive when I poiletly told him and Sinhalese to him that we were not. He thought he could do whatever around and in my flat. He stated trying my handle daily, sometimes even without knocking and this went on for months and months and months. I asked him to stop but he wouldn't. I told him my anxiety and insomnia was getting so bad due him and my other birth our that I am going insane. He carried on trying my handle and door daily, sometimes for hours on end. This was the worst. I shouted at him told him to leave numerous times but it carried on. If you have ever had someone debase you on such a level you will know how damaging that is. Someone who dictated when you sleep or wake and knows there is nothing you can do about it because they have nothing to lose and you do. I couldn't fight him because he would probably take it further. The sound of handles going stated to evoke a horrible physical response, one which would affect me for weeks on end.I couldn't call the police because that would put me in a dangerous situation for being a 'snitch'. There was no point in telling my housing association, there is nothing they could have done that wouldn't put me in a worse situation. Along with an already desperate situation and a very loud neighbour and another who took it upon himself to make my life a living hell I began to get seriously physically ill.
��
The present day:I began suffering with horrible fevers and viruses, symptoms that can only be described as like having the flu for months and months last year and they haven't stopped. I had about 10 bloods taken over the course of the year and the doctors can't figure out why I'm the state I am in. When I talk about this I can't stress enough how much I don't mean this lightly. I have had the Nora virus while withdrawing from diazepam and that didn't touch the physical suffering I have had EVERY day for the past year. Raised cortisol and adrenaline have left me incapacitated and completely ravaged my body, I know all of this stress is to blame. Coupled with dreadful hypervigilance and severe insomnia the suffering had been something I wouldn't wish on the most evil person. I began to lost my mind and become so derealised and depresonalized that I don't know how to concentrate or relax. I cant do anything I live like play instruments or listen to music without the content dear that someone might hear and start harassing me. The insomnia has been so bad I have been nearing hospitalization and the only reason I'm here today is that I managed to escape for a few months back to a friend in Gloucestershire. I have wanted to commit suicide for such a long time, but I never will because of how much it would hurt certain family members, even though I do not have contact with them often. Just to be clear, I DONT take alcohol or drugs and haven't for a long while. I eat a very healthy diet and exercise (force myself) daily and practice standing medidtation (pretty much impossible with the though of him being around)For the last 3 months the loud neighbour has been evicted, but the other one (the real problem) is still around. Every time I enter the gate is like the walk of the gauntlet, whether I will see him (he is often around) and have to deal with him. Having gone to my friends house in Gloucestershire I got back to find out I couldn't get back in because someone had tried to break in and snapped something in my lock. I am completely aggrophobic. I never see anyone than people at the supermarket and when I enter the gate I practically run up to my flat, stuff the curtains with cloths (so they can't see the lights when I have them on a night) and make barely any noise at night.��Someone else has moved in and the evil man has started going into his flat talking to him. I can't believe that that after a horribly loud neighbour who attached the evil man I'm the first place has now been evicted, the next one is also inviting him up and will probably soon give the man a reason to start knocking me again under the guise of friendship. I know he is around because I hear him shouting laughing outside my flat and I know he has knocked me once or twice in the last week.Just after Christmas, I did everything I could to move to a different county. I found the only place that I had a possibility of moving to was Bournemouth and an agency called DWP housing, due to their low fees and no deposit. I got a citizen's card and went there took the form in and they accepted my referencing. I was invited to view a flat when I received a call from the wan I was dealing with saying they wouldn't be corresponding with me any further. I found out that my housing association had been talking with her and told her I was in rent arrears, which I was not. I was in water debt and service charge with confused her. But she didn't ask me before sending the emails and ruined my chances.��
I have been to the council, the waiting list is unbelievably long, even with medical needs. Everywhere else I have been wants �1200+ in fees/deposit which I currently have no way of saving. Because of living in a hostel (even though I am 25) I am now entitled to the one bed rate of any country, unless I move into shared, in which case that privilege will be revoked.At this point I don't care where I go, I would happily take anywhere else in the country, whether it be a hostel or otherwise.��Every day is a battle to keeping on going and I have no one sleds to talk to.That's was what I wrote a while ago in a forum dealing with neighbours.Following the containers, I was able to get a loan and finally move out of them for good. I move to another part of the country, completely on my own, didn't know anyone at all.I since have developed a depersonlization disorder following the end of the containers. I became so detached, I may have walked on separate occasions for 20 odd miles a day for months. It occurred one night last Christmas when I returned from a visit to my family's house. It's an absolute miracle that I was able to leave, and I was so optimistic that I began doing everything in my power to make myself well. I eat a perfect diet, I exercise daily and do everything I can.The chronic insomnia stayed and the dissociative symptoms have reached a point where my awareness levels are very worrying and borderline insane. I spend whole days trying to take on various stimulus took regain awareness. I try to take in sounds a sights, but everything has lost meaning. I can't appreciate a beautiful lake or a song, because I'm not here or there, I'm nowhere. I feel like some sort of  blood supply has been cut to important regions of my mind that I can only beg for help about.The fevers randomly come and go, even away from the containers and most days I wake up feeling physically awful. I cannot control my body temperature and wake up, I feel flu like again and again, which is how it began before.My muscles ache unbearably all day, I have to walk slow and when I exercise I do it out of fear of death.My body is simply fucked and no doctor can explain it. I clearly have something wrong but it can't be explained, probably because it is so complex or a virus so deep, it can't even be found. I have had over 20 blood tests in the last year. Around two weeks ago I developed a very loud tuning in my ears. It is severe tinnitus that is making everything I do meaningless. The last thing that I had in the world after moving was peace and quiet at night and that had been taken from me. There is no sight of it going and it didn't follow acoustic trauma. I can see myself rapidly declining in the past few weeks. This is becoming a joke. I have begun to think that this is some sort of test. I am being referred to a new psychiatrist,a sleep clinic and the community psychiatric team in my area and hopefully a neurologist.I now have no friends and speak to family maybe once a month.I exist only because I don't want to hurt those who may feel pain from my death. I love my 97 year old grandmother too much to burden her in her last year's and my mother would be distraught.I am approaching a stage where my suffering is so great, that there would have been numerous times that if I'd had access to a gun, I would definitely would have killed myself. The fear of drowning, hanging or falling is great.I want to die, I want others to accept that I want to die. I have been looking into possible euthanasia. I am close to the end.If you have read that all, I thank you that is all I ask."
I wish I was never born,"I've never been good at anything and doubt I ever will be. Always living in the shadows of smart, talented, beautiful people who actually have a future. Sometimes I hate them, most of the time I just hate myself. Out of everyone I knew I'm the biggest loser of them all. Everything is always about money and sex and it's bullshit. I'm just some dirty poor, how dare I have opinions, hopes or aspirations. I can never have independence and I feel like I've been set up to fail. Someone like me doesn't deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else. I wish I could give my worthless life to someone who belongs. I hope I find the courage to finally end my pathetic life."
What happens if I check myself in to a mental health facility?,"I need help. My thoughts are getting worse and worse. But I don't know what will happen with my wife and kids. Will my kids be taken away if CPS finds out I went to a facility? I want to get help, but don't want my kids taken away from my wife while I'm getting it.EDIT: I should clarify... my wife and kids aren't in any danger. My thoughts only relate to myself. I would never hurt my wife or kids."
I'm writing my suicide note right now. I plan to kill myself soon. I don't know what else to do.,"For the last few years, I've been struggling really hard. Plainly and simply, I hate absolutely everything I am. I've lost all my energy and drive and I don't care about anything I used to. I'm supposed to be a senior in college this year, but I got expelled this past year because I didn't care enough to go to any of my classes. To pay my bills now, I work full time on 3rd shift and I hate my job. To stay awake on the job, I take caffeine pills and they give me really bad anxiety. And the work is really draining, so I spend all of my free time sleeping. None of my friends want to hang out with me anymore because I'm such a piece of shit and I cancel plans all the time to sleep. I used to love to play jazz guitar and I don't have any time or energy to play anymore. My apartment is a complete mess, and I don't care enough to clean it. I can't fucking live like this anymore. I hate knowing how much of a fuck-up and a failure I am. I pissed my future away, so now I have to do something about it. I plan to kill myself sometime this month, if not as early as next week. I plan to take Tylenol PM and alcohol. I'll get drunk off my ass first, and then 16 pills should be enough to kill me from acetaminophen overdose. I have all the shit for it in my apartment already. I've been thinking about this for the past year or so and I've weighed all of my options. I know this is the right move. I thought about all the people who know me and I've wondered if any of them would miss me. I don't think they will. I know they won't. At least not in the long term. I'm just another failure that will fade into obscurity with time. It's better to off myself now than to keep burdening the world with my existence. I've come to realize that some people in this world just aren't cut out to play the game of life."
losing hope,"I'm 23 years old living with my mom and over 2k in debt from medical bills. I've been healthy all my life until I was 22 when I was diagnosed with a fungal infection. Some call it a candida overgrowth and it's been haunting me since January. Everyday has been a struggle with feeling tired and this brain fog 24/7. I'm starting to get answers to cures but all the ""cures"" have potential of causing other serious health issues. I don't enjoy activities like I used to and I'm starting to lose my friends because it seems like I'm pushing them away but in reality I just can't find the energy to hang out with them. I've been having suicidal thoughts often for about 3 or 4 months now because i'm tired of the suffering. On top of this I was raised by a sociopath and suffered a lot in my childhood and my biggest fear is becoming like my insane dad. This brain fog i've been suffering from feels like it's making me lose my mind and making me feel more open to putting a stop to my life. If anyone knows a natural cure to candida overgrowth please let me know as I won't be able to afford many more doctor visits. I'm not looking for sympathy or ""I can relate"" replies I just want answers :("
Contemplating suicide,Contemplating suicide every night is not how I want to live. Don't know how to fix it. I hate myself.
can i just die :(,"i want to get out of this world i have no friends no family who cares about me and worst of all i just cant to live any more i just want to go hang myself :,("
Need help,"Forbthe paste year, my life has been a blur. I have had no interests except video games. Video games have been the only thing stopping me from suicide. I dont have any friends, i am overweight and my parents are the biggest problem. They are always putting me down, they call me a loser, a failure, pathetic, a disappointment, a dumbass, lazy, every day. Today my mum took away my computer with all my games, she said go get a life you loser. Videogame have Been the thing keeping me together for so long. Now that they are gone, i think i am going to do it"
Just can't anymore,"I'm lying in dorm, not wanting to get out of bed for my classes. Can't even eat at all anymore and the pain in my stomach wont go away. My grades are terrible and my tutors cant even help me. I don't want exsit on this planet anymore. My boyfriend doesn't seem to care about me anymore, but claims he still does. It's fine though I deserve all of this. All I wanted to do was to just be happy. And I was but now I'm not... so what is the point anymore everything is failing around me and I want to quit. I hate my life and don't care about it anymore, I just think everyone would be happier if I was gone. I have no energy to do anything. I have no fight left in me, and gonna take some pills tonight. Hopefully I dont wake up......"
"That's it, i've had enough","Don't even try. See you later, world."
Don�۪t know why I�۪m even posting this.,"I don�۪t know if this will even help. I don�۪t even know why I�۪m thinking about coming to Reddit with this. I�۪ve been very open about this stuff, and I think that has helped me, so here we go.  I�۪ve been super stressed (but I don�۪t want to sound whiney). I think it�۪s just time. I don�۪t ever see myself coming out of this funk. When I try to talk to friends/family/my Dr. they all just get mad. I�۪m on vacation from work this week, so maybe I�۪ll just enjoy it, and enjoy my plans with my friends and family and just end it on the last day. That�۪s just my current thoughts. Maybe sharing this will help me in some way. Who knows?  Just wanted to get that out there. "
"Friend has given up, seriously considering suicide","I have a friend who has given up. She's been in abusive relationships, self-harmed, had serious body issues her whole life. A few months ago she was spiked and raped.
She is seeing a therapist for the rape but they don't know the full extent of her feelings, she thinks if she tells someone they'll lock her up or make her quit her job, tell her family or maybe worse do nothing at all.
She doesn't want help, she doesn't want me to help because she doesn't see any reason to keep on living.
I'm really scared, I'm trying fucking everything on google but she's so set on giving up I don't know what to do. I've told her I'm here to listen but she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to burden me. I just really need some help on what to do.
To make things worse I now live 3 hours away so I cant help her in person.
Any advice would be so endlessly appreciated, thanks"
Will anyone give a shit if I just... do it?,"Like, I have nobody."
I've lost all my potential. I ruined my own life,"Freshman year of high school I was on track to being valedictorian. I could have gone to an Ivy league school, I had such a bright future ahead of me. Of course I fucked all that up. I went to UCR because it was the only ""good"" college that accepted me. I had no idea that I could go to a cc and transfer to UCLA, I didn't even know that was an option. My GPA sucks, my social life is nonexistent, this is the rest of my life now. Everyone has moved on without me. I'm a disappointment to my family and everyone I know. This isn't the life I wanted. It's too late to be someone great, to accomplish all of my goals. I had so much potential. I was a ""smart"" kid. I don't want an ordinary life. What's therapy going to do? Help me cope and make me settle? I don't want to live this life anymore. I've wanted to die for years. Lol I procrastinated on homework and suicide it looks like. I don't know what I'm waiting for. I'm never going to have the life I dreamed for myself. I'm such a nothing."
Anyone in a situation similar to mine?,"19 y/o male in college, struggling in school, poor mental condition overall, fully lonely (not in physical state, but in state of mind), awful luck with the opposite sex, nothing that genuinely makes you happy, bleak outlook on the future.i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school, is anyone like that on here?"
Doing it to stop hurting others,"I have an anger issue, and a carelessness issue. Usually I can keep both of them in check, but there's been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work. I keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people I run into. I hate living in the city, everyone is so fake and out for themselves. I fear that one day I will lose control on another, so maybe it's just best to take care of myself first."
Lost and Hopeless,"At what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option? I've had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now, but I never really considered actually doing it until quite recently. I'm so far down the drain that I don't think it's humanly possible to obtain the life I want, a somewhat normal life, anymore.I'm a 23 year old guy with avoidant personality disorder who doesn't have any friends, never worked a job, and never had any sort of relationship with anyone. On top of that, I just failed college for the second time in 5 years because I'm too depressed and anxious to deal with handling the work and being around people all day. I have absolutely no skills or anything to offer to any individuals or society. I just play video games and listen to music all day because that's the only thing that doesn't cause me anxiety.I hate myself and I hate the fact that I hate myself. I can see the innate beauty in every other person on this planet except for myself. A lot of people feel and act the way I do and I wouldn't call them worthless, so why must I do so when it comes to me? I feel this hollow yet dense pain in my chest that won't go away. The pain comes from the realization that I am completely and utterly worthless, and nothing will ever change that because I was born with the wrong genes and made stupid decisions my entire life.Medications, therapies, and ""getting out there"" haven't helped in the slightest. In all honesty, I'm worse off for having tried them because I used to have hope that there was something out there that could help me. Failing over and over again has crushed my soul to the point of no return. I'm starting yet another CBT program in a few weeks, one which is way out of my price range and will leave me in moderate debt, and I can't help but feel that this is my final hope. I can't keep doing this crap anymore. I'm either going to get better soon, or I'm going to die, there will not be an in-between anymore."
Before I died I need to tell my story,"This is my life, It's a long sad story but one I must tell to someone. I was born a middle kid into a middle class family. My parents we're my first abusers. My Dad was an alcoholic. He beat me and my brother. Some nights were good and he just listen to music. My mom was not much better. She was abuse by my dad but she abuse him emotionally and financially. They were bad for each other.  Around the third grade I was diagnosed with autism. The testing was very traumatic. This was when I first experience gender dysphoria. In the waiting room the only VHS that worked was Alice in Wonderland. I wanted to be Alice. She could handle her new world and I couldn't handle mine. My parent just filled me with pills from than till high school. The pill made me slow and fat. It was easier to dope me up than to be a parent. This lead to me getting up to 400 LBS and I develop boob. (I'm a guy) I've spent my whole adult life trying to get fit because of this. It's one of my biggest failures. At 17 I was raped. My friends got me drunk and payed a girl to have sex with me. It happen at a party. I've only told my therapist. I still can't talk about. There's no proof left too, so one one would believe me. Collage was a failure to. I didn't know I had BPD and depression. I still didn't talk about being rape. I let it build up inside me. I than met my Ex. She was great at first than became emotionally,verbally, and sexually abusive. I hide her from friends and family. I spend the next three years in deep denial. This come out in a phone sex and cam girl addiction. It'd been a year and I can't stop. I've spend $10,000.  There's no coming back from all this. I'm stuck at a dead end job. My life is forfeit. There's no coming back from all this."
"They're not just upset with me, they're scared of me",Two of them are scared of how'd I'd react to what they would say and one of them was hesitant on telling the counselor.And this other girl... she's afraid that I'm some sort of stalker or molester. She was thinking about being friends again but I kept messaging her asking to be friends again when she didn't want to talk.It was hard accepting that they may not want to be friends again but I thought they realised that I had changed but this... I just don't know what to do
i fucked up,"i accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends. i was in a terrie headspace and i went to go kiss her; she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in. the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her, but i kept going. oh god, i wish i didn�۪t keep going. i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt. i realized what i had done and left, profusely apologizing.she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that, but i can�۪t grt rid of the guilt. i feel like everyone hates me now (with due reason) and i�۪ve been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself. i never have enough energy to carry it out, but im thoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldn�۪t stop it. yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck, constricting airflow very momentarily, and something in my mind just told me to keep going. i felt so at peace. i�۪m so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me because im absolutely fucking horrendousi�۪ve been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myselfi think suicide has been a long time coming. i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster. maybe i�۪ll be at peace. maybe she�۪ll be at peace too. she won�۪t see me walking around anymore. she�۪ll be comfortable. i want her to be comfortable. i just want her to be fucking happy. she deserves the whole world. she deserves the sun, the moon, and the stars. she doesn�۪t deserve the pain i caused her. so maybe if i don�۪t exist anymore, her pain will go away too."
Sorry In Advance,"I'm probably going to kill myself on my birthday. I'm 17 so I will be 18 if or really when I do it . Most people will say that I'm too young . It's most likely 20% of my life. And legitimately that's enough for me to get a good idea about my future . And I say that because I don't think I can change that much unless I'm under extreme circumstances. And to me this isn't even extreme . I've been coming to this realization more and more lately. And It isn't because of people around me . The people around me have been great for the most part . My family has its faults and I've met some mean people . But everyone does . The outlier for my happiness is me . I make all of my problems. More like I am all of my worst problems. And I've been trying to fix myself for a long time . Therapy , medication, exercise, healthy diet etc etc. I still hate myself more than most political parties hate each other . I'm the problem and I've owned up to it. I'm still giving myself time , I'm putting it off . But my birthday is the cutoff date. January 11th . And I think now I'm serious . I've written posts like this before . But then I'd be angry , sobbing , desperate , or some other emotion . Nothing now . Just numb . Seriousness . Used to care if I was coherent writing these things but I'm probably not . This paragraph has no flow I just don't cafe anymore . I'm writing to write and to reach out one more time . I want to be able to try anything . Fair warning for anyone to comment , I'm too stubborn for my own good . I'm going to argue my point with the logic that I've created for myself that pushes me to fail . Or maybe not i don't even know right now considering that I feel different . Either way , be ready for that .
For the first time in years I can't fucking wait for my birthday . "
Why should I get help if I don't want it?,"I've struggled with the idea of being alive, and wanting to be alive for a while now. I recently realized that I don't want help. I just want to not be alive. The only reason I would seek help is so that I don't hurt my loved ones. I've attempted to kill myself before, but I can't even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if I actually did it. I don't want them to ever feel how I've felt, but I just don't think that they understand how I feel. Even when I'm not feeling as depressed, the thought of not being alive is  so appealing. I've always done only what others expect of me, but I've never really wanted more for my life anyway. I've tried therapy, a few medications, none of it has been right for me. If they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive, maybe they wouldn't be so insistent on me trying to get help. I just can't wait for a medication or therapy to work, that could take months or years. Every single day, every hour, every minute is so painful, I just can't do it anymore."
I don't see a point to anything anymore...,I'm consumed by my loneliness and emotional pain although I know many others have had it worse. I have BPD. I realize it's pathetic. I can't focus on anything anymore; nothing makes me happy. I'm 28 and have been like this since at least the age of 9. Nothing gets better. I'm really nearing the end because I can't do this anymore. I don't have the capacity to connect with anyone. No work I do has any meaning. I can't gell the pieces of myself together. I can't keep living like this anymore.
I don�۪t know about this anymore,As I took my walk tonight I reflexed on my past I have been struggling with some depression recently so iv been stuck in my head I have found life hard to live with out purpose I�۪m a 26M iv been in two serious relationships and I always seem to push them away with my insecurities all I wanted in life was a family but I feel it was not meant for me I can�۪t take it any longer I unfortunately own a few guns and I spend most nights staring at them drinking until I pass out I feel it�۪s only a matter of time till I man up and do something about it I�۪m hundreds of miles from any friends or family and I�۪m alone all I have is this sad music and my guns I just want to be loved wanted anyways bye
"This is incredibly frustrating, I'm afraid of going to school tomorrow because I shaved, and should I ditch school due to what happened between my parents or nah? I have a lot in my mind I just don't know what to do anymore.(long post)","Hello, so I have commented here as I am a shy/anxious junior in high school with social anxiety, so like I got rid of the crap on my face. I'm worried if others will say, like I did last year and this white girl named Emma said and yelled""Holy shit you shaved!"" and everyone was looking at me. I don't want anyone to find out I shaved, and I unwanted facial hair I have bits of it, I don't want it to fucking grow, I hate how I look, I didn't ask for this shit on my face. Just because I'm ""growing up"" doesn't mean I want it, and a lot of people my age don't have this crap. They're gonna be like ""you look different."" I get so nervous because of that. How do I stop this fucking growth? It's insane, my dad told me to shave once every week to prevent the hair from growing. I want it to stop, so I can stop it makes me uncomfortable, I literally don't want this, please. I'm a south asian-Pakstani. I got into a huge feud with my parents and i cried a lot and my mom said"" people who cry are like 4 year old kids like your cousin yunus"" ""you put all the stress on yourself, and it is your fault"" i told her to respect my boundaries, and ill respect yours i shaved and so she got mad and said ""don't hide your blanket"" i was going to put it away anyways downstairs but i told her about my self harming problem and how you told me i ""joke about suicide"" and other past stuff she assumed i was ""joking about"" and she said ""i'm sorry i didn't realize that, i don't know what i said suicide is a joke, and you're not alone i used to have suicidal thoughts myself"" i cut myself so hard because i was sad i'm sorry i broke it i suck ass and anyhoo, when i was driving she told me that"" she got fired from her davis job, and she's been trying to find a job for 7 years, and i do care about you, i tell you about religion because it helps me, and allah will help everyone and everyone will go back to him, i believed in allah"" ""allah knows our strengths and weaknesses, and please don't suffocate yourself with a pillow, i put the blame on you because you want it to be, i'm not giving you pity, attention"" i'm fucking tired man i was screaming/crying at her and my dad came in the closest and told my mom to ""leave me alone let him calm down"" i said i ""ruined things, and clearly you guys don't love me and care about me, i self harm(shows my cuts) and i tried to suffocate myself with a pillow, i feel like this is all my fault and i'm alone"" she got all shocked i told her i might plan to go to ditch school tomorrow or at least a few days and she told me ""not to, have faith in allah he will help you"" i told her"" i don't believe in god, and i hate religion"" and she said ""i used to think that too, and when i had faith in allah he helped solve my problem while allah did have let out the bad devil, he does good and you know how you write in a journal on about how stressed you are? you should do it"" I am planning to tell her I want to talk to my school psychologist, but she keeps suggesting me Muslim male and female counselors though saying female Muslim would be better. She said ""regular psychologists aren't going to be as helpful, it takes time to get them because you need a referral."" But, what if I do the school one?"
I can't carry on,"Every day everything becomes more and more difficult. Every night I lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head, all the thoughts are so disjointed, unclear, as if I can't think properly. The only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming. Every night I resolve to kill myself in the morning. Then it's morning. It's not that having slept on it things are better, it's more that I've come down from being past the point of being able to cope to just on the edge of my capability to cope. I go through my awful day, it's evening again and the whole process starts againOne day sooner or later, I feel like sooner, I won't wake up like that. I'll wake up still committed to the idea of killing myself. I cannot remember ever being happy or even just okay. I'm 25 now and I can remember crushing unhappiness going back at least to when I was 15. When I was in school I could look to the idea of 'I'll go to university and things will be different, I'll meet new friends, it'll be a new start'. When I was at university and that obviously didn't work out I could think the same about finishing university. Now though there is next stage to look forward to and even if there was I know it'd end up being no better.  Life now is deciding to kill myself in the evenings, deciding against that in the mornings until one day I don't. I have nothing good in my life. I have no real friends (and no clue on how to make them), I've never had a meaningful relationship (It's quite difficult letting people close when like this), even my family don't like me that much (the feeling is mutual). Sure I've got a job, but the thought of going to my workplace every day makes me feel physically ill and it's a dead end job that's going nowhere. What is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live? I might as well give up now"
"I want to so bad, but I just can't bring myself to actually do it",Why do you want to die?
I can't do it anymore,I just lost the last person I care about. I'm done. The pain is to much now.
Pointless,"Hello world,My name will be kept anonymous. I'm 13, and I'm fucking done with life. I've tried it out, got bored, wanna move on to the next thing. Death. I only have three friends, including my mother. My father is dead. Everyone at school dislikes me, and I couldn't care less if they did or not.I'm not here to say I will. I'm here to say I might. So please, gimme some words, Reddit.God knows my therapist can't."
Fuck I Want To Die,"I guess I just wanted to date in high school, or at least before 22. I've always been a hopeless romantic guy (emphasis on the hopeless) and I've always went way overboard when it came to getting crushes and naturally, I've scared everyone I ever had a chance with off long before I did anything like dating them. Now I'm 80 pounds overweight and depressed and anyone I find attractive is way out of my league at this point. That's probably my fault too though, I could date a girl I find unattractive but would that be fair to either of us? I'd rather rot to be honest. Not to mention I have no idea how to talk to women, I'm worse than the classic nerd paraded on television (ironically one I used to call over exaggerated haha...) and I stumble, fail to make eye contact, and forget what I'm saying constantly even when I have no romantic intentions. I'm pathetic I guess, and one way or the other life has helped me fuck myself so I guess I won't die a virgin after all. After 1 near attempt earlier this year I think I'm ready, hopefully I won't pussy out this time and actually get the gun. The problem is if I get the gun and don't go through I won't have enough money to live so I'm too poor to kill myself hahaha. I know this is a stupid reason to kill myself, and I do have others but I was just focusing on this one tonight in particular but it doesn't matter because I'll be dead either way if all goes according to plan. Sorry for those of you that read this mildly depressing rant, was just looking for a place to fulfill my narcissism."
"I don't want to write a note, but I want to talk with somebody. I don't want to go out all by myself.","I don't know, maybe deep deep down I'm lonely and I really do want help. I don't know how to ask for help. As long as I can remember I've been completely non verbal about my problems, like I literally can't speak truthfully about it in real life, because I was so afraid of it being used to hurt me in some way.I feel very determined to die at this point, and I have a plan that I've practiced, but I don't want to be alone when I decide to carry out my plan. I know I can't write a note, but I do want to talk to somebody. It's just too hard to say anything to somebody who can see me and act upon me or who has met me."
Is it really worth it guys?,"I�۪m really fucking unhappy. I do take the effort to try and enjoy life, but it is just not happening. It�۪s just strife after hardship after tribulation, and I don�۪t reeeeally see the return in all the effort put into it. It�۪s just the logical thing to do for me; just kinda wanna play games that aren�۪t out yet or experience new music- those things are probably the only thing making me hesitate."
It's been real y'all (jk it's been terrible),"I am 27 and have tried everything to fix my brain. I have tried talk therapy, self help books, self help apps, eating healthy, exercise, sunlight, etc. yet I never feel better and always feel a darkness around me that never goes away. I am unattractive, shy and have no friends and wasted my entire life. I cannot accomplish anuthing, all I've ever wanted to do was photography and went to school for art but I suck at it and now am stuck in retail. Everyone in life has moved on and i am thinking of just ending everything. "
Dont know how much longer I can take this...,"Hello! Im going to apologize in advance for any errors in what i'm about to type.I am 15 years old, in Highschool. Ive been depressed for over a year now, and nothing has helped me long term. The only person who cares about me wont even speak to me anymore. She would always be there for me whenever she noticed I was sad, and I basically humiliated myself when I told her that I loved her.She told me that im not her type, and I respected that and I moved on, we continued to be friends, but she started to purposefully make me feel a certain way when she didnt want to deal with me. She would usually just either do something that would make me feel guilty, or just avoid me and say that its for the better. But she would always apologize right after she did it, and tell me that she was sorry for doing this to me. She told me that she didnt mean to do this to me, and that shell feel at fault if I ever kill myself. I told her that I forgive her, and that all she has to do is be normal around me and she wont have to worry about hurting me. Months of me slowly losing everything I know and love passed, we both went to highschool, and over the summer I adopted the habit of cutting myself. It was the only way I could cope without anyone to talk to. My mother found out after 1 whole month of me cutting. She didnt offer any support, she just told me to stop because it would ruin her image. I didnt stop. After 1 week I messaged my friend about what im going through. She sent me an email in the first week of school telling me that she doesnt want to help me anymore, and that I need therapy. Ever since then, she wont even aknowledge that I exist. I have tried to ask her if we could talk things through, no reply. I sit at her table with the rest of my friends every day, everyone just acts like I dont exist. I have literally cried before and not one person asked if I was okay. Sometimes, one of my ""friends"" will make a ""joke"" along the lines of ""Why are white people so bipolar""- then he says some other crap that I will not repeat. (Yes, I am white, and besides 2 other people at my table, everyone is asian.) Its obvious that they are talking about me. They make fun of me a lot, its screwed up though because I have known them for all of middle school and some of highschool. Yet they act like im just some piece of trash.Though I said my friend acts like I dont exist, she will say hi to me everyone now and then, or sometimes she will ask how I am doing in school, all adding to my confusion. She is honestly the only reason I want to live, yet she is slowly just trying to forget me. But she is not judgemental of me, like everyone else is. That is why I still hold on to her. Well enough of my life story. Im honestly just planning on killing myself soon, its all just become too much to handle... I have attempted suicide before, but I ended up thinking of my friend and stopping because I wouldnt want to hurt the person who means so much to me. I told myself that if she doesnt respond to me in a week, then that means she doesnt care about me. Then, I will have nothing holding me back. I have already written everyone a suicide note, and its all readly available to be sent with a click of a button. Im just ready to die.  I know I sound pretty pathetic, but tell me what I havent already heard before by every single person I used to be close to.Well, goodbye everyone! It may be today, or tomorrow or the end of the week. But when ever I do it, I want to thank anyone who truely cares.(Sorry for so much reading.)"
Goodbye,"Everyone I ever trusted has forgotten me, no one cares, goodbye everyone, ill be gone in 6 hours and 35 minutes"
"After nearly giving in, I've made myself a promise.","Last week I drove out to a local suspension bridge. It's in the middle of a park which is closed for the season, and doesn't receive a lot of traffic. The bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below, which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity, allowing a quick and certain death. As I looked down to the river below, I thought about just how many people have been where I am. How many of them could use just one person to just listen, not judge or tell them how to ""fix"" their lives. But just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out. Somebody that would just make them feel like their pain was legitimate, and not just a problem that could be easily solved. If only someone would just be there.As I started climbing over the railing, and hung with only my own trembling fingers separating me from a release from my own existential hell, I had another thought. I am someone. It made me pause and wonder, What if I could give others what I, myself could never find? Maybe I could do some good in the world after all. I'd have purpose. Meaning. I drove back to town and I promised myself that I would do just that. If I can't express my own misery, I can at least help others with theirs. If any of you want to talk, feel free to message me. I can't promise I can help, but I promise you I will listen, and do all I can to help you feel a little better."
My brain hurts and soul is sick,"My medications aren't helping, and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy. I grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure I could use it with the barrel against my head. Please say something to me. Anything. The anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up. I feel like my prayers aren't being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me."
I feel like the problem today is feeling real human connection. I think the internet has made it impossible now.,"Your observations are very correct. Shut off the phone or computer, go outside, get some fresh air, and meet some new people. "
I really tried,"I tried everything. I got a job, started a study programme and I work out regularly and eat healthy. I got over 80% of my anxiety and everything (except of love) is working out right now. But I still feel pain I almost cannot handle. And yes, it's physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury. I tried it all really. I went to therapy, medication, everything. I still relapse regularly. I cannot do this. I hope I have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow. I wont even write a suicide note cause I dont feel like it. I'm so fucked up..."
im done..,"I'm 17 and currently in college, this post will most likely look like a mess as I am not the best with this sort of stuff but oh well. I struggled through school with things such as concentrating,thinking,writing/getting thoughts out and I guess I have social anxiety but never been told that by a professional (only by a close friend) and I have been feeling like shit for at least 2 years now and it is getting to the point of where I don't know what to do now.When was in school (Primary/secondary) they had never contacted my parents about that nor did they actually properly help me but they did put me in all the lowest classes and I would get more help near exams and go into different rooms.. But they never asked for me to be tested for anything like learning difficulties or such so I've just had to deal with feeling stupid and it feels like my fault but oh well I guess. Each week is like a loop that I am stuck in and it just goes on and on and it feels so pointless. We all live to grow old and then die so what is the point of getting a job that will probably be shit for me because I'm not exactly the smartest person out there.Most days I wake up with the feeling of being tired but not like I need more sleep just the feeling of not wanting to move or where I just don't see the point and can't be arsed to do anything, I get the thoughts of being able to float away or disappear (I say that a lot to my close friend and it probably sounds so fucking stupid)I also get the thoughts of why do I get to bitch about how I am feeling so down but there are people who are going through so much worse than me because its all in my head and I need help but I want to end it all so bad but im too scared to fucking hang myself."
22[F] Currently failing at life & I want to kill myself...,"Growing up, I got bullied and teased. Ive always been the kid trying to be in the in crowd, trying to look cool, trying to be popular. I tried so hard that my best friend in elementary school doubled as my bully. (She wasn't my only bully) I never physically got it but man were those kids mean. I got bullied literally from 5 years old to college. Everywhere I go... it turns into some form of bullying. At work, my bosses.. or even coworkers. I once got into a physical altercation with my roommate because I wanted her to stop using my as a verbal punching bag.  I was an asshole too so don't feel too sorry for me. I once told my now friend that I heard screams in my head whenever I looked at her hair. I know, what the fuck is wrong with me right? This was like middle school. I bullied this one girl from elementary school to senior year of high school. We are now friends, I sincerely apologized after we graduated and never bullied her again. I am no longer a bully..I grew up my whole life thinking I'd be a rapper and when I got famous I'd say FUCK ALL YOU HOE ASS BULLIES, FUCK YOU!! Or maybe I'd forgive them and just motivate some other kids who got bullied. Idk, I wanted to be an inspiration and change the world. I wanted to be like Kanye West. My favorite rapper of all time. But even Kanye broke my fucking heart..he used to be for the black community and struggles and uplifting black people but all he cares about is money now and clothes and rich people bullshit. Im a fucking virgin. Im overweight. Im a 22 year old virgin and im a girl!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK.. I never even kissed a guy.. other than one time in 8th grade during truth or dare. ..until recently. I was on the train coming home from work and this guy asked if he could kiss me. I guess I looked rougly decent that day. He probably had low standards though bcuz he wasnt that great looking either. Anyway.. dude asks to kiss me and I say why the fuck not because YOLO right? I have NO friends... My phone broke recently and I realized that I didnt even need it because I dont need it... The only person who texts me is me is my younger sister who's 19.. I had a great best friend of 8 years. It would have been 9, but I treated her like utter shit and I touched her in her sleep. What kind of fucking asshole does that to someone??? To make matters worse, she's straight and had no feelings for me whatsoever. We talked about me liking her and her not liking me before I did it. I hate myself straight up. I apologized to my friend many times, she said she's not angry but she doesnt want to be friends anymore. I completely understand but I just hate myself for this shit now.. Its embarrassing, everything. Im tired of this life. I dropped out of college because Im bipolar and have ADD also.. so school is fucking hard and I flunked 5 semesters. I shouldve graduated by now but Im 2 years behind.. maybe more.Ive never been in a relationship.My mom had a talk with me last night and told me that nobody celebrates failure. And she was telling me why people dont like me. This may sound bad, but she was coming from a good place and out of concern, her tone may not translate because of the way Im writing it."
The sad part,No matter what I post here I know I'll feel like a fool for it ... I mean .... nothing will change . My life has always been this way. And being a guy it's not so easy to find someone to talk to about my feelings .  I just want a change in my life . Or I'm ending it in a year from now
I just want it to be over.,"Hometown friends have given up even replying to me now.The last thing I was told was ""Complaining won't get you anywhere.""
(context: ""family"" money issues, but I can't do anything about it and I'm not allowed to get a job.)
I look like a bum compared to an average kid at my school, people keep talking shit about me more and more, yet a family member can drop +$800 on a phone like it's nothing. I know I keep sounding like a dick here but my school bag is falling apart, my shoes I have to wear everyday are falling apart, and my 2 pairs of jeans are ripped. (probs. because I'm a fatass, but whatever.)I already think people are talking shit about me, but when they actually say it to my face...All of this is out of my control. I can't do shit about it.I can't imagine waiting all this out until next year. I've been waiting so long for a little ounce of hope but nothing has happened for so long, what's the point?..
(sorry for being annoying, i just want to talk to someone. also, please don't PM me, got some dude wanting to take me away and shit.) "
The Light is Going Out,"The lights are going out.I�۪ve lived with depression and anxiety for 4 years now. My first ���public�۪ panic attack I had was my sophomore year of college. My girlfriend was hanging out in my room as I started bawling on the phone with my parents. That was the first time anyone had seen me cry in years, seen really any emotion out of me. I started to get nihilistic when I went into college. I started to see the world, as I put it, realistically, or what I thought was realistic. I started seeing the world as I wanted to see it, as a shithole. Pointless. A waste of my time and effort. That�۪s when I started to question ���why?�۝ As a junior in college I still struggle to find that Why in my life, that purpose everyone else seems to have, the drive that gets them out of bed in the morning, that will to live. I just don�۪t think I have it anymore. Sure, I�۪ve gotten help and have seen a multitude of doctors and specialists, but you can�۪t be honest with them. They see that will to live as the only way to keep your freedom. I can�۪t tell anyone I want to hurt myself or I want to jump off the balcony of a 15-story building or I�۪m going to get put away, locked up in a nice padded room and fed drugs so I don�۪t kill myself. That makes no sense. If I want to die, let me die. I just don�۪t see the point in it all anymore, going to classes is a struggle in the morning, I even have a hard time going out to get drunk and do drugs. I don�۪t have the motivation to get fucked up as a 20-year-old guy. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can�۪t I look myself in the mirror anymore? Why can�۪t I just be a normal guy? What is broken in my head?"
I did something not good and I wanna end it,Can i pm someone
I don't want to die but that's where things seem to be heading.,"I don't want to die. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave all of the people I care about behind. But I feel like that's where I'm headed. It's that same feeling when you wake up in the morning and the bed is nice and comfy. Maybe you are even a bit sick. You tell yourself ""I don't want to get up. I don't want to go to class. I don't want to go to work."" But no matter how many times you tell yourself this, you know that you are eventually going to get up and do what needs to be done.I feel like that right now. Part of me has taken it as an inevitability and is waiting for the time. I find myself making lose plans. Part of me is fighting back, trying to throw up as many safeguards as I can.  When the suicidal part is in control, I find myself slipping in messages of ""help me"" into conversations, but nobody ever listens and nobody comes to help. When my rational mind is in control, I find myself unconsciously making small preparations.This war in my head is really tearing me apart. I can't do anything at times, I just lie/sit there or mechanically go through whatever needs to happen. We had a big career fair at my school this week and I couldn't even manage to go there because the depression hit so hard, even though I know that I need to go because I need to get a job for the next summer. If I even make it to next summer.  I'm not making a positive change in the world and my existence only hurts people. Any good I do like with the guy from last week I just feel like I'm attoning for the terrible things that I've done. but I know that some things about me won't and can't change, so I know I will hurt people in the future.I'm writing this as someone with some sense of control right now. I know that all of these thoughts, including the suicidal ones, are mine. It is me and I am it. I just don't know how much longer I get to be myself. "
Probs gonna end it on my birthday tomorrow,"Im gonna turn 24 tomorrow, and I feel like im a waste of time and resources for my parents and society. In my 24 years ive contributed absolutley nothing to anyone or done anything that brings value to anyone. Everyday despite how hard it is for me to gather my myself to get up out of bed, i do it for my parents because I dont want to disappoint them any further and I try, but everynight i get home a failure. All my peers and collegues are amazing and moving up in the world, have careers, finished uni, have partners and are loving life and everyday im going downhill, failing university, not performing well at work and im my social life.Before when people used to ask me what i want to do in 5 years time, I responded with some optomistic bullshit where I would run my own business or some shit but now if anyone ask me, I cant even see past the next day let alone 5 years.I know I have amazing family, and I have a number of good friends and thats the only reason I keep getting up in the morning to try again. But if i was to describe myself i would say I am useless, worthless, unmotivated, lazy and a terrible person but most of all just downright pathetic. Looking at everything rationally im really lucky and privledged to have so many blessings and i feel so guilty like an overwhelming sense of guilt. I read though other peoples post and im amazed at how strong some people are. Im sorry that i cant be as strong as them.Back in primary school im grade 5 people used beat me up, throw rocks and shit and a lot of other shit and i remember holding knife to my throat in the kitchen fuck i wish that i just ended it then. Most days I think about how I should kill myself and how make it look an accident which has minimum disruption to my friends and family. I think ive worked out a way, and ive written a note and now I think im writing this out hoping for a sign to stay. I dont want to die but it just hurts like Im constantly in pain and it hurts so bad. My heart has this constant sinking feeling and my left arm is just numb. I want to just make it stop please. Sorry for the stupid and selfish post. Idk feel free to ignore it or whatever."
Is there a point to life?,"I've always felt so ""out of place"". I'm not one of those cool kids that everyone loves, I'm that awkward kid that sits at his desk and doesn't do shit in fear of judgement. I'm so worried about what people think about me, it's overtaking my life. I can't do things I'm passionate about in fear of being ""weird"". On top of that I seem to have gotten everything shitty. I'm clumsy as fuck and god has that got me into so many situations. Not only that but I suffer from OCD. Other than that, I'm so fucking shy I can't talk in front of people. Getting called on in class makes my brain shut down, and forces me to seem like a dumbass. My family relationships are breaking apart, me feeling farther and farther away. I don't have people to talk to -- rather I'm to shy to talk to anyone about my problems. I don't give a shit about myself. I don't want to make other people deal with my problems, i dont want other people to care for me, or feel for me. If i get hurt i feel more embarrassed that i got myself hurt than trying to treat myself. I dont care anymore, so whats the point? I dont need a future, i wont matter, i dont need to matter. My life was a mistake and it should stay that way, right? I just want to end it all, no point in keeping on going because I don't have anything to go to. I dont have motivation, goals, anything. The only reason i keep going is because i dont want others to be hurt if i disappear, but what if they dont care? No one likes me, i dount they will care. I have a few friends, but to them im just a side friend. They wont care. My one best friend might care, but he can just replace me. Not like im original in anyway. I dont even know why im posting this. For pity? For hope that somehow i can stop this? I'm going to end it soon, is there a small part of me that doesnt want to? Why does life have to be so complicated. Atleast it will be over soon."
Help,"For a lot of complicated reasons, that are hard to describe because it's all due to cultural reasons , I am feeling the overwhelming urge to end it. I am stuck as the person inbetween my father and my fianc̩ fighting over cultural norms as I am marrying outside of my culture. She just refuses to understand that many of the constraints I have are due to my fathers occupation and role in our community. Any deviation from it, prior to marriage, could affect his livelyhood. And in addition, my mom is currently full disabled and incapable of working . She comes from a wealthy family and doesn't understand the need to think about her families financial future. My father is a clergyman. I feel lost, sad, stupid, hurt. My mom is in the hospital currently. My finance is right I front of me refusing to speak to me because I won't stand up for her culture, even though culturally it's supposed to be her parents. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like it would be easier to just drive into a wall. My father is constantly stressed and angry because I am marrying outside, my mother is in the hospital , my sister currently is upset with me because I chose to help my fianc̩ with somthing over my family. Everyone is upset with me right now, and I can't take this overbearing weight that is on my shoulders. It may seem trivial to those outside of my culture but it really does affect every part of my life. I just want to get rid of this feeling. "
I am going to kill myself,"The point of this text isn't to get someone to talk me out of it- it won't work. This is not a cry for help. I just thought I should tell somebody, and for obvious reasons I can't just text  someone I know and tell them that by the end of the week I plan on being dead. That's it."
I don't like people but I hate being alone,"The suicide hotline has me on hold so I want to post here. Basically I don't understand why this happens, but I hate being with people. I hate being alone more. So I'm always sad to varying degrees. I don't like hanging out with people right now cause I gained 25-ish lbs in the past 8 months. I have binge eating disorder. I went from 115 to 138 lbs and it is obvious on my 5'1 frame. I'm so embarrassed I can't look people in the eyes anymore. Not being able to keep my head up from the shame resulted in me losing my competitive job for not being able to perform anymore. I couldn't do projects or come up with ideas and I certainly couldn't pitch. I lost my soul, and now my dream. So I work a 9-5 I hate and every day I keep binging because I have hypoglycemia that my endocrinologist refuses to treat. So if I don't eat sugar constantly I'll have a seizure but I can't take the meds cause I don't have it ""bad enough"" for thyroid meds cause I'm only 22 and they don't give meds to people that young. Tonight I feel like injust can't do it anymore. My friends ditched me today to go to Disneyland and it made me feel even worse. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and face the world, I really feel like I can't wait another day to kill myself"
I just don't know anymore. I hate myself and everything about life.,"Everything has gone wrong today. Just little things, petty things, all built up. I'm 21, i have a girlfriend, and i'm not happy with my life. In fact, i haven't been happy for many years. I'm fed up, i'm over it. I'm sick of my life being this way. But i'm mostly sick of the fact that theres nothing wrong with me, i have no reason to feel worthless, stupid, pointless, hollow. I have nothing to back up my feelings, i can't complain to anyone. My family is far from the emotional type so i don't feel within an inch comfortable of talking to them. I fucking hate everyone. Everyone pisses me off so much, i try and be supportive. I wear my heart on my sleeve. But all that does is bites me on the ass. My relationship is... stagnant? I'm bored. Don't get me wrong, i love her, we have heaps in common, and we do things together. But everyday is the same. Nothing happens. Life is shit. I'm going nowhere. I dropped out of school, i'm going to uni but i don't care for any of it. I have zero motivation to care or change myself, or want better. I want out. But i don't think i'd be able to kill myself, i know there are some people that care about me, and i don't really want to. But i don't want to live in this introverted warped perspective of life i see as hell. I'm so angry. My thoughts don't represent my actions. I want everyone to fuck off, but I want people to stay and listen, and understand me. I don't get myself. pls halp"
"Unbreakable ties. (tl;dr at end, kinda?)","It's really the only reason I'm actually living currently.I live an absolutely hopeless life.  I'm young, yes, only 17.  I haven't really been through any physical shit, though, just really mental.It all felt really mellow, calm, and weak.  Those are the words I can think of to describe it right now.  Years have blended together, and I don't remember many parts of my life, even though it's so short.I don't remember anything in detail before February 27th.  A few days after my birthday.  If you ask me to remember my birthday, I just remember the cake my brother got the image on it for.  It was some ironic meme I really liked and I couldn't stop laughing, and I think that was the best laugh I had ever had in my life.  Then my dad left us ""for good"", only to return 3 months later, without warning.I don't share things with friends.  I've never really had a real friend.  The closest I've had to this day is someone who's arguably more mentally fucked up than I am.  I haven't gone to the beach with some friends, or had a campfire with toasted marshmallows.  The closest thing I've had to that is going on a small camping trip where, while we did do those things, there was infighting before the trip, so it wasn't easy talking and whatnot.  As usual, I played as the guy who would start conversations, act like the idiot I've always been to cheer people up, make jokes, play along, you get the idea.I've only really been useful as a tool.  My life, beginning from when I got an injury, has been this way.  A condition fucked up my leg (It's considered a ""disease"" but it really isn't, it's just an internal physical fuck up) and I couldn't continue my martial arts.  I was 3 belts away from a black belt, and the injury worsened dramatically on the day of my graduation to the next one, to the point where I had to cancel my part on the very day.  I felt so ashamed, even though it wasn't anything I could control.From then on, the doctors told me I couldn't do physical activity.  I was skinnier than a string bean so I saw this as a positive thing at first, but no man, no.  It ruined my life.  The worst part of it was that it was so insignificant; nobody could really realize it was there.  I could feel the disappointment seeping through my P.E teachers' eyes.  I would just sit out every damn time because I had no fucking choice.Ever since then.  I became a tool.  I couldn't walk home, I couldn't walk with my friends home.  I couldn't walk to McDonalds at lunch time, I couldn't walk to my school.  I spent time alone.  So, so much time alone.  I read shitty books, I started playing video games more, I was so close to becoming a shut in, but then this girl came into our school when I was in Grade 7.  (G6 was when I was injured)Lots of details cut, I got a crush on her.  Skip to Grade 10, after lots happened in between, she one day comes to our normal classmate lunch spot on the verge of crying.  I, self-proclaimed genius, end up saying the EXACT wrong words; not exaggeration or anything, either, I basically explained the problem, said why it's bad, then said ""but it's fine!!!"", to sum it up.  Shunned by the mass over there, and so, so fucking rightfully so, I walk back to the corner, with the thought ""holy shit, did I deserve that!"", the feeling of a despicable human being, eating my lunch, and get this; she comes over to me and gives me pity.Yep, about right at that point, I realized something.  Two things, actually.  I don't deserve this.Why?Why did she have to do it?  I don't know.  I'll never know.  I could ask, but I won't get a right answer, let's be honest.I have ties, now.  I think now that if that had never happened, my exit from this shitty existence would just be a detriment to my parents and brother, but no.  Now I've got someone else I owe it to.I'm just a tool.  I didn't explain earlier, but when my parents were in constant quarrels, I was the tiebreaker.  My brother is the literal definition of an asshole and an airhead, my dad is an idiot to such an extent that he ends up just being an ass, and my mom is the definition of pity.My brother, two years younger than me, smokes weed frequently, does really fucking stupid shit ever since he started, acts like an asshole, and forces me to listen to rap, convinced that I am supposed to like it.  Spoilers: I despise rap, but nothing goes through his head.  This mess of a human is the direct result of my parents being too late.  My dad leaving was the ignition to his engine of wrongdoings.My mom being the definition of pity, is a fucking airhead.  After all the time; from 2015 to early 2017, that I spent trying to help her with my dad, she takes it all for granted, focuses on herself once he left, and completely forgets that she has another son; my brother.My dad, Sir. Fuckington the Idiot, III, leaves for 3 months, only a few days after my birthday, and when he comes back, completely without warning, he acts as if he never left, and as if he's a better person.  I was introduced to another mask.  It looks just like the ones all the people in my school wear, except it's much lighter, since you can actually see the absolute asshat peeking through time to time.  The eyeholes are too big, in my opinion.I helped my mom with her emotional struggle with my dad, I helped my dad become a better person, which he always tries to act like he is one, except he's a pretty big idiot, so there's that, and then there's my brother.  I can't do anything about him, so I urge my parents to take some sort of fucking action, but they're both FUCKERS who don't have any brains as far as I'm fucking aware.And, of course, there's her.  This girl who just drops into my life like I owe her something, makes me love her, and then, she's leaving after Grade 12.  All the while, she's harboring more pain than I could imagine of.[tl;dr?]Man, how the fuck am I supposed to live with this?  This is bullshit.  I'm good at this, but I never get a fucking chance to show it to anyone but family.  They barely deserve it, they just took it for granted, and now they too wear masks.  I'm sick of this, and I want to just fucking scream.  Maybe this is all I should've said.  Everyone around me is hiding.  I've gone so far to just hide my depression to bring out people's true emotions, but they hide.  I talk to them with my mental state in mind, and they just brush it off.  ""I'm fine"".  You're becoming adults, for fucks sake, TALK like adults.No, everyone hides everything.  I'm living in a world where everyone's playing hide and seek, except when I find them, they just say ""No, but I'm actually invisible!"" as if we were 6, making up bullshit about how we're invincible, invisible, angels and demons, gods and demigods.I fucking hate it.  What am I supposed to do?  I've wanted to kill myself for a couple years now but I keep holding on for these people.  Some guy last year decided to kill himself because his girlfriend broke up with him after he cheated on her.  I know the girl a bit, she was a very kind girl a few years back but after her family problems, she became just another mask.  After the incident, she disappeared.  She still goes to my school, but her emotions, her feelings, they don't even feel like they exist.It's gross.  It's so god damn disgusting.  I want to go to my school and yell at everyone from the top of my lungs to stop living this sick lie.  But it's far too late.  Everything's too late.I don't want to live in this world anymore, where nothing moves, and nothing has colour.  Where emotions are meaningless unless it's this sickeningly fake happiness everyone pretends to have.  Where friends are numbers, and love is a funny joke.God, I just want to die.  I so, so badly just want to fucking end it all.I'm really sorry this is so long.  It's just that I've written this too many times and I don't know how to make it smaller, so if anyone really reads all of this, leave some type of comment.  Some sign of life.  Thank you."
I don't see any bright or even gray future,"I figured out that i cannot work. and money from family is getting dry. gf is also struggles from mental illness and cannot work too. Need to end this before world ends me. haha. money kills. gf agreed about suicide (in fact, she said about it fiirst). so it is when and how."
So I'm ending it on Wednesday,"I have nothing left to live for. My narcissistic family hate me and my soul mate left me without reason. I have no job, no friends, no family and I can't see any way through. I simply just give up. I want this post to show I love you Scott, I love you Thom, I love you Tom and I love you Camilla. And I'm sorry for the selfishness of what I'm doing. But there is no future for me.  Goodbye.  "
nothing's working,"I recently got into a new hobby that I'm very interested in and I've been able to hang out with close friends. Every time we get to, I have a lot of fun. My boyfriend and I go to different universities so we don't get to see each other often, but he's been starting to visit once a week if I'm lucky. All these things contribute to my happiness, but it's been small, temporary spurts of it. Other days I'll have thoughts of self-harm or jumping in front of a car, things like ""no one will notice me gone"" or ""if I disappear, it may be easier on my family since it's one less mouth to feed, one less tuition to pay for"" or ""if I disappear it won't make a difference in anyone's life"" I just have a constant voice in the back of my head that tells me I don't do good enough, I'm a nuisance to others, and I should kill myself.Ironically I'm very afraid of death so I go to self harm instead; it's like a chicken's way out. I try not to do anything rough enough that it will leave marks, but sometimes bruises or small scars are left.  I just want someone very close who I can confide in and talk about these thoughts, just to let it all out inside of bottling it up inside.. I have extreme trust issues and I don't like talking too much about my feelings.Thank you Reddit for giving me a safe space to vent anonymously. "
"Well off the the ""resort""...","Well my 2 week ""state mandated after """"aggressive"""" suicide attempt"" at a ""mentality resort"" starts today. Luckily I can bring in some of my own things including my phone. Hell they said I can bring my guitar. And while I'll probably come out of there all doped up and God knows how many meds. Maybe I'll find a way to cope with everything..."
Trapped/Suicidal. How? You guessed it. Money.,"I have another account that I often browse with but it�۪s connected to my emails and usernames I use on other sites, so I made this. If this ends up too long I�۪ll add a TL;TR at the end. Recently finished a degree. Got a basic job so I can save for a flat before applying for a Masters degree in 2018. I�۪ve suffered from major anxiety issues for about 7 years, mainly because I was always quite outgoing and confident, then my teeth became overcrowded, sucking the life out of my confidence. But anyway, the current issue is that just as I was getting on my feet financially and being able to dream about finally starting my life properly and paying to get my teeth fixed, my mother has pulled me into an inescapable mire. She�۪s racked up ���, and counting, in rent arrears, not to mention she can�۪t afford to pay her incoming rent (due to issues that aren�۪t really relevant here). This has left me in a position where all my monthly wage goes towards keeping her from being homeless, which has taken away my first real chance to make a real life for myself. There is absolutely no way out of this situation. I�۪ve spoken to relevant departments and benefits experts, but ultimately all roads lead to my life being ruined for as long as she lives. She raised me, I know, and I don�۪t hold a grudge against her. But I�۪m older than I�۪d like to admit and it has taken me so long to get to where I am, with what seemed to be real opportunities ahead of me. Now my life exists to work an uninspiring job, with zero confidence and anxiety issues that are off the charts. If I lived in the US I�۪d buy a gun and end it. Too scared to do the pills/whisky thing, too scared to do anything else really. And as much as people will say things will get better, they can�۪t. I�۪m completely trapped in this situation, a situation I can�۪t handle for much longer.TL;TR: After a long, long time I finally got my life on the right path, had a plan to tackle my anxiety and a clear plan to move on with my life. Suddenly my mother tells me she owes ��� in rent arrears and will be made homeless if I don�۪t pay her rent and set up a payment plan for the arrears. It�۪s taken me longer than I�۪d care to admit, even online, to get to a stage in my life where I could finally move forward but the moment it appeared it�۪s been taken from me. Suicide appears to be my only option because as selfish as it sounds, I need to progress with my life and after all this time, energy and work, I can�۪t do that. It�۪s over for me. Appreciation to anybody who even scanned this post. And to the Mods, if this is in the wrong place, I apologise. "
I wonder when I'll do it.,"I know it's going to be the way I go out. In my life I keep coming back to my depression. I have periods in my life where I'm happy. But I always come back to this. It's exhausting. And I just want to end it, but I hate that my family will be pained by it. I hate living here. I hate existing.I went to church today. I haven't gone in like 4 years. I used to be really devout. But then I fell away. Today after service they were having a time for people to come up and be prayed for. So when mostly everyone was gone, I went up there and talked to a man. He was very kind. And I just started breaking down as I said the words ""I'm just going through a really hard time right now."" And he was understanding that it was hard for me to say much more than that. And he prayed with me. It felt really relieving for awhile. Idk if God is real or not. So idk if it was Him making me feel comforted or if it was just another person caring for me in that moment as I was vulnerable.I'm just so desperate for something to make me happy again. I'm so desperate for just security again. And I hate that I'm always going to live my life doing this roller coaster. Likely after my father passes away, I'll do it. I couldn't do it to him. He's got some time left so I'm not doing it any time soon. But I'm just in so much pain right now, it's hard to function. I think if I ever did, a lot of people would be shocked. They'd probably never see it coming. "
My sense of self-worth is gone,"I feel like my life just isn't worth it anymore. I can't let go if the past. My whole life is just a bunch of reminders why I'm in this terrible, hopeless place in my life. I'll never be okay with who I am and as much as death scares me I just don't see the fucking point if I'll always consider myself a loser."
Broken and on the brink,"These past few weeks were more or less a storm for me; breaking up with my fianc̩e (and our son staying with her), getting a new job where almost every one of my colleagues hates me openly or secretly, getting ripped at by my siblings because I have to get a handle with eventually living on my own... If anything, however, there are only three things holding me back from taking the final step. In no particular order:All that being said, I'm a Filipino male with prior attempts on the edge. "
"Hi these are probably the last thing of mine someone will read . I'm stood on the top of a multistorey parking lot, any help is appreciated , before someone says this is a fake account because I just made it, I just didn't want people seeing my main account, see ya in hell",Are you still here?
Someone just help me find a way to kill myself.,I'm tired. I'm always chronically unhappy and foreveralone. What are some ways to kill oneself that are pain-free and quick?
Two bridges.,"There are two bridges my mind are focused on right now in my hometown, both of which I'm thinking of jumping off.One of them will make me plunge into a river. The other goes into train tracks.My name is Koda. This is not my first suicide note online. I don't think it'll be my last, but I hope it will. I'm 16. I'm studying Media at college. I really want to be a film editor. Something about working my way around Adobe Premiere, seeing what movements and transitions and shots work really makes me happily satisfied.I'm also really lonely, especially since I began college a few weeks ago. Any friends I used to have have found new ones and I've been left alone. My former best friend is gone too. I don't care. I'm almost glad. All he cares about his sex and drugs. Last time I spoke to him, it was asking if he could lend some pot because my uncle was dying and I was getting worked up about it. He said he didn't have any. He's a liar. I've seen his Snapchat and Instagram. Coke has taken my friend away from me, and until he sorts his shit out I don't want associate with him.My uncle died by the way. He didn't even check up on that. No sympathy. Maybe I'll fuck him over and rat him out to his parents, because they're sweethearts and deserve a better son.And then there's this girl who I've been infatuated with for a couple years now. We've kissed but never made anything serious out of it. It makes me sad and wonder if there's something wrong with me. Oh well. She's been there for me a lot. I owe her that.I don't know where I'm going with this. I just wish I could stop existing.If this had to be how a proper suicide note goes, then I guess I'll thank my sister for being better than anyone in this stupid fucking house. And my adorable little hamster Pippin - you rock, Pips.That's all. I'm thinking of killing myself in the sixteenth of October. On the 15th I'm in London seeing a show. I wouldn't miss that for the world.Have a better life, everyone."
It'll just get worse,Dude my life just gets worse as I get older.  I stay broke and can't ever get anywhere.  Live with parents and I can't leave life is fucking miserable and it has been for the last 8 years.
Suicide?,"I'm at the point in my life now where I genuinely don't know if I want to live anymore. It's 50/50. Half of me wants to live and half of me wants non-existence. I feel like suicide would be the ultimate freedom.I first started really considering suicide when my OCD got to the point where I would do retarded repedetive shit and have non-stop tormenting OCD thoughts all day, every single day. I have for the most part overcome my OCD now, but the thoughts of suicide remain.I am a 19 year old high school dropout, unemployed, porn and cigarette addict, virgin, never had a girlfriend and pretty socially isolated nowadays. I don't feel connected to anyone. I don't feel any love for anyone. Not even my own immediate family. I don't feel close to anyone. I am pretty numb and dead inside.I see a lot of people say they wish they could kill themselves, but couldn't do that to the people around them. I don't feel that way at all. It may make me a selfish piece of shit, but I honestly could give a fuck how my suicide affects anyone. It's my life and I will be dead, so I literally won't be able to give a fuck.I have tried countless times to turn my life around in past, but inevitably ALWAYS end up failing.I'm still on the fense about whether or not I want to kill myself. So my plan is to give myself until June 1st, 2018 (a week before I turn 20) to try my best to show myself that my life is worth living. If I can't do that and am still in this same position by then, then it is time to end this once and for all.I can't take this same old cycle of the same old bullshit any longer then 8 months. It must end one way or another. It will end either through self-improvement or suicide."
Life�۪s pointless,So 4 weeks ago on Wednesday my best freind killed herself we met at the clinic after I�۪d attempted suicide that was 2 and a half years ago.At first I was angry at myself then at her and now life just seems pointless.My therapist said I should reach it to people and get help so here I am.Since she died I�۪ve attempted suicide twice and I�۪ve constantly thought about death.
Having anxiety AND being ugly is hell on earth.,"So I have social anxiety. As far as dating, it wouldn't be that big of a deal, as I can just use dating apps. However, I am too ugly for dating apps. So the majority of people tell me to just find dates IRL. But I have too much social anxiety for that shit to do IRL. So it goes right back to dating apps which I am too ugly for. Today a cute girl in my friend circle invited me to a party that takes place tonight. I usually can do good in social situations if I drink. However, I have to be up for work in the AM and I can't afford to go in late anymore. I am 28. I am an old fart and it is too late. I wish I could get my youth back, but I can't. Suicide is the only option. "
Suicide Note. What do you think?,"My name is Austin. I�۪m 20 years old and aboriginal. My final few days were spent drinking. A Mickey a night. And then a big bottle the final night. 5 nights in a row. I�۪m doing this because the stress of sustaining or even beginning a career has become to much. I don�۪t even know what I�۪m doing with my life anymore. I can�۪t even say much about how I feel anymore. It�۪s just pain. Numbness, regret, sorrow, guilt. It�۪s always ���I�۪ll stop drinking tomorrow�۝. Tomorrow is the day that never comes for me.  "
I've seen enough,"I decided to go off the grid from my friends to see if anyone would text, tag, or otherwise try to get a hold of me. It's clear from zero fucking messages that they don't care."
"Relapsing, past issues are still here","I feel ashamed of my mental health issues. I started struggling at 15 years old, with social anxiety, self harm, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts and ideation...never talked about my problems, my family still doesnt know.  Now I'm 22, still struggle with social anxiety but its better...but I feel ashamed bc I'm self harming again, I self harmed 2 weeks ago, I got angry with my father that always criticize me. I also feel depressed again, I'm studying at university but I doubt myself a lot. How can I find jobs with social anxiety? I still struggle when I talk with others. I feel lost, I think about suicide, I'm afraid I'll kill myself if I don't find my path, my purpose. I wanted a job where I could help people, I did 3 years at university for this and I really wanted to and still want to help! But how can I help if I'm struggling? I feel like a burden...I'm wasting my parents money. If I kill myself they don't have to waste money for me anymore. Tomorrow I'll call a new therapist I really need one!...I'm ashamed because I'm relapsing with everything. But I'm afraid I'll start therapy and don't get better then what?���"
Work is making me suicidal,"I have really big problems with anxiety and am miserable 24/7 due to work anxiety. I would rather kill myself than go to work another day. In fact I think about suicide every minute of every day. This morning I almost ran my car into a wall at 60 miles per hour to avoid going in today. It's getting harder to fight suicide at this point. I need the money for rent however and to pay other bills. I also don't want to hurt my wife since my death would devisate her. I don't really know what to do because everything in my life is dependent on me having a job but my life is at risk from the job. Even if I could fight the anxiety long enough to get a new job it wouldn't help, i would  hate that job because of anxiety too. I really don't know what to do and med and doctors have been no help. I really don't think a doctor or medicine changes would help me fast enough at this point. I need advice. Anything."
How to say good bye properly,"So basically I have decided that I am over being alive. I have been suicide since I was 12 maybe 13yrs old. I had a shitty past couple weeks and I do not feel like doing this any more. I have not fully decided the method but have narrowed it down to two different ways. One is bullet to the head. The other is OD on heroin. My question is this, how do I say good bye to the only friend I have? I don't know if it matters but I am a male and my friend is a female. I've known her for about 8 years now. Really the only reason I have made it this far is because of her. We have never done anything together as far as sex goes. We have never kissed. I normally see her a few times a week and spend the night at her house most the time when we hang out. I sleep in her bed next to her when I spend the night. She has begun to be part of the problem though. It's not her, it's me. Any way she knows what is going on and we are suppose to hang out tonight. Obviously she wants to try and talk me out of it and keep me from doing it. I on the other hand want to do it and will do it. It is only a matter of time now. I just want to tell her good bye but I am not sure how exactly I should do this. I could just hang out and say good bye but I feel she deserves something a little more unique. So how should I do this? Any suggestions? She is the only friend I have had that has never fucked me over or used me until I had nothing left to give. Her and I have been through hell together. Any way let me know what you guys think I should do. Thank you. "
I'm gonna kill myself,I HATE MYFUCKING LIFE I'M SO TRAPPED ALONE AND ISOLATED IT DOESNT CHANGE HASN'T CHANGED IN 5 YEARS MY PARENTS ARE CONTROLLING IM 23 YEARS OLD THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WANNA BE FRIENDS ARE FUCKING WEIRDOS WHO WANT TO MASTURBATE TO ME AND HAVE SEX WITH ME YOU FUCKING LOSERS KILL YOURSELVES I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIENDS! YOU EITHER LEAVE ME IN THE DUST OR JUST WANNA FUCK ME I HATE YOU YOU STUPID FAT UGLY BITCH LOSERS! WHY CANT NO ONE BE GENUINE WHY DOES NO ONE ELSE CARE ABOUT ME OR WANNA BE MY FRIEND I'M A LOSER AND ALONE IN THIS WORLD I WANNA END IT ALL
"Messed up, now my suicidal obsessions are back.","So I got drunk with a friend of mine and we ended up fooling around. It was pretty tame but we did screw a little, and though I didnt ejaculate, i was an idiot and didn't use protection. Well that shits left me fucked up. Ive gone 40+ hours without sleep, and all I can think about is how I should of killed myself long before this moment.It  was a lot of fun and she taught me some cool shit, but it just feels wrong that it happened, and the no condom thing has me freaking out. Im in control enough right now to get to a hospital if I start going down further, but Im just hoping and can maintain that. I don't know how anyone can really help me here, but this one of those times where I'm really struggling and I just have to put these thoughts somewhere where someone may understand...Edit: my suicidal ideations/ obsessions had been coming back alot recently because of stress. This situation really just made it worse."
"I cry every week, hesitant","I know a painless way to stop my heart, but I keep living. Just the thought of not having college education and working for the rest of my life depresses me further. I live in a shelter on disability income, because people in my head make me talk to them or yell at them. Hard to focus on reality. If my goals fail, I will likely do it."
Just wishing i was dead.,"I don't know if this means anything to you, but I just saw your post on this sub from half a year ago thanks to the search tool, and I checked your username to see if you made another post. I'm relieved to see that you did (hence why I'm here) and that you're still alive, even if things still aren't great for you right now.  I don't know what to say as I'm not the best person for giving advice, but some internet stranger is glad that you're not dead and that you're still staying strong. "
Tired and feeling defeated,"I cant sleep, my head is full of thoughts and they are all about killing myself. another night of crying myself to sleep i guess
too tired for this shit anymore"
I'm suicidal again,"I'm in an unhealthy relationship that is starting to make me consider killing myself. I cut for the first time in my life because of the stress and the fact that I have to bottle everything up, otherwise I'll get yelled at. I could use a friend or a funny story or something to distract me. Thanks"
Can�۪t stop thinking about it.,"I just really want to tell someone how sad I am, and that I think about dying all the time. I�۪m not going to kill myself, because my mom would be too sad, and I know she�۪ll need me to take care of her soon (she�۪s aging and has a neurological disorder). I just can�۪t stop wishing I didn�۪t have to be here anymore. And I can�۪t talk about it because I don�۪t want someone to put me in a mental institution or something and I don�۪t want my friends to worry. I�۪ll be ok I think. I�۪m going to therapy. It�۪s just taking a long time and I don�۪t know if I�۪ll ever be happy. I just have to keep getting by I guess. Thank you for listening. "
National Suicide Prevention online chat,"I've finally convinced myself to try it, and it won't work for me. It really sucks because when I actually feel ready to talk to someone I can't. I tried two days ago, tried again today and the chat never loads... I just really wish it would, and I don't want to do a phone call"
I just swallowed pills,My heart is racing idk what�۪s gonna happen but I hope I die
advice needed,"I was diagnosed with MDD and for the past month almost all my thoughts have either been self hating or planning/ talking myself into my suicide. My family knows hardly anything about my troubles, I am very good at keeping things to myself through years of experience. Imagine if your 20 year old came and told you ""i've been suicidal for almost a decade, have more than a dozen attempts, and MDD?"" it would be truly heart breaking. it would almost come out of nowhere to them. Sometimes I think the truth may be better hidden.
I don't think I can live a decent life. I am not capable of it. I hurt people without realizing it. How can I be a good person? I think one of the most important things in life is human connections but what if you have trouble making them?
Please someone help, I am very much on the edge. I would appreciate an older parent's perspective on all of this"
Why? Is life even worth living anymore?,My life honestly doesnt have any meaning anymore. I am a student pilot about 250 hours in towards my 1500 hours needed for an ATP and I literally seem to fail at doing everything but these two tasks in my life. Flying airplane and watching/playing hockey. Every night I just want to die for one reason or another. Another friend abandoning me. Failing with another woman. Fucking up something else up. If I went on a solo tomorrow and I wrecked the airplane I could think of less than 10 people who would actually give a shit and my parents aren't even on that list. Each day is a repeat of the previous. My dad permanantly kicked my out of his house because I bought a hockey jersey he didn't like (T.J. Oshie Team USA to be specific) and my mom won't let me see her without a girlfriend fiance or wife. Honestly everything is in the shitter and my life isn't worth living. My only escapes are flying and watching nhl games or playing in beer league matches but that can only do so much. Do I go to a doctor or one of those people who give a shit? Just end it? Pull a germanwings?
I give up,"I just give up on everything. I made that nice long post yesterday. Only got one thing back from it and it wasn't much of anything. I poured my soul out into it. And just got a simple two sentence message. I just give up. My posts constantly get downvoted to 0. I get trolled HARD. So hard that it has literally put me in a full blown panic attack mode a few times and have made me cry. I know, they are just words on a screen. But you need to understand, I've grown up in a family that has dished out physical, emotional, and verbal abuse to me. I'm fragile and it doesn't take much now for things to make me crack. I don't even think that I need to be here anymore. I don't even think I need to be on this planet anymore. "
i don't belong,"i'm asexual. i don't belong. minority groups reject me because apparently i don't suffer enough. i tried to send a message of empowerment. people minimise my struggles. i don't belong. i'm immature. i'm worthless if i'm asexual. i'm broken. no one wants to be with someone like me. something is seriously wrong with me. and no one wants to support me. i don't belong anywhere. i thought i might, in the warm hearted community i thought it would be. but they hate me because my struggle isn't real. i don't belong. anywhere. there's no place for me in this world."
"Girlfriend just left me, I have no friends, parents don't care about me. I've failed.",Why should I keep on living?
My girlfriend told me she wants to die.,I'm the only reason she hasn't done it yet. How do I teach her to love life?
Want to Die,"Nearly 29 never had a GF, western women have all rejected me. Stuck studying nursing even though I hate it. Researching how to end it considering hanging as a option if I can get the technique down right. Why aren't I allowed to kill myself over never having a GF? It will never happen and I'm not going to spend my life working to support a society that has fucked beta males like me over so I can be a tax dollar drone. "
People would want me dead anyway,"Very brief background, and sorry for being vague on the details: I have a form of OCD that makes me scared of hurting kids. If people knew the sorts of things that went on in my head, most would think that the world would be a better place without me around. Context wouldn't make a fucking difference, it'd just be ""how can you think that? You need a bullet"" for most people.I can't help being like this; there's nothing I want more than for these thoughts to be gone. But here we are, and I feel terrible about both the thoughts themselves and how I process them pretty much constantly. The worst part is that I can't talk to anyone openly about this. For a start, I don't have time or the sufficient self-worth to actually approach a health professional, and even if I did, I couldn't actually say what was really happening without risking undue drama if what I said was misinterpreted. So I guess it's time to draw a line. I really don't want to, but I just feel like I'm out of options. I really don't want to be alive anymore when all I have to look forward to is a dramatic crash and months of crippling anxiety and self-hatred any time I have the audacity to think that I have a future. Please talk me out of it."
I envy those of you who don't believe in God.,"I really just want to die. I hate my job. I hate my home. I hate how my family is since my dad died. Religious fear is the only thing stopping me, and my dog (which my mum claims she's giving away for no reason). Wish I had the balls to just end it. Instead I'm trapped. I can't sleep well and I'm hearing shit that isn't there because of it, I'm never calm or relaxed.. I'm never happy, or excited. Just anxious or tense or nothing. Nothing can or will change in the next few years. I'm stuck.. just gotta cop it all as much as I hate saying it. No friends to lean on, no family to care for me. I really wish I could just die in my sleep most nights. One day maybe.. Thanks for reading my rant. Needed to let it out and have no other medium."
A friend is on the verge of suicide.,"Hi.
A friend of mine is going through a ridiculously hard time at the moment, she isn�۪t eating or drinking and feels alone. I have had to talk her out of killing herself so many times already and I don�۪t know how many more times she�۪s going to listen to me. The problem here is that we live hours away from each other so I can literally only help her over a phone. What can I do? She literally has no one to talk to apart from me."
I think im gonna do it tonight. I just can't go on,I think I'm gonna kill myself tonight. I just can't go on. I just feel worthless. All the time. I'm not telling anyone. I'm just gonna buy some climbing rope after work and do the deed. Don't know why I'm posting here. I guess I just want to tell someone that I'm going before I leave.
The end of a meaningless and destructive life.,"I  have destroyed my relationships, I have hurt countless people with my issues and my mentality. I am pure darkness, I am the personification of a black hole. I take good things and I sabotage them.  I  could be happy,but something  inside me wants pain and suffering. I will not live after this, life is pain and  people that feel otherwise should enjoy their lives and let my life end. I just want to die, other people are so much stronger than me. I can't live with  the things I have done. Everyone that ever loved me or knew me, ended up much worse for the experience. There is not much to do but to plan.I wish everyone in the world knew me, so they could hate me the way I hate myself. Maybe I am manipulating you now, I have no idea, too far gone.  Nothing worse than natural evil thinking it's inherent good. Goodbye."
I'm scared of my own mind.,I think I'm suicidal. I don�۪t know why or how. But I feel it. I just thought about and cried. Not sad cry or happy cry. I cried like I�۪m scared. Like I know I�۪m suicidal but I don�۪t know��_ I cant think. I�۪m typing this now thinking about why I�۪m suicidal or maybe I�۪m just trying to get it out of me but��_ I don�۪t know. I�۪m scared of my own mind. It�۪s smarter than me. My subconscious mind is smarter than my conscious mind and I think its trying to kill me. I�۪m scared. When I look tot the future I see nothing. There is nothing for me there. I�۪m scared. I�۪ve calmed down. I still can�۪t think but I�۪m no longer crying. I smoked 2 cigarettes and well I don�۪t know. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I mean yes there is people to talk to. My friend Jake and my cousin Marc. My mom and dad. But I feel like burdening them to tell them this. Or maybe I�۪m just to scared to see the effect of telling. This originally started out as a way to get my thoughts out rather than keeping them bottled up in my head where I usually keep them but I think ill post this to a suicide help subreddit. No one can see me there. I�۪m just a name.
"I feel lost, and ultimately stuck","I'm not at immediate risk of suicide. I feel okay right now. But lately, I've caught myself fantasizing about peaceful ways of suicide. I'm not even going through anything traumatic or anything. But it's incredibly unlike me to be suicidal or even give it a thought. And I think it's rooted from me moving out for the first time and not looking back. I feel like I've made a mistake, even though I'm making decent money and am able to sustain myself with it. I don't even know if this is just me being stupid and not liking the transition to adulthood. I honestly have no idea. But some days I just go numb and my mind wanders into suicidal territory. Not out of sorrow, but out of a genuine longing to escape whatever the feeling I was experiencing was.I'm currently about to clock into work, so I will probably stop replying for a few hours. But I just wanted to get all of this off of my chest. I haven't told a soul out of fear that someone will just resort to ""this guy's just being an attention-whore/he's got nothing to feel bad about"", not to mention it's kind of a big deal to say to a family member that I've recently had suicidal thoughts. Anyway, I appreciate you guys for listening to me mumble. And this might not even be the right sub, as I'm not fixing to do the deed. If that's the case, go ahead and remove it, as I'll be away from reddit for a bit. Thanks. "
"Failed attempt 1 month ago, going again.","I've lost all motivation to do anything, school work, any activities, even video games which I was completely addicted to only a year ago. Now I mainly just lay in my bed wondering why I even exist, for hours on end. I've legitimately thought about suicide ever since I was 13, with time this thought got worst and now at the age of 17 I've lost count of how many times I tried to take my own life. Just a month ago I had an extremely scary attempt. I hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if I stood on my tip toes I could barely breath, then I let my legs relax and swung them in front of me, I was completely blacked out within a few seconds. But then about 3 minutes later I just woke up for no apparent reason, the rope didn't break and there was still full suspension on my neck, but I still fucking woke up and survived. I didn't leave a note or anything, I just really, really wanted to fucking die that night.That was scary enough to make me stop for a month, waking up with a rope around your neck, cold, with saliva running down your face, slowly realizing where you are and what happened. But now the suicidal thoughts return and I want to try again. Perhaps I should tell someone about my problems, but they'd just call someone and take me to a hospital. Being someone who actually wants to die, constant supervision at a hospital is not ideal.School mainly instigates these suicidal actions, I once cried for a whole night over the score I got on a practice test, and I believe I came very close to killing myself that night too, anything can trigger it. I must just have a really fucking muscular neck because I can not kill myself via hanging, I have tried literally 100+ times now, but I'm going to keep trying."
I don't think I'll ever find love again...,"I am 26 years old, I am Korean American but I really don't feel like I fit in either with fobs or Americanized Koreans. I've had quite weird experiences in my life that has to do with religion and occultic stuff, so I call myself Isaac ( A long story that has to do with the name) now.
Anyways I am Christian, but not exactly a normal Christian.
I've been quite popular with girls in some situations... but there were many reasons why I couldn't get close to them. I am kind of complicated, anyways the other girls I don't really remember, yet this one girl(And this other girl just not as much)... I don't think I'll ever meet someone like that again (I am not as attractive as I used to be)... I think she was my soul mate.
I wasn't ready and I am a failure. I am contemplating suicide now.
I am so different from other people, with radical beliefs, and I am kind of weird... Most of the girls I know they don't fit me... I would rather not start a relationship I can see going sour in the future...
Honestly she was the only girl I ever met like that in my life I think, she was truly rare...
Anyone else feel like this?"
Autism-related disorder makes me want to die,"(Not sure if this is the right place to post.) I have a disorder related to autism, and as a result connecting with or relating to people on the same level as everyone else is basically impossible. Even saying hi to strangers passing on the sidewalk is terrifying; literally part of my diagnosis is that I ""will always be excessively quiet and have very few friends."" I can't not ""let my diagnosis define me"", as people like to say, when my behavior is predestined and incurable. Every day is filled with humiliation and isolation, and though I've tried for years to fight the coldness and loneliness and isolation that surrounds me, tried to fix or accept myself, this feeling of meaninglessness never leaves. I've had a history of depression since I was 12 and though it's been low-level for many years, I doubt it will ever go away by this point, given that I'm 20 now. The only real reason I don't kill myself is so I won't make my mom upset, given that she does so much for me already; I thought about crashing into an empty car as I was driving home and veered near it, not entirely seriously, but it would break her heart and cost the other person greatly. Similarly, swallowing a bottle of pills would traumatize the family. Being in a relationship temporarily made things feel worthwhile, but I'm not eager to start dating again, someone sticking with me as long as my ex did was really unusual. Literature, arts give me a small sense of meaning, but it's ephemeral and fleeting, a blink of passion and it's over. Nothing has made living this life truly worth it, nothing has given me lasting warmth. "
"I [23 F] am struggling with suicidal thoughts again and, though I don't believe that I would go through with it, it's difficult to wake up every morning.","For a bit of background, a lot has happened to me recently and this isn't the first time I've felt suicidal. I've been quite depressed for the past year and a half- at one point, around 6 months ago, I started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though I suspect it was mostly cathartic. I'm not sure. I will also note that three years ago I had a drug overdose that I believe was a suicide attempt, but I am not quite sure. I was sort of in auto-pilot that day. At the moment, I'm finishing my degree, moving out, am seeing a psychiatric who believes I have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and self-hate. I'm crying almost every day. I truly believe that the people around me are sick of me and/or hate me but feel obliged to stick around. The heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end. For instance, around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends, but I had a prior commitment. He said he had decided to go later and I said 'I might come too then' and he ignored the statement and planned around me. I literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me because I'm probably a buzzkill or he's tired of me, and he probably doesn't care at all if he didn't even try to give an excuse or anything. This is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of self-esteem.I don't want to be around myself either but I don't have a choice. I'm scared of finishing my degree because I think I might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamed. I'm scared of staying with my aunt if I don't find a new place to live soon enough, and my lease is up in two weeks. I'm scared of getting diagnosed with bipolar. I'm scared of losing everyone in my life. I'm just so tired and I want to sleep all of the time, I don't have the capability to get through the next month. I wish I could pause time and find a hotel room so I could just sleep and cry alone for half a year. I really don't know what to do. I'm struggling to live minute to minute. "
Is there any way to get help without actually calling the suicife hotline? I'm terrafied of someone walking in on that phone call. But it's not like I've got much left to lose.,"I just I'm upset. And I am trying so hard to get through school and then leave the situation that is causing me problems but the longer I'm here the higher the likelihood of me winding up dead is. Seriously, I need help. And I can't do anything about the probably somewhat abusive situation.(idk. It isn't legally considered abuse and I don't exactly have the ability to go get theroist to figure things out.)
The one thing o cafe about I feel like I'm not any good with. I wan to end it. I'm scared to. But I need to talk to someone who can actually do something about the situation. Or at least reconsider my options "
"i ""survived"" a panic attack and feel proud of it","These past 7~ months have been awful since my depression came back. Ive been having panic attacks almost every night and its driving me nuts. Suicide thoughts every day for sure. Killing myself looked nice just to stop the panic attacks for once.However, i faced it this time, went outside, took deep breaths, i even downloaded this app called ""Antistress"" and, man, this may sound stupid but it really helps and i could stop them this time.It feels so nice once you beat this shit. I felt like sharing it because i know how hard this is to face depression, face anxiety, face panic, but sometimes you just need to try a little and, believe me, its worth the try"
I can't take being screamed at and hit any more,"I just got in a really big fight with my mom after she hit me and I yelled at her about how she doesn't care about me or make time for me and cares more about her canning She brushed me off because her beets she's canning are so fucking important and I'm gonna fuck them up like I fuck up everything and then she said her councillor told her to ignore me and I'm so mad because she's never let me have a councillor and she expects me to do everything myself and I'm putting myself through college and working full time and it's the first time I've been home in days and I was kinda excited to see her and i can hear her in the kitchen fucking canning beetsshe doesn't realize how much our fights affect me and how I cry for hours. She started crying and now I can hear her laughing upstairs and I think I'm gonna go ahead and kill myself now because why should I live with people who hate me clearly she doesn't fucking care about me enough to just take one fucking minute to talk to me or even apologize so fuck you mom.The worst part is I actually feel bad for making her cry and not accepting her initial ""apology"" but there's no way I'm going to say sorry she's never genuinely apologized to me in my life I know I have a responsibility in this fight and I have no problem apologizing and owning up but the fact that she thinks she's faultless is making me rip my hair out Edit I was just looking at my last post about how much I hate her and I mention her not asking about my new job and surprise surprise one of the reasons I'm so hurt is she hasn't bothered to ask me how I'm doing at my new job or school! ( also I realize how much of a brat I sound like but these little things are killing me and I have no one to tell them to)"
Why can't I just do it already?,"Hey , I turned 20 yesterday and it couldn't possibly have been a better day to end my life. You might be wondering why I didn't do it then - Well, I'm not sure. I felt so ready to finally end my suffering and the pain but I just couldn't push myself over the edge of actually doing it. All I wished for was for it all to be finally over but I just couldn't do it myself.This is my story:My life so far has been what most people would consider normal: I grew up, had friends and family, everything I could only wish for, etc. But since I went to highschool I haven't had a single friend I could rely on and talk to.My family always just ignored me when they could and blamed everything that was going wrong on me. Everybody wished for me to be gone.Until a few years ago I met a girl and fell totally in love with her. I asked her out and all and we started dating and became a couple. Everything was fine and I was already playing with the thought that she is the girl I want to marry.Then she hits me with this: She doesn't love me anymore or at least she isn't sure about what she is feeling but it isn't the same anymore.After she told me this my world was slowly starting to fall apart and I became more depressed with each day passing.A few months go by and we're still trying to work it out - At least I'm trying to. But it just won't get better and a few weeks ago she broke up with me.I'm crushed and everything I have ever wanted to do in life just became irrelevant. She gave me a reason to live and now that she's gone and has moved on I find myself wishing to die every day.I tried writing letters to say goodbye to my family which probably won't miss me that much since I only always annoyed them. But I just couldn't figure out what to write so I said fuck it. I collected the things which always made me happy when I was down - Photos of me and her, things she gifted me and so on and told her where she could find them if she ever wanted them.Then I tried to find the courage to end my, so far very miserable, existence. But I just couldn't do it. All I want is that the pain and suffering finally ends.Please help me"
what would u do if u were me,"no money, i cant even buy foods now and i cant have a job. and i tried to take a loan but i couldnt.now i dont really have a choice isnt it? what would u do if u were me? its ok to say just kill ur self to me cuz i dont care anymore"
Like playing tennis with a wall.,"Every day I don't kill myself is like returning the ball. Eventually, I won't be able to return it."
Why am I like this?,"I fucking hate myself. Idk how to form relationships with people.i did things in high school to people that I can never take back. Everytime I see someone in public look at me, I instantly say in my head, ""I could fucking murder you right now."" I have trust problems. I can't trust my family or friends. I could have literally ended it right there on the back roads by crashing into a tree. I just wanna fucking die. The worst that would happen to my family is they would be sad a few days and then get over it. I'm 19. I thought getting off my adhd meds would help. But, my problems are deeper then that. Recently, I've even thought of killing an animal or something to get anger out. I thought this way back in ith grade. Me and my ex friend killed a bird and burned it in the woods. I threatened to blow up a kid at the bus stop. I think of killing myself everyday. I bought a bunch of 10mg melatonin today. Idk if that'll work. I know a guy with a gun. I have money, maybe I can buy it from him. Maybe that will work. I thought it would get better, but no. It hasn't. I just don't want to live anymore. Please just fucking kill me. Idk why I can't kill myself. Maybe I was just meant to live in pain.I always said, I'll give it two years. Probably 2 years ago I said that. Maybe now is my time to go. Only one person I know knows how deep I am into this. And even then, thats not all. I have no respect for people or myself. I started cutting again yesterday. I don't fucking know. Maybe I should just kill myself. The only thing that has kept me alive for this long is music. It just distracts me from my reality I guess. It's literaly the only thing that I view as worth living for. Maybe it isn't even worth living for. Idfc anymore. Just thought I'd share."
I hate myself.,"There are probably so many people on here who feel this but I'm going to share anyway.
I hate myself. I hate everything about who I am and there's nothing I will ever be able to do about it. No matter what I do, I will always be wrong somehow and there's no way I can change that. I always mess up. One day soon, if not you, i will have messed up badly enough that no matter what I say or do, my boyfriend will break up with me and I will know for certain that I am nothing and have no purpose. At that point I will kill myself and rid the world of this pathetic life I am living. I just want to go ahead SMS give an open apology to any and all who have had to deal with my insane bullshit, including my boyfriend who already recognizes the failure I am who is nowhere good enough for anyone, especially him. I'm sorry. Maybe soon it will be over.
Goodnight. "
"I don't wanna hurt my family, I don't want to go to a hospital, I don't wanna live anymore.","I was diagnosed with MDD and for the past month almost all my thoughts have either been self hating or planning/ talking myself into my suicide. My family knows hardly anything about my troubles, I am very good at keeping things to myself through years of experience. Imagine if your 20 year old came and told you ""i've been suicidal for almost a decade, have more than a dozen attempts, and MDD?"" it would be truly heart breaking. it would almost come out of nowhere to them. Sometimes I think the truth may be better hidden. I don't think I can live a decent life. I am not capable of it. I hurt people without realizing it. How can I be a good person? I think one of the most important things in life is human connections but what if you have trouble making them?Please someone help, I am very much on the edge. I would appreciate an older parent's perspective on all of this "
I DONT WANT TO DO IT BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO CHOCIE,"EVEN HERE MY PARENTS CARE 2 MUCH ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY 2 EVEN RECOGNIZE ME. This may sound as a cry for attention, but I  really need help"
Tired,"There are some days I feel so happy I feel like dancing on the stars. Then there are some days I crash and everything gets too hard. Simple things like talking to people, seeing or breathing feel impossible. I have no desire to do anything. I just want to avoid everything and everyone. I want to hide in some dark corner until those emotions fade. I know they'll fade. They always do. Yet time ticks on ahead and I'm still in the same place as I was a day ago or decades ago. Everything around me has changed and I become unable to cope. The stress of that makes me crash and the cycle continues. It's fucked up. My mind just can't deal with stress anymore. My priority is hiding my emotions, and I end up left with no strength at all to deal with things. I just don't know how I will. I'm losing it. "
This Is It,"My heart hurts
My head is not the safe haven it used to beAll of my friends have moved on
And my girl isn't my girl anymoreI wish you were near
But it hurts too goddamn muchShit, I'm looking at my pills again
Im starting to get lonely again
Cause I'm too scared to make friends
Cause everything thats good always ends"
The right to die,"In this world we live in, every one stands up for their rights (when they can) We have people who stand up for Marriage equality, the right to lead the lifestyle they choose, whether it be gay. If you ask is being gay normal, people get upset and say yes of course it is, I was born gay they would possibly say.
People are becoming more persistent with their rights, their freedoms. People insist that they are to be referred to in a certain way, Sir, Madam, regard transgender communities and get upset when they are not.... blah blah blah. Black lives matter,  white lives matter, fucking this group that group. Everyone stands up for a cause they strongly believe in.
What about the right to die? Why cant we see this as normal. All my life I have wanted to die. I have lost count of how many times I have tried with overdoses. One of the last few times I tried was by hanging, only for things to go black, and for me to wake up gasping for air..failed again. Other times people would always find me unconscious from the overdoses, when I was pretty sure there was no way for them to, and the door was locked. And last week, I took a whole batch of valium and alprazolam in a bowl washed it down with water..and apparently I was the one who called 000 and an ambulance. I can get completely smashed with alcohol and remember what I do, but my wife when she came home after the ambulance took me to the fucking hospital says that I had been vomiting in the toilet, and somehow I went for the phone and dialed for the ambulance. What the fuck I can not remember this. Is it a cry for attention, no! Just so they can put me in an acute ward, and I loose all my jobs that I do for a week and things just get fucking worse.
Do I really want to die. Yes and No. If we didn't live in this fucked up world, of course not. But we do, so fuck yeah I want to die. I am certainly not encouraging others to do so, this is my choice, I believe my rights, just like everyone else thinks their rights are normal. You can put me on all the fucking meds you like, that is not going to stop my reasoning and thinking, that I feel I have the right to die. I can actually attest to this. I am on them now.
So my question is why don't we have euthanasia clinics for those who see no way out, and have lost all hope. Not just those for elderly terminally ill. Why don't we have those rights?
We lived in a fucked up world, everyone screams for their rights, and are getting them, but for those who are suffering, they can't choose to die humanly. People don't give a fuck about the homeless, those that are depressed, suffering with mental illness, if you are living in poverty, even though you work hard and do your best, they look down on you if you are just a cleaner. Welfare agencies don't give a fuck if your suffering and can't go on, there is no support for you, while others bludge off the system and get away with it for years and years.
The risk of surviving a gun shot wound, if its not done right, and obviously how to hang oneself is can not work and cause prolonged damage, as I found out. We need assitance to do so safely, Humanely without the need for other people to discover you with pieces everywhere, or at the bottom of a cliff.
This world is FUCKED and upside down"
Can�۪t catch my breath,"I just can�۪t catch up anymore from my depression and stress. Everyone has left me and I�۪m just ready. No one asks me how I am. No one cares. I�۪m swallowed in debt, no one to talk to, work has cut my hours to little to nothing. Really could use some advice in private if someone could help. "
"I don't want to die, I just don't want to work 40 hours","I plan to end my life soon, just because I can't seem to find a job that I'm willing to do for the majority of my life. I wouldn't mind working at most places 4 or even 6 hours a day, but 8 hours just seems like more than I can handle. I think that if i could find a job that payed enough for just 6 hours a day, I might be able to keep going, but these don't seem to exist."
Simultaneously giving all the fucks and no fucks at all,"Don't know if anyone is here right now.  Don't have the energy to ramble. I don't know man. Like my title said, I'm just out if the energy to care, but at the same time I'm scared of everything. Don't know what to do. "
What can I do about isolation?,"My biggest source of pain and depression is loneliness. I don't have friends, I don't have supportive/loving family. I'm bad with people. I can't get close to or matter to anyone. What can I do to not feel this pain/be affected by being completely alone? "
Experience with Antidepressants? Best and worst?,"I was put on Paxil back in 2005. It was absolutely horrible. A lot of side effects and very addictive. It took me almost a year to ween myself off of it, and there are even more side effects trying to get it out of your system.I�۪m now on Trintellix. Been using it for almost 3 months and so far it has been a good experience. No major side effects besides a little nausea at first.My wife had a terrible time on Zoloft. It seemed to make her postpartum depression worse and she would have really bad episodes of anxiety.What have you all tried and what has worked or didn�۪t work for you?"
I don't have any friends at all,I'm a community college student and if I don't make friends next semester at uni I'm calling it quits... life is too damn miserable having zero people to talk to. Everything I do in my life is pretty much become a secret. And my secrets are multiplying by the day . Most of them bad . I can't help but wonder if anyone would care if I just killed myself . I mean if I were to do it right now I may not be found for over a day . Maybe longer . Nobody would notice
I don't know what to do with my life,"I'm 18 and right after I graduated high school (literally graduation night) I was kicked out of my house which I was being emotionally abused in and now I'm living over 100 kilometres away from my friends and anyone I care about, she held all the stuff I owned there hostage and it took all my saving I had to get it back, I'm sleeping on a cot in my grandfathers basement with 2 other siblings and my stuff gets taken by them daily to the point where I have no socks and no money to buy more. My mom being the manipulative person she is managed to pin all my friends parents against me and I lost a few friends from that and now I couldn't feel more alone, I have no one to talk to and all this built up anger, I know it's not healthy but it's getting to me and I just really want this to be over."
Help me,"I need help. I have a wife and 3 kids. I was making really good money and then invested in a business that failed dramatically. Regardless, i was always a pathetic failure of a human. I faked it til i made it cause i never knew how to be. Now I'm struggling to find myself in a life that sits so far from normality. I can't fix my financial situation without burning out and i can't take time off to fix my mindset without jeopardizing my career. What do i do? Help me!"
My wife is divorcing me and my kids hate me,I won't make through this year. No one cares that this is killing me. She's always been there and helped me. Now I've got no that understands me and accepts me. I need help
A year later,"Precisely a year ago I almost killed myself multiple times. Gave myself another year to see if things got better. And they don't, things only got worse. Made new friends, abandoned others. Thought i found love, only to find out i was saving my partner. And that was my only interest. Left my dad, moved in with my moms. I'm getting hate thoughts of my mother and i dont know why. Because i love her so much. Don't even care about my cat anymore. Sometimes i just have a moment of realisation of what i was thinking, and im like holy fuck. And it's more difficult to get out of that state of mind than it was a year ago. So i guess it got worse. I'm having a reintroduction to my psychologist soon. If i make that far. Thanks for reading."
Does going to the emergency room for suicidal thoughts actually help?,"Has anyone here actually been helped by going there?I need to hear some opinions before I actually take that step.I feel like I'm stuck being alive because hanging is my only sure option to commit suicide and I've failed at it/got cold feet twice this month and just ended up bruising and scaring my neck.My pain is to the the point where I NEED either death or medical help.One of those options are about to be taken VERY soon.That rope is still scary,but it's looking less and less scary by the day."
"My girlfriend needs help, I need advice on how to help her. (Please)","My girlfriend has started going through her depression phase again, but it seems to be alot worse than before. She has done self-harm twice this week, and I just really need advice on how to help her. I understand that she can just tell her parents, but she does not want to go down that road again with all that hospital bullcrap. Personally, I am very understanding when it comes to emotions but understanding depression is something I am still working on. "
Tonight,I think I'm going to kill my self tonight it doesn't feel like anything is ever going to get better and I suck at life killing myself seams like the best option except for the hardship it will put my loved ones through I have no other options.
Plan to suicide without loved ones knowing,"Hello, hypothetically what would be a good way to go without loved ones knowing? Much love."
"Admittedly suicidal friend, two week silence followed by sudden trip","Brass tacks:A dear friend went radio silence a couple weeks ago. She'd been struggling with PTSD since she was raped a year or two ago, and the court hearing last weekend didn't go well. A mutual friend and I planned to visit her this weekend. She told our friend that she was on a plane, going cross country, on credit. Admittedly suicidal. ""Sorry for being a wretched friend"".She told me a few times never to stop reaching out, but she may be extremely distrustful of men right now. Our sole mutual friend is in a dark place, herself, and can't safely talk to her.I'm coping with the possibilities as calmly as I can - not my first rodeo - but I don't know what else to do other than text a few kind words every one or two days. She replied with a single heart last Tuesday, otherwise a lack of feedback, justified distrust (in men), and her chronic guilt of being a ""bad friend"" is making it difficult to choose the right words.I'll be calling a suicide hotline tonight for advice. Anything else in the meantime?Edit: I just clued in that the trip might be a lie and she could be gone. Will continue as if it's true."
I said September and I meant it.,I've broken too many promises in life. I'm keeping this one.
Klonopin and Vodka,"ive spent the past 30 min researching how painful it is to die from this combination i tried so hard to make studies work in europe. spent years working for it. and all i accomplished there was , panicking while my dog got sick across the ocean, losing friends, heartbreak, drinking to excess and getting harassed at a gay bar. now im back home and it feels 2 years of my life ive suffered for have led me back to this. i guess im typigthis because i want attention. no point trying to hide it. i feel completely alone and ijust want to feel like my words are being heard by someone or something even if just one stranger sees this, because the more i stay here embroiled in my own thoughts, the more terrified of myself I get, thinking about the things i want to do to myself."
My reason for not killing myself is kind of silly...,"Most people's reason for not killing themselves is probably because they have kids or a pet and they need to take care of them, or their family or friends would miss them, but not me.  MY reason is because it would hurt, or otherwise be very uncomfortable.  I know, it's dumb.You know what else is dumb?  I go to a great school, have a nice two-story house with a swimming pool in the backyard, a laptop, a 3DS, parents who love me, and a friend and boyfriend who are some of the kindest people I've ever met, but I'm depressed and suicidal.I guess I should also tell you WHY I'm suicidal.  I have Aspergers, which I absolutely hate.  I also have really bad ADHD.  Both get in the way of life.  I'm also an annoying little crapsicle.  So I guess that's why I'm suicidal."
Wishing was dead need jail no help,I'm so ready to kill myself nothing left to live for no friends to help me or be with me. Was assualted by my ex boyfriend friend that came to visit and lost everything practically in my life. I lost someone who meant alot to me despite the domestic violence I gone through. I can't handle this pain anymore and the security I need doesn't exist for whatever reason. I'm just made fun of for needing a jail cell. To be locked down and for needing to have a small space to be chained down in. I think that it's time I kill myself since there nothing left living and the people I fall for just take advantage of me and hurt me.
My mind goes blank whenever I try to list lives in which I'm a genuine factor for non-selfish reasons.,"I'm just sat here at this random chair at this random table outside, wondering why I didn't just suck it up and step off the CTA platform earlier."
My bf keeps stopping me and Its pushing me closer,"Ive got my benzos, ive got my wine but he keeps pinning me down, throwing away MY BENZOS and locking me in the house. Im so trapped. Now I have to do it when he falls asleep. This will likely be my last post. Goodnight and good luck "
Feeling lonely and a little panicky,"I just received some info that I don't know how to feel about, and I feel really lonely because I don't know who to talk to about it. Should I message my friends? I don't want to be a burden by complaining about my problems again, I've probably annoyed them enough by now.I wish I had a best friend. Well, I do, but we haven't really talked and I don't know if I can talk to him about my problems out of the blue. Online friends and he's been busy lately.Edit; messaged a good friend I promised I won't bother with my problems anymore, but she says she'll support me no matter wha so i guess im good. been a while since i cried haha"
Need to find a method that leaves no trace at all behind.,"Why would you want to leave no trace?If it's because you want to completely erase yourself, you won't be able to do that, because there will still be a trace in peoples' memories of you"
i need help,hi i need help i was cyberbullied. someone lured me online. it was a joke. im going to kill myself.
The grass is always brown,"I�۪ve always been curious about death, what it�۪s like to fade out, if anything truly happens after, if there is nothing and living is all there is I want to experience literal nothingness, in high school I was constantly in a state of depression and self harming, I would make deep cuts on my thighs, the pain felt like scratching an itch I couldn�۪t reach and watching the flow of blood run down my legs and onto the shower floor was an over calming And intoxicating, I started dating and freshman year became sexually active, the scars and open wounds were embarrassing keeping me from doing much with women which turned a lot of them away but one stayed, the first time she saw my scars she asked about them with a scared look on her face, I didn�۪t reply I was frozen, she pushed her soft lips to my scars kissing them and telling me it was okay and I fell in love I then decided to quit self harm and months later turned to drugs to ���self medicate�۝ so to speak. I graduated high school and worked at a pizza place and made some close friends, especially with my shift leader who also would sell me marijuana, I would work off the clock for him to improve labor cost and in return he would give me a discount and or give me a free pitcher of beer. A few weeks later our manager found out somehow I was stealing alcohol and it turns out the same person giving it to me turned me in for it, it was my word over his and I didn�۪t want to make him to lose his job so I said nothing and quit. Arround the same time I was also going through a lot at home, my fathers an alcoholic and physically/ verbally abusive. My mother found out I was smoking marijuana and kicked me out. I was jobless and homeless so I would stay with my girlfriend and other friends or just sleep in my truck at the river. My girlfriend of 4 years went off to college and decided my baggage was to much she needed a break and wasn�۪t willing to talk it out. Jobless homeless and girlfriendless. I bounced arround girl to girl place to place, put large amounts of drugs through my system trying to feel somthing other than sobriety when I was sober I was depressed. One day I decided I needed out and wanted to better my life so I signed a military contract, a few weeks befor I was going to ship to bootcamp my ex texted me begging for me back, I was nowhere near over her and took her back with no hesitation, I felt good I felt like my life was turning arround she asked if I had sex with anyone when we were apart and when I said yes and she hadn�۪t it made me feel like I had cheated I feel guilty for having sex while we were apart and I don�۪t understand it, I went to bootcamp and 3 months later I�۪m a marine I had broken my foot in basic so I was put into a medical platoon and it felt like purgatory, doing nothing all day for another 6 months and suffering the consequences of other people�۪s mistakes the thoughts and depression I hadn�۪t felt months quickly came back, fast forward im now a year and a few months in I�۪m currently in my final stage of training befor I get to my permanent duty (job) station. I thought joining would improve my mental state, giving me a purpose and somthing to do, keeping me occupied but I haven�۪t been more depressed, me and my now fianc̩ are doing great we have our small disputes but nothing major, my parents couldn�۪t be prouder of me and welcome me with open arms but I can�۪t help but feel like shit, I hate my life, I hate living, I�۪m arrround hundreds of people every day, I train with them, I talk with them occasionally but I can�۪t help but feel so alone and far from the people I love, I truly don�۪t think I can keep going and I feel like a bitch more or less for feeling this way when they�۪re is people who have been to combat and seen things I can�۪t imagine that have the right to feel this way I don�۪t know what�۪s wrong with me o can�۪t talk to anyone about it or it�۪ll be reported and I�۪ll be stuck in holding for even longer and I don�۪t want to scare my family so I can�۪t talk to them, I don�۪t know what to do and I�۪m slowly pushing my loved ones away, i don�۪t want to live anymore I feel like I�۪ve made the worst mistake of my life the only way out is to do somthing and be discharged which would disappoint everyone I love so I�۪m trapped I�۪m not sure why I�۪m posting this I guess I just need to get it off my chest."
Ughhh,"Ugh I feel so fucking awful. She was such a great person but now I feel like she fucking hates me. I don't know if she does but I feel like she really dislikes, I honestly didn't talk to her for a week. Ugh it hurts so much to think that I did something wrong to her. She was my only friend since my other 2 friends left for university. I'd honestly kill myself if I had something to do it with but for now I'm just going to suffer until I can actually do it. "
I like the idea of being 25 years old,"I'll be surprised if someone reads this, much less responds to this post...Anyway, I have decided to go through with suicide and have made my plans, vowed to myself and plan on retaining my commitment to suicide until I'm 25 years old. ""Why aren't you going to kill yourself tonight or tomorrow...or sometime soon?"" This may be a question that briefly occupies your mind, maybe not but its certainly a question that occupied my mind for some time. The answer I have may seem weird or contradictory, but I figured I would share it since this would be the first/last time I will share it and because I'm wondering if someone else out there feels the same way or maybe someone canceled their plans of suicide doing the method in the answer I'll be describing.So, the reason why I'm waiting until I turn 25 to commit suicide is to see if I can make some of my ambitions/dreams come true. I would like to try my best for a good, or at least stable enough job to let me maintain a small apartment by myself. Be able to provide for myself and become truly independent. Strive to finish my schooling and get the degree I'm working towards, even perhaps getting the ideal career I want. Then, let's say I accomplish these goals by the time I'm 25; I would still plan on killing myself. But at least I could do so with the knowledge that I tried to do something with my life. It's becoming increasingly difficult to continue forward with an almost 24/7 agonizing, lonely and emotionally tormented hell constantly being a presence in my life. I hate how my world has become so gray and dull to the point where everything I do has to be an act. Especially at this point in my life, I'm only acting for myself to attempt to convince/lie to myself that there is some reason to be happy with my life... some reason to keep moving forward. I don't see myself finding such a reason to want to keep going on. Which is I'm here, typing this post. There's definitely more to say but I can't find the energy to actually finish right now. So, thank you for reading this weird, lengthy af wall of text that I've been burying inside myself for many years. "
Bye.,I don't know how many days will be enough days. But I'm done and it'll be soon.
There's no way out,"Not anymore.
I don't have rent and todays the last day of the month. On top of that, I need to somehow get another hundred. I have no job, no car, no future. Time is up. There's no way out of this. I've let everyone down. They don't deserve thisI've been put in a psych ward before for suicide plans. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, dermatillomania, and ptsd. I was on medication, but stopped. I used to cut, but was threatened to be sent back if I ever did again. It was the only thing that brought me down though. Now I have nothing. I am not able to find comfort in anything. Things that brought me joy now bring only apathy and dread. I've had therapists. Only one was good, the others were jokes. The only good one worked in the ward and had no outpatient opportunities.I try and have tried to push myself away from it so much, but every day is like a dagger pushing farther and farther in. I have no way out from any of this anymore. Nothing helps. Nothing gets better. I've been battling depression and suicide since I was a child. My boyfriend has a gun. I want to use it. But I can't imagine his pain if he found that I used his gun to end it. He doesn't deserve that. I don't deserve him. I want better for him, I want him to have someone who isn't depressed all the time, who isn't suicidal. I know it must be incredibly stressful for him. If I'm gone, the hurt will only be for a little while. Then he can move to better opportunities. "
I keep ruining things,And I keep having to cut myself because I make life uneasy for everyone else.
"I was supposed to go to school yesterday, because I had a test","But I took a train and went to a park on the other side of the city. I felt much more relieved.
So, how are you guys doing?"
Just got fired. Have no options left.,Just got fired from my job. It was my fault I deserve it. The second time for the same thing. I can�۪t face my family. Not again.
I just hurt myself. Regretful and scared...,I purposefully slammed my head against a door after trying to drink a bottle of medicine a few hours ago. I did not feel anything through all the crying but now a few hours later I am in a lot of pain. My head hurts in several different areas except for the part that was actually hit. I've been  able to google on head trauma and write this.. I am very scared about what consequences may come.
I am really not feeling ok. I want to talk to someone who has felt similar to me,"I posted here a while ago.  But honestly my issues are just getting worse.  I genuinely genuinely believe I am the ugliest guy I know.  I cannot bear to even look at myself in the mirror.... and videos/pictures are horrifying.I'm 24, live with three other guys.  They all have girls regularly.  I haven't had sex in 3 years.People say subtle things about my looks all the time.  Like I'm ""goofy"" or ""look like a cartoon character"" which seems simple at the time but it CRUSHES my self esteem.I don't like going out anymore because I have zero self esteem.  I spent the last 30 minutes taking videos of myself just to confirm I'm ugly.  The one side of my face is literally deformed and looks ridiculous.I had a girlfriend for 2 years 2 years ago and she was incredible and was the only thing that made me happy.  People told me she was far out of my league all the time.  She left me of course.I just don't know what to do.  I wake up every day feeling soooo uncomfortable in my own skin.  I've slowly realized over time that I truly am a really ugly person.  Without a doubt.  To be honest I just don't really want to live anymore.  Other people are always having fun when I'm suffering in my own skin feeling uncomfortable.  I can only do this for so much longer.  I just don't want to live out the rest of my life.  I've been terrified of suicide but as I live each day, I grow a little more miserable and one more step closer to finally doing it.There's NOTHING I can do to fix the way I look.  This is me.  I hate myself."
Talk tonight,Can anyone talk to me for a bit?I'm not feeling well.
There's genuinely nothing for me. I feel numb. Nothing I want to do works out. I feel like I'm cursed.,"I dont even know where to start so im just going to lay it all out on the tableI dont have a family life to care aboutI lack the interest in love, always have, not just because of depressed, so no wife/girlfriend, etc. everI dont want kidsI almost died when I was younger, leaving me with stunted growth and many disabilities, preventing me from ever having a regular job, as Im pretty much disabled, no one will hire meI cant get better at any of my video games, Ive been practicing every day for the last 5 years on various games im very passionate aboutI have no interest in making friends because ive had the worst luck when it comes to friends, liars, users, etc. so thats also not a priorityI just feel like nothing I ever have a passion to do (which is rare) ever works out, no matter how hard I work for itWhat do I even do, this isnt irrational, so please dont tell me it gets better or anything, im being logical here"
I want to slit my wrists tonight,"I'm so lonely
I don't wanna be here alone anymore
rejection
rejection
rejection
rejection
fuck you"
Another day,"That ""you are not depressed, you are just making this up to gain some attention, because this is the internet"" by some. And the ""usually by then you should be used to work training because you need to be used to the fact that sooner or later you'd leave the comfort zone"" and getting lectured on what sacrifice isthry never knew what sacrifices i did. Time check its 4:03am and honestly I don't enjoy eating cake at this time
Usually i eat a full meal.
And never think of what happened in the past
And cry badlyBUT ITS HAPPENING and its getting worst as weeks go by "
My life is pointless,I'm going to be homeless in 48 hours because my mom stop paying rent and moved to do IHSS suddenly and left everything up to my brother and me and my brother doesn't do shit.She took the car I've been paying on that she cornered me to even buy and never taught me how to drive. Now they want to put a house in my fucking name. I won't. But now since she only told us a week ago we need to find a new place since evictions... Idk what to do. I'm not stable. I just started seeing my therapist last week but she hasn't texted me about my new schedule. Nobody cares anymore I feel like I'm just being used ill never be happy I've tried so hard and everything I touch crumbles. I even miss my ex Yuki T. But I fucked it up by holding his cheating on him even after we tried to be friends I had a dream about him last night and I can't shake it. Right now we are packing apartment and we have no electricity. I just I know I'm not making sense at all. I just I just ifk broken I'm done in tired of this world this has constantly been my life and I'm tired of living I really am I know I say this before but nobody is home and I'm going too do it I rather be dead than continue in this shit world
What is the best way to go?,"I've always thought it would be panadol overdose but after doing some research I've learned it could take up to a week before I actually die and it's not painless., any suggestions? "
I'm not really sure if I'm suicidal,"Hi I'm not going to share my name but I'm a college student who's going to graduate very soon and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Originally I wanted to be an English teacher, but I didn't get into my college's teaching program since my co-op teacher didn't give me a fair chance. She was looking for flaws from the second I walked into the room, I honestly don't think there was anything I could have done. After it happened I decided that I would just pursue my English degree and learn how to be happy with just that. I knew I was lying to myself, but now I know for sure that I regret that decision. I wanted to be a teacher because I saw it as a way to help people, people like me, people who suffer. Helping people is the only thing I've ever been passionate about in my entire life, and an English degree won't help me do that. I've looked at the options for what a person with an English degree can do and none of them mean anything to me. Any idiot can edit a paper, any idiot can write an article. I won't be making a difference, so what's the point? I could have changed my major, but I didn't want to put my family through that, I'm already in debt and they've been helping me pay and if I were to change it, it would have only caused them more debt and more grief. Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just end it now and get it over with."
I Hope I Fucking Die Today.,"The luckiest thing that could possibly happen to me today would be a brain aneurysm. Healthy people get them, so why can't I? It's not like I give a shit about being alive anymore so why can't my brain just help me give up already. Or maybe if something could just fall on me and crush me. That'd be nice, before I plan on doing something myself. My life is going nowhere, I don't want to see what it will be like 5 or 10 years from now because it doesn't matter. I'm a worthless being with no purpose in this world."
No one gives a fuck about me i think id be better off dead,"hey im an 18 year old with  a tbi and chronic pain i feel like no one gives a flying fuck about me, everyone i talk to says its in your head, its in your head just calm down WELL HOW THE FUCK DO I FIX MY HEAD WITH MY HEAD WHEN ITS ALREADY BROKEN, i tried talking to my best friend and i said that and he just fucking told me to screw it back on  wtf man."
"2 weeks from now, I'm going to say goodbye.","Apologies for the formatting and grammar errs in advance. English is not my mother tongue and I ain't no smart either.I don't know if I'll succeed this time. But I think I will. It will be painful but I promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace, endless peace. At least for me. I don't know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will I do it but yes, I'll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a ten-wheeler truck. I just can't find any other way; a gun is way too expensive and I find jumping off a bridge, from a building or by hanging being too cliche. I don't want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest I could find. At least it will guarantee my death. Enough with how I plan to end it but this is my story.I'll save you my personal information but so long as I can remember, I've been depressed and suicidal for 7 years; 6 and half to be precise since I wouldn't be here in October in anyway. I started to develop depression after I was kicked out in the Seminary. I was in Highschool Seminary and I've always wanted to serve God and become a priest but alas, I was in High School. I bullied and got bullied, it's a common standard. Albeit I befriended myself (I was on Junior High) with a Freshman. He has no friends whatsoever since he was not friendly to anybody. I can't exactly remember what started our feud but I bullied him since for his ungratefulness; I was his only friend yet he does not treat me so kindly. I can't remember how we reconciled and became friends again later on. I don't know if it was part of his master plan but since I was in High School (and a virgin), we begun perversely mocking our teachers especially our librarian. There I made an indecent letter addressed to our librarian to allow me to have sex with her, signed with a forged signature of our monsignor. He took the letter and reported me; to which I beat him up for. Few days later, the council had a meeting and decided to not allow me to enroll in the seminary for the following year. I was devastated. I pleaded badly. I sent letters to the Seminary formators and the Archbishop himself and found out the prick made a story that I had an affair with him, making my situation worse. Didn't realize I will never recover from this.Then begun my trust issues. I graduated High School in a different school with less friends than I had before. I went to College and found new friends but my trust issues later kicked in and I transferred to another school. This time, it was worse. My anxiety and trust issues were so severe I was unable to make any friends, none whatsoever. I'm in a four-year course and sadly, I'm on my sixth year now due to failing grades and tons of no-grade status. I took same courses consistently for 2 semesters while barely hanging by a thread. I had two probations, and it took me 5 semesters to finish 2 semester- CWTS/ROTC. I went 6 years in college with literally no friends. I eat alone, everyday somewhere far where nobody would recognize me. I don't hang out with anyone nor I can't remember having any decent conversation with anybody. I always find a way to avoid people even to the point of punishing myself for them to avoid me. The anxiety was so severe, I purposely don't brush my teeth nor apply deodorant just so people would avoid me. Albeit that didn't stop them from inviting me to fraternities which I politely refuse. You see, I get easily irritated like every depressed people. I may not look like one but I'm freakishly strong; probably because of pent up anger within me. I often try to channel my frustration through boxing and picking fights but that doesn't seem to satisfy me. Sex also doesn't soothe me. It's a temporary pleasure but it doesn't help me in a long-shot. I even thought I was homosexual since girls doesn't seem to satisfy me but the thought of having sex with another guy disgusts me. Never went down that road but I'm pretty sure I'm straight. Anyway, the only courses left for me next semester are seminars and On the-Job-Trainings to which I fear I won't succeed. I've never made any friends in college and envy my sister for living the life I wish I had. I love my family, I really do. This is why I've survived 7 years of suicidal depression just for them. I've hurt them before, both mentally and physically (thrice: hit my sister twice and boxed with my father which I clearly lost). I'm not proud of it, I can't control myself but they love me still. They didn't realize my condition until last year where it had gone so severe that I was barely about to hide it. I started banging my head against a wall until I pass out about 3 years ago. Every morning I cry myself out on how I was still alive, hoping I wasn't able to wake up. Every night I hope will be my last. But it never came. I tried-to many to count stupid, menial suicide attempts. I've strangled myself with a blanket, drowned myself in a pail, bought sleeping pills from the black market but all of that, I was able to resist. My body somehow instinctively survives and resists them. I remember passing out after I strangled myself with a blanket and woke up with my arms unwrapping them. I remember waking and coughing up blood in the bathroom after trying to drown myself. I remember my hair went crazy after I showered and stuck my fingers on the socket without my hands being burnt to crisps. I remember waking up after continuously banging my head on the concrete wall on my room with blood everywhere and surviving. I've always find a way for my family not to notice it. I'm quick to work on cleaning the blood stains and covering what happened. I don't want them to see any physical attempts of suicide. I even bought a neck bracer to hide the ruffs on my neck.Then I begun hearing voices. I know it's me but it feels like someone else. It wanted me to kill my family whom I loved dear. The voices were overwhelming I begun banging my head in-front of my family hoping it would stop. It concerned them so bad. Several weeks later, they overheard me singing some kind of suicide song, dizzy from continuous head banging. Later at the end of that semester, they sent me to rehab. They conspired with a psychiatrist to which I revealed everything. They drugged me, kidnapped me and had my ass on rehab. It didn't help. Rehab feels like a deterrent instead of a recovery. I stayed for a month in the facility and deterred any physical manifestations of my suicidal tendencies after I got out. I no longer bang my head on a concrete wall, I just punch the shit out of it. I boxed, so I know where to hit it.I learned from my psychiatrist I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder with extreme suicidal tendencies. Coupled with social anxiety, agora phobia, severe trust issues, anti-social personality disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and PTSD. PTSD not from a life-threatening situation but PTSD from getting kicked out of the seminary. I've met all the conditions except the first requirement.I don't want to leave my family but if I continue to live my life, I might end up doing something I regret. I don't want to hurt my family nor anyone else ever again. I'm doing myself a favor. No one is going to love someone like me. I'll save my future children some problems, I don't want them to inherent my depression. I forgot to mention I'm no longer religious. I never had God with me nor felt any divine presence ever since I acquired depression. I was all alone. Despite the family support and help, I still feel alone. And I would rather die alone. If this was karma for all the wrongs I've did, I believe this is too excessive of a punishment. If there is a good God, I don't know why my depression is part of his plan or anything. If there is hell, well, I rather be there instead of being here. I just hope they can never uncover my plan. I'm tired guys. I really am. It's selfish to commit suicide but I don't think I'll be any of good use in the future. I'll be an inconvenience. Depression made me stone-cold. I had crushes but I never felt love. Sex wasn't love, it was fun. What's sad is the only thing that keeps me alive today and wanting to live for the following years are TV-shows and movies. That's all. Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Lucifer, DBZ super, Avengers, Justice League, etc. I've watch too many shows and movies alone. The only imaginry friends I had were TBBT, HIMYM and FRIENDS. But I think none of that will matter. I won't remember anything of that when I'm dead anyway.2 week countdown from now. I'll wait for the semester to end. I'll die with fashion, wearing my favorite jeans, shoes and shirt. I'll be busy preparing my death, farewell letters and stuff. Plus, I major in Psychology. At least it will send a signal to my batchmates to start helping depressed individuals. Goodbye Reddit. I know nobody or few would bother to read this but still. Bye!"
"Making plans to kill myself, I can't succeed in anything I attempt and put effort into.","I am honestly running out of options and I feel the need to kill myself. It feels like I can't succeed at anything I try and put effort into. I am in college and struggling with half the workload that others who are in the program full time. I can't properly communicate with people due to my anxiety, with my conversations end up consisting of stuttering and scrambled sentences. I want to kill myself by the end of this year if I can't finish school, it feels like its the only thing that keeps me going despite making me depressed to the point where I can't think straight. I am on my last semester and have already tried to take a semester off to get things sorted out with my heath but in that time I ended up being unemployed and losing all my old friends from high school due to my mental health problems. After I stopped talking to them I've been trying to expand my social circle, and been trying to go out and be active in the community volunteering. I almost got into a relationship with someone but she eventually figured out about my mental health issues after she began too open up about hers and now she doesn't even talk too me. Last time I heard about her she moved on and is in a relationship like a week after she stopped talking to me. I have been seeking counseling but it hasn't been as helpful as it was when I started 6 months ago. It feels like nothing positive has happened to me this year, I'm back where I am started with school, still struggling with a part time course load, and have lost contact with all the people I used to call my friends from high school. I have no way to properly communicate and relate to the people in my classes and in the outside world and therapy hasn't been helping for awhile now. Why should I continue to try and achieve my goals when people like me are not meant to achieve them. I feel like a loser, I am making plans to kill myself in the new year if things don't go well with school, but I might do it sooner if I continue to feel the way I am now. I am going hang myself in the woods away from everyone I know so I can die alone."
I don't know who I am anymore,"That's where I'm at right now as I write this. I've been depressed for years now, but the depression this time is different, stronger. I don't really feel down, I just feel empty, drained of everything that was ever considered me. I rarely 'feel' anything anymore, or at least I no longer know how or what to feel. Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of. I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I'm obligated to. My personality is gone as well and the feelings I've had for those close to me are no longer there. When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing. I don't feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore. I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell. I mean, there are times when my legs or my hands don't feel like mine. My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day's past. Just typing this is an ordeal, constant spelling mistakes and typos.On top of all this, I have no one to talk to. I have no friends to talk to. Sure, my Facebook profile says otherwise, but I never talk to any of them online, let alone IRL. I can't even tell my family because I know all they'll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help. I mean, I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly, even with people I know quite well. I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis, but I've realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another, be it my personality and mannerisms, or just because they found something better. Some say a therapist or counselor might help, but they never have for me. The problem is myself. I'm physically repulsive. I've seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me. I mean, who wants to be seen talking to a fat, greasy, pizza faced, creeper-stache monster with a sweat problem? Even if they can get past that outer shell, what they find isn't any better. I'm a dull person. The things that interest me typically don't interest others and vice versa. My personality and interests just aren't compatible with most people. And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid, or something about me drives them away.And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience. Maybe not so much a burden, but just one of those people where others go, ""Oh, here comes THAT guy again. Quick, let's think of a reason not to hang out with him."" FFS, I even feel this way with complete strangers. When I'm crossing the road, buying groceries, riding the bus, or just simply standing around. I just get this sense that people wish I weren't there. That if I weren't, their day would be 100% better.I'm also an addict, or rather becoming one. For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos, anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain. Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile. Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking. I managed to kick those for a few months, but now I'm back at it. Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo. Anyways I feel like I'm rambling a bit. I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I'm planning on doing, it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to. I want the old me back, the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until 5am to figure out a bug in some code. And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel. Because I don't have someone to talk to, I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so. Some might say get a therapist, but I've tried in the past and it just doesn't feel genuine enough. I need a friend, not a therapist. Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school, but again, I feel like I'm such an inconvenience to them. Anyways, come Wednesday night (I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday, some final preparations) I'll finally be done with this. It's not that I'm in any sort of emotional or psychological pain, it's just that I'm tired of not feeling, tired of feeling like an empty shell. Unless a miracle happens between now and then, there's no stopping me now. I've gathered my materials and made my preparations. I'm just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest."
Derailing trains of thought,"Things always get bad in the still of night.
And I'm cold and I'm getting incoherent and I'm being paranoid and irritable and I can't get my mind to slow down. I'm thinking a thousand different things, hundreds of trains on tracks fragmenting off into oblivion. And I'm running around trying to snatch up the bits and pieces of my sanity before they fizzle out. It's making me so crazy this perpetual, frantic last ditch effort to grab these slivers of my mind. Because I'm falling apart, I'm trying not to. I'm trying to handle it but it just isn't working. I don't know what I think anymore. Maybe the truth is on one of those derailing trains of mine. But by the time I get over to the wreckage to salvage some shred of it, everything's engulfed in flames and I've got an entirely new set of thoughts dissolving away and demanding rescue. This is so insane. I'm so insane. You never realize your brakes are out until you slam on the pedal. I could really use some conversation if anyone is out there... "
I'm going to a festival on my last day alive,"I got so fucking drunk last night, was a huge embarrassment to my friends and ended up being taken home from a night out by police after i said I was feeling suicidal to my friend. Im going to a festival today, get my hands on as many drugs as i can and then take them all in one go. I hate myself and i am ready"
Unbearable Suicidal Ideation,"TL;DR everything is awful and I constantly want to die but I'm too scared of hurting my friends and family to kill myself for real. I've had suicidal ideations since I was a child. I think the first time I ever tried to kill myself,  albeit quite halfheartedly, I was 10 years old. I'm now 24, and I'm exhausted. Fighting it every day is so hard. I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid I will get to the point where it isn't just ideation anymore. I am afraid that my half hearted attempts of the past will become the real deal. I'm so filled with self hatred and anger. I know my family would be upset and that tears me apart to think about, but also the pain is so much to bear. I  just feel so awful all the time. Like I'm performing all my actions within a jar of molasses. It's always been like this to some extent, but lately it's gotten worseI don't know what to do. I guess I just want support. "
I'm done,"I'm done.  I can't do this anymore.  I know that at 15 I'm too young to make that decision, but I'm making that decision.  I can't continue to live in the world.  Goodbye."
"I'd just like someone to talk to, to take my mind off things",whats up buddy?
depressed,"can someone talk to me, i�۪m so fkin tired of everything..."
dammit,I left the study lounge to get my knife from my room but once I got back one of my dorm friends decided he would come chill with me here so I can't do anything
I know this is cliche but fuck i just want to be a kid again,"I can't take it anymore. Everything is terrible now, I just want to go back to having no responsibility or awareness of how much this world sucks. I feel sick to my fucking stomach just thinking about my childhood. I just can't do this things are just getting worse and worse the older I get"
I can't go on anymore...,"It's like there are weights on my chest. It's like the breath is leaving my lungs forcefully. It's like I'm living in a nightmare coma that I can't wake up from. And no one can help me.I am on meds (Trintellix, Rexulti, Klonopin, Seroquel) but they don't seem to be helping. I am too chicken to do ECT and no doctors will give me an MAOI.I don't feel like I can go on anymore. This is just too much. Nothing around me ever feels real. It's all a dream."
I'm done with the loneliness and repetition,"I'm not gonna sit here and say, my life sucks, wah I never get what I want, etc. But I just need to talk about this because might as well post it publically when no one that I'm friends with gives a crap. so pretty much, I thought that getting a job would help distract me from my depression but I think it got worse. First off I'm extremely lonely, there's a girl I'm interested in but I know for sure that even if I were to confess how I felt to her, it wouldn't work out because I'm a garbage human, I've been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time I've ever had a S/O was in high school, but then again she had autism so she most likely didn't care about me romantically. Then there was the other attempt I had at telling someone how I felt, and she though said that she loved me, left me to rot afterwards. So you can see where I'm getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time. There's that, and there's also that I'm an artist, and that's been dragging me down lately too, since I keep drawing but I never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice, well gee, nothing is getting better so it OBVIOUSLY ISN'T WORKING!
I'm just sick of it, I don't even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday. I know I sound bitchy and whiny, but I just want out, I might buy myself a gun if I have to just to end it. Or maybe jump off the tallest bridge here in my city"
Ex keeps trying to prevent my death,"I don't get it. I just want to die and someone who doesn't want to be with me keeps trying to make my life better. I just can't understand. I hate my life so much. I haven't done much with it except write a few stories here and there. I'm not confident in my future. I hate when people leave me because they don't think I'm right for them, even though they say I make them happy and make their life better. I'd rather make their lives better than my own. But now she says she's so committed to preventing me from killing myself. I hadn't even told her I had made plans to do it in the coming weeks. I don't want to turn 22 and I want to die instead. That would be a much happier birthday present. I just can't fathom this. Why make me feel bad for wanting to be free from pain? I don't see myself doing much in the future and all I can see myself doing is killing myself in some way. "
36 hrs later.,"It been about 36 hrs since I tried to commit suicide. (I'm not sure how to share my original post) I'm still in the hospital and I'll probably be doing 2 weeks in what they call ""mentality resort"" which I'm guessing is a nice padded white room.I just want to thank you for all the support everyone has given me. Honestly I'm sure I would've succeeded if I didn't totally forget that I invited my sister over to talk. She saved my ass hands down. All i can really do now is hope I get better.... mentally at least...."
Letting it go,"I have a date in mind to let it all go. I've been thinking about it since 2 years and finally I've come to a decision and honestly I feel better now, I'm happy that now I just have to suffer for few more days and if everything goes right I'll be free. You just can't tell people around you all these things and I wanted to just be heard so I typed it here. Its not that I never tried to get over it or do something about it but whatever I did all just backfired, I have all the positive things to say to people when they are down but for me I don't have anything and maybe I don't even need it anymore. "

"No one cares, and I just want to scream and cry and throw myself off a bridge","The world is a shitty shitty place, and despite wanting to be a part of it's shittiness, I guess I'm not cut out for it. Everyone who has ever gotten to know me has come to dislike me. I just want to fucking die and stop going through this constant cycle of tricking people into thinking I'm decent and then getting hurt when they realize I'm pathetic and leave me. It's so fucking hard and no one cares. Not a single person actually likes who I am. The best thing I get is pity. Even my family dosnt love me, they pity me. They act like they care when they are just scared I'll kill myself and make their lives more complicated than I already have. People look at me and see some poor sad thing. People have good intentions, so they do their best for the poor sad thing, but when they realize that they cant help/change me, they give up on me. I dont blame them. I dont have anything or anyone to live for. I'm more trouble than I'm worth. Why shouldn't I just disappear and kill myself? Come on, tell me internet. Show me some more fucking pity. Tell me how I just need to change my outlook, or I need to get out of the house and exercise, or how I need to love myself before others can. I've heard it all before. I dont know why the fuck I'm posting. Another pathetic cry for help I guess. "
"Because I'm a loser virgin in his mid 30's, I will do the world a favor and die","Even through people here may say otherwise, I will do people a favor by killing myself very soon. I am an absolute loser. I work a low paid job, failed school because I'm a retard, and I've not had a single friend in my entire life. I'm also in my 30's.I tried dating but was made fun of and women especially made my life shit growing up. They will be glad to hear I've finally removed myself from the world. I don't blame them to be honest.I've been in different types of therapy for years now and nothing has made even one second more bearable. I must  die to ensure nobody has to acknowledge my disgusting existence anymore. The only kind thing for me to do is to die, and make sure that I cause myself pain while doing so for my disgusting existence. Trust me, people who knew me as a child had a right to treat me like shit, for I was a loser pathetic piece of shit myself. Why treat a worthless turd anything better than what he is? I'm glad everybody I knew treated me like garbage because I am garbage so it's how I should be treated. People have even told me before to kill myself. I agree. I just wish I could cause myself the pain they wanted before I die.Why shouldn't I end my life?"
I can't take anymore,"Idk
What to do anymore .. Pretty sure tonight is gonna be the night . I'm
Transgender  and my family is extremely against that ,
I also struggle with severe mental illness . My depression is so bad I feel like I'm drowning , and I hear voices that talk to me and say awful things ..
I'm sorry to sound so
Negative but I keep it inside all rn time
And I think I've finally broken . I feel so so bad for the people I'll leave behind , but I can't do
This anymore . Even my own family
Dosent care enough to
Truly listen and try to
Understsnd . What hope is there ?"
I�۪m ready to do it right now,"I want to so bad, I need to, but something keeps stopping me, right now I think maybe I can. I�۪m in the right mindset to think about the reasons I want to and not the reasons I don�۪t.And then there we go, as I�۪m writing this my mom texted me to ask what I want on my birthday cake. Stop making me think of you, I just want to go. Please please someone make this stop please anyone or anything"
im just... done,"i literally think about killing myself almost every day, its non stop. people that are my friends have told me that its a ""chore to hang out with me"" its like they only do it because they feel some obligation to. i need people around me or at least to talk to me. im not an introvert in any sense of the word, but im not in a position to go out and meet new people, besides they would just tell me the same things everyone else ive ever met has said. ""you talk to loud"" ""you talk to much"" ""you never shut up"" "" your way to hyper"" even when i do meet new people, no one ever just understands me and it eventually becomes a chore to be around me and i just cant take it anymore. i tied a belt around my neck today and got it stuck between my door and the frame just to feel what it would be like to actually do it, and i wasnt disappointed, while it was around my neck i just felt this relief falling over me, and after taking it off i just want to do it... i dont know what to do.... im 21 and ive never really felt happy or content with my life, never did good in school, all my family members are doing so well and im at the bottom of the barrel, ive reached my end, idk if tonight is the night, or maybe tomorrow, but im half way through a bottle of vodka and i think ive finally reached my breaking point, i just moved and met up with someone i knew a couple years ago, (we were best friends then) and he drove out a couple hours away with some other people i just met and they didnt invite me or talk to me about it, they kept it hidden from me, which im guessing is because as always im just a chore to be around, ive tried to change who i am, and i just cant... i just cant. maybe tonight will be the perfect night to finally do it."
Is it worth killing myself if I'm trans?,"I'm not going to be fucking trans.  I spent every day in high school imagining this girl that was me doing the same things I did.  I'm not going to be a disgusting freak for the rest of my life.  Once dysphoria becomes too much, I'll probably just end it. "
I don't have any friends. I am mentally worn out and just tired of how things seem to be going in my life. Help?,"I just want my life to be somewhat normal.  I don't have the ability to talk to a therapist right now, due to insurance problems, so I am pretty isolated.  My ""friends"" (who I was never really close to in the first place, although I'm only just realizing how thin our connections were) have moved on with their lives and I'm just here alone.  I don't even bother to go on Facebook anymore because I don't care to see their new lives; it no longer matters to me.Suicidal thoughts still go through my head on a near-daily basis.  Never a plan, just the thought of holding a gun to my head and pulling the trigger or something else like hanging.  Just fantasies, I guess.I keep coming here since I joined the community of Reddit; it's like a drug, it keeps me grounded enough to be marginally okay.  Being me is no picnic, that's for sure."
"Like seriously, What is the point, This world is unbelievable shit, Everyone would fuck over everyone else for a little bit of money, why would anyone want to bring kids up on this shitty planet.","I didn't ask to be born. In my opinion, having children is immoral, because this planet sucks. I support VHEMT."
Is it normal to be suicidal multiple times?,"I've felt extremely suicidal for months at a time at least four times in my life, to the point where I start making plans, and then it goes away. I guess because it's usually school that triggers it for me, and the semester eventually ends. This has been happening every few years since middle school. Is there something wrong with me? I feel like everyone else can handle the stress by either just doing well or just not caring too much when they fail. I just start digging a hole where I get so behind in every class I can hardly pass them and want another way out. I guess this was a little ranty, but I just wish there was a way to stop feeling so bad all the time. "
Last week I lost the best girl I ever had,"Three years ago we met,  I was an alcoholic at the time but she managed to see the best in me.  We went on and off for two years till we finallu dated just last year. Through our relationship,  I woukd drink and we would fight.  I never put her first and I was just an idiot.  Last week she moved everything out. She's finally had enough of my bullshit and so have I. I ruined the best thing to ever happen to me,  and every morning and night all I think about is getting away...  I'm trying to get better,  with AA and trying to sort out my emotional lrovlems but I'm worried without her I'm destined to fail.  I loved her so much,  and now I have nothing and I just want to die... "
oh hey here I am making another post that will be ignored,"You've all heard it before.  I'm sad, I feel like a disappointment, a waste of space.  I'm a pathetic loser who failed high school and can barely handle a job.  I'm never fucking good enough for anyone, not even myself.  yadayadayada.There's no point in me making this post.  The suicidal thoughts are there every single day and they never go away.  Not a day goes by that I don't think about it."
I want to end my life; but I don't want to end it in a painful way. I also don't want my family to cry.,"I am very ugly. I have deep craters on my face, and bad acne that is extremely hard to manage. I am a 27 year old virgin and I don't see my prospects of making friends or finding a girlfriend nearing towards a positive outcome.I'm stuck in a job i hate: I'm a mascot for two universities. The only time anyone ever wants to be around me is when I'm the mascot. Otherwise, they want nothing to do with me, nor do they notice me. I am merely an obstacle in everybody's path.My family loves me, which makes this hard. If I were to commit suicide, then I would leave them behind with my debt, and tons of pain. If I could find an easy way to end my life - I would; like taking some sort of magic suicide pill, so I could slip back and let the world take me away.The only thing that keeps me occupied is my guitar. I'm not even good at it, but I enjoy playing it, but who would want to see or listen to somebody ugly play the guitar? If I had that pill; right now I'd take it."
Does it get worse later in the day for anyone else,"It seems like the later I stay up, I hate myself more. Maybe it's being tired, I don't know. I should sleep. I love seeing my cats after coming home, they love me.I want to talk to someone but I keep it in because I don't want to annoy people. "
My therapist sucks. I've went through too many and I'm tired of looking for a new one. Afraid when next crisis happens nobody will be able to help and something bad happen. Psychiatrists didn't help. Tips? Anyone feel the same way?,I don't want to end therapy with my current therapists because I want to stick with her for eight weeks instead of quitting. But she's expensive AF like most.My therapist sucks. I've went through too many and I'm tired of looking for a new one. Afraid when next crisis happens nobody will be able to help and something bad happen. Psychiatrists didn't help. Tips? Anyone feel the same way?
Can�۪t,"I can�۪t do it, everytime i try too i don�۪t. Even though I know there�۪s just pain waiting, and another attempt, I still never do it. Why?"
Idk wtf to do,"It's every day, I have no drive anymore, I'm scared, and a bullet sounds better than this"
Finally Prepared To End It,"I've been flirting with the idea of suicide for years now, and I think I'm finally ready. My college caught me dealing drugs, so I've been expelled, and I don't know what else is left in my life. It's all ruined. I used to be this perfect smart kid with a 36 on the ACT who graduated as his high school's valedictorian, but now I'm another scummy low-level drug dealer. Many of my former close friends have abandoned me, and my parents tell me I'm tearing the whole family apart. I don't see any positive outcome to the rest of my life anymore. I've fucked it all up irreversibly.  This isn't impulsive--I've attempted twice before, and now I have a real reason other than just hating myself. I may as well do it. --()"
I wonder,"I always want to ask people if they would attend my funeral. It doesn't really matter if they do or not, I am just curious. It sounds like I'm directly saying
""I'm going to kill myself right this instant"" so I don't, but i want to ask even when im not feeling 100% suidical just so I know. And sometimes i feel like they should know its probably going to happen someday so they should think about whether or not they would attend, and come to the terms I may die someday in the near future.And if they said they would I ask them not to bring up this or that.It's a little bit different than wondering if they care about you. Especially if it's people you haven't talked to in a while. And it's not the same as asking for help either."
I'm a burden,I don't contribute anything I just take and take and take. That's what my stepdad said. It's so true. I just take what I can get and survive. I don't give anything. I don't deserve a life. All I do is take away from the universe.
I thought I was okay,"I got a job, a beautiful place to live, had a great relationship. I'm losing my job and can't find a new one. I'm just not good at anything anymore. I am tired of fighting. I am disgusting. I wake up and the first thing I think of is shooting myself in the brain stem. I haven't been able to get out of bed in weeks now and my job is gone. I have a degree in a field thirsty for workers yet can't find anything. I'm no good for no one nowI can't talk to anyone about my problems or my childhood. All my friends diedI am posting here because I know I should be but maybe this is just a formality. I've typed out my note ten times already. Sorry for taking up your time. I am glad there is a place like this to exercise my thoughts "
my life is a waste,"I�۪m not really sure how much information is generally acceptable in these posts but since I�۪m feeling this way for a lot of reasons I think it�۪d be easiest to start with some background. I�۪m twenty years old and in my third year of college and I haven�۪t done anything meaningful with my life. I�۪ve been ostracized by peers for as long as I can remember and I�۪m trapped in a cycle of social anxiety that prevents me from being anything more than acquaintances with others. I can�۪t get a job���I can�۪t even get volunteer positions���and I live with my parents and am financially dependent on them. I feel like calling me a ���loser�۝ would be generous.I�۪m also struggling because I recently came out to my family and some relatives haven�۪t taken it as well as I�۪d expected; one of them became very abusive until I backed off and basically retracted what I had said earlier about my identity. Before this, I�۪d been hoping to join lgbt groups on campus but now I feel like it would set people off (and most of the people I�۪ve met in the community are a lot more outgoing than I am, and I feel really out of place).I honestly don�۪t feel like a ���person�۝ and I have nowhere to turn for support. All I can think about is hanging myself and after at least ten years of feeling isolated and almost constantly suicidal I feel like I�۪m finally reaching a breaking point.Sorry this got so long."
My mom is the only person in the world who would care if I died.,"Everyone always leaves, despite what they say. I'm always begging for people to care, but no one even cares. "
I am done,"I am trying to put this together, holding back tears. I am 35 years old today, probably half way through the life span I have. I haven't had any problems or difficulties that most other people have. I had a stable family growing up, youngest among siblings. I was bullied by a brother occasionally growing up, but I don't think he meant any harm. My college tuition was taken care of, I have had a well paying job in tech since the last 15 years. I have had a stable job throughout my career, and probably have a million or so in all my investments and savings. I am trying to think of reasons why I hate my life, but I can't come up with any. I haven't had any of the problems that others in this subreddit have experienced. I am probably the exact opposite of some of you, the person that everyone hates.Yet here I am. I don't really speak to my parents or brothers. It's been years since I have spoken to either one. Today is my birthday, I realized that not a single friend of mine cares. I am sitting in the dark typing this out, while I look at my phone, silent as ever. No one knows I exist, no one wants to go out for a party, and no one wants to wish me a happy birthday. I don't know how I reached here, but I don't have any friends of my own. I haven't been able to hang on to a girl since forever. I don't even know why I am this way. I never used to be this person. I used to have friends, a social circle. I used to laugh, I used to care, I use to be passionate about work. Now, I've hit halfway point of my life, and I can't fucking go through another 35 years of the hell I am right now in. Sometimes it's wiser to bow out rather than stretch through eternity in pain. I think I have made up my mind. I don't see any point of living through this. None of you know me, and I know none of you will miss me. Goodbye. It's hard to explain why I am doing this, and I think my parents will be heart broken when they know about it. To anyone reading this after the fact and trying to make sense of what I did, do realize that this was my decision. I've given it thought, I've given it time. This is the only way out for me. I am sorry if I hurt you. I am sorry for everything. Goodbye."
"Please tell me what to do, anyone. I'm begging. Please.","Sorry for bad typing, I'm crying so hard I can't see good.
I've had a bad life, diagnosed with depression anxiety at 11. I have a lot of health problems and mental problems I'm 21 now, I lost everything and all I had was my boyfriend and he was feeling suicidal so he checked himself into a beavhioral health center, and now I have no one. He made my schedule, he told me what to do, he put things and life in line for me and made it livable. He loves me and helps me everyday. But. Now he is gone for at least 3 days and I don't know what to do w it's muself. I literally can't explain it I just don't know what to do. My dad is sitting here who I live with calling some lady to have her kick me out in 24 hours for smoking pot. This al started a day before yesterday when we had a fight and my bf and I yelled at dad for drinking with his morphine with klonopin and telling him to shut up when he does that because he gets mean, argument escalated and he called the police saying we beat him up so bf and I just left. All yesterday and today when we went back home dad was threading to kick us out yelling at and bf and him. We're good friends before this and this hurt bf a lot so he checked himself into some where last night after going to the hospital  and the hospital got mad and had security make me leave because I freaked out and started crying and yelling and had an full out autistic meltdown tantrum swearing yelling crying now I'm alone at home and dad is here threading me and saying the lady is going to the court right now from dcf to get me evicted in 24 hours for smoking pot, then I won't have anywhere to go with my dog and my cats, the only thing. Have left.  I'm lazy, I don't have a job, I never finished high school, I do nothing at all ever. I'm a waste of space on this earth and make a burden for others everywhere I go and everything I do I screw up.  I'm having so many thoughts of ways to kill myself I have my medicinebucket next to me I have rope in the shed my dads car goes fast and the only thing that's stopping me is  m afraid of pain and my bf being sad and alone but that fear is going away because I took a little bit extra of my anxiety meds to help me calm down but it isn't helping if anything it's making me more calm with the thought of dying.  And if I die right now he's in the right place to get treatment for depression mourning suicide ect.
I want to be with him I want to be with my only support my bf but I can't.
I don't know if I'll keep getting more content with the thought of dying today. I just hate everything, I can't even put it into words what's going through my head or what i wanttodo.
Please tell me what to do an help me"
Uh,Need someone to talk to please message me.
I want to die,"I am a junior high student, I go to a private school where everyone hates me, my parents won't let me leave the school, my older brother constantly beats me and takes my stuff, my senior parents favor him over me, they tell me it was my fault for getting beaten up for asking for my phone back last night, I ran away 3 days ago, and they just found me and took me back home, I want to die but I don't want to kill myself, I am constantly made fun of for being 6""3. I come back everyday, study and cry myself to sleep,
My dad also talks to women behind my mothers back, I literally wouldn't shed a tear if they were all taken away from me."
i can almost cry on command now.,all i have to do is stop pretending that my life isn't absolutely worthless and i can't even stop myself from crying. i feel like the highlight of my day every day is crying. it's the only time i truly feel like myself. i do it so much it just feels natural. i hope i get shot in the street tomorrow. i don't want to cry anymore.
HOW CAN ANYTHING MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?!??!,I want to die still. I am very upset. Nothing anyone says can make me feel better because NO ONE is willing to be HERE WITH ME. No one in the whole world is will or able to sit with me. I DON'T TALK TO PEOPLE ANYMORE AND I HATE MY LIFE AND NO ONE LOVES ME AND I WANT TO DIE PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME FEEL BETTER!!!!!!
"No self worth, wide has crushed me","So after 11 years of me being disappointed with our sex life, my wife told me she has never been sexually attracted to me.Over the years she's had reasons for not wanting sex, but everytime those reasons are resolved she adds more reasons. This isn't about just having an orgasm, it's about a lack of connection.Anyway I'm completely reliant on her financially as my mental health deteriorated over the years.I've got nothing left. Death greets me warm, now I will just say good bye"
I'm not really sure what to do anymore.,"I've been trying to get SSI since 2014 based on my mental health problems, but just got a letter showing the judge denied me. They literally sent me pages and pages of evidence my doctors sent in. I was pretty much denied because I felt well enough to go to an anime convention one time so it means I'm well enough to hold down a full time job. I'm just not really sure what to do at this point. I was hoping to be approved so that I could stop being a burden on the people around me, but that didn't happen. Also once I got approved I planned on coming out to everyone as transgender so that I could avoid being kicked out onto the street for being different than my family. But now that I feel that I can't do that I feel like I have to keep these overwhelming feelings inside for even longer and it makes me feel like shit. So I have no idea where my life is going, I have severe depression/bipolar disorder keeping me from being able to hold down a job and I'm a closeted trans/bi person. Everyday I find myself romanticizing the idea of suicide and how it would be an end to all my problems. I know that it would hurt my family and friends, but I keep getting closer and closer to the point where I don't care anymore. Eventually I feel like I'm going to break and then that will be that. I already have two methods chosen. Either hanging in the woods near my place, or throwing myself over the overpass before or after a doctor's appointment near where my psych doc is located.I'm not sure what I even plan on getting out of this thread. I just need to type stuff right now. Like I've said multiple times, I just don't know what to do anymore. "
I'm trying to but i just can't.,"I have everything I need, but I can't do it... Why can't I do it? I hate life, I hate the way I feel, I hate how money rules my life. I hate doing anything. Nothing brings me joy or even peace. I just want to end it all. I hate this! Why can't I do it? "
Point of no return?,Is it true that once a person knows they�۪re going to kill them selves there�۪s a small chance of them being convinced otherwise? I ask this because this is the second time one of my friends has passed this way. I can�۪t help but beat my self up over all the what if�۪s now.
worthless,"i want to over dose on 46 pills of 10mg of fluoxetine. i already cut , i dont feel satisfied. this blade is too thin. i wonder if im doing enough"
Burner phone for suicide hotline?,"I know this isn't the normal type of post here, but I was wondering if y'all could help me out. Here's the deal. Lately the impulse to kill myself has gotten a lot stronger, and I don't feel entirely safe, especially since I'm going to be living alone for a stretch in the near future. I'd like to know that I could call a hotline in case of an emergency, but I'm still on my parent's cell phone plan, and I don't want them to know if I call one. So I'm considering getting a burner phone for that purpose, but I don't know much about prepaid phones. Do I keep having to pay monthly in order to keep the number, or can I just add some minutes one time and forget about it? Do I have to activate it ahead of time, or can I wait to activate it when I need it? Thanks for any help"
How much would it hurt to jump out of the car door,my mom always abuses me while driving me and my brain shuts off like nothing matters and I just wanna jump out but I know I might not die right away and just end up sliced in half or something. one time she was driving me to work and I yelled back at her and she drove me right home and I couldn't go to work anymore.
I want to kill myself. It feels like a completely rational decision... no one cares about me. My only friend wants me for sex only.,"I'm ugly. It's my fault that I was born with this face. It's my fault that my parents never gave me an opportunity to do any sport or physical activity and now I'm overweight and ugly too.
It's not my fault that I had the worst time transitioning from childhood to adolescent and no one showed
Me how to take care of my appearance. It's my damn fault that my family treated me like crap and destroyed my self confidence forever. It's my fault that I have to live in a world that feels more like a hunted house to me than a real normal world. Everything triggers me and reminds me of my miserable upbringing and early twenties. I just want to end this. It really sucks also when you knew (with some doubts) all along that your only friend was only interested in sex but then now you know 100% that he is. I was in pain and I didn't have anyone to talk to. No one at all. I only sent him two messages about how frustrated I am with my life and he went off on me talking about how I shouldn't text him to complain. Good relationship and friendships are probably not for people like me "
I want to be normal,"I'm not normal.
I wish I could live a normal life, but I look at people and envy how they can express their emotions to people they barely know so well. Selective mutism has ruined my life.
I want to end it but I keep thinking about how I've never fallen in love, how I've never owned a house, how I've never driven a car, or went to a party on my own.
I'm a loner. An introvert. I so badly want to be an extrovert, but that's impossible with my circumstances.
I'm barely holding on.
Sorry I keep making posts, it's my way to let off steam.
Failing classes, I think my parents are disappointed in me, I just don't know what to do.
I want to kill myself, but they'd by sad. No one ever knows what's wrong with someone till they're gone.
I want to kill myself and see if people would actually care, or if they'd say, ""Yeah saw that girl once or twice, she never talked""
I have 0 friends. Pathetic of me, I know.
Any friend I've ever had I've pulled away from. Me and my cousin are very close but since I've become depressed again, I've pulled away.
I want to make an impact on someone.
I don't know how anyone could help me. I've tried, and failed.
I cry multiple times a day. Every day.
Every. Single. Day.I want to be normal.
So bad."
I just feel like unwanted and useless decoration.,"I just wish I was never born. When I think about it, there's no one for whom I make life better - just the reverse. My life hasn't done anything good for anyone. I guess all my friends and family members would be better off without someone constantly just causing problems and being one big problem.
I feel that there's just no place for me in this world - and I have really tried looking for it. Doesn't matter where, I'm always a misfit.The best I could say about myself is that I'm probably pretty but even that I ruined with all my self harm - so there's nothing left. I feel like unwanted and useless decoration. What's it worth to be pretty if you're just a disaster besides that.People just always leave me - and if they wouldn't my fear and knowing that they will in the end ensures it - or at least the important persons, the ones I actually really care about.
My life always just got better to only get even worse afterwards but I see an end soon. In the moment I don't even have the strength to properly and seriously consider suicide - because even that seems senseless - but I've recently just accepted that this will be my end. Maybe it will even last some more years but this is how it's gonna end. Every time something happens I'm a bit closer to ending it and there's not much left 'til I'll finally do it.
I don't see anything left I could do. I can't have any relationships anymore. I'd like to be a person that could just focus on her career but I'm too unconcentrated, too distracted, too tired, too depressed. So I'm just existing and waiting.Not even therapists have been any help, even they don't seem able to understand me and all the 'standard' things aren't working on me. My current doesn't even want to make the diagnosis because for her it seems like a lot of things - but then again not hundred percent one of them. So I don't even have some simple words on a paper describing my problem. She doesn't seem to care that I'd like to know. I should better call her the last one because this week I just didn't go for the first time - I saw no sense in this. And I guess even she is sick of dealing with me.
Everyone just expects me to 'hold on', 'try out new things', blaaa. For them it's very easy and they can't understand why I'm not full of hope because 'you're still so young'.I'm taking two antidepressants and have already tried two before it. Meditation. Sports (I hate sports). Everything is useless.
I just don't know what to do. It just hurts to be alive. I don't want to be here."
In the hospital,"First time hospitalized ever, including suicide attempts. Looks like theyre involuntarily hospitalizing me... fun.
Im super relieved though. When I was walking around, getting ready to find a place to do it, and it was totally cathartic, I felt good about my decision. Usually I'd get anxious, and coward out, but this was just so simple for me. But someone found me hours later apparently.
Iwas worried if I did wake up, my parents would be upset like when i was younger, looking for answers and crying. But really theyve just been chatting normally, staying with me before the doctors move me. I still don't feel any different, just empty, except for general anxiety. I had tried to mentally prepare myself for this, distraught parents, me crying, etc like my first attempt awhile ago. But its been casual so far. I actually prefer it.But I just want to ask: what exactly does involuntary hospitalization include? I was in outpatient beforehand, and all we did was group sessions, color, sometimes talk to a psychiatrist, but that was a childrens outpatient when I was 14, and now I'm 20."
I'm apathetic and nothing brings me joy or hope anymore,"Or well, nothing has for a very long time. Any possible future I could imagine feels like a drag, everything I currently do feels like a drag which is exhausting and I wonder if there is even anything that could make me happy. Meds and therapy haven't worked for me so I'm giving up on trying to find a solution to this feeling. I'm going to end my life because there's nothing that's going to make it feel worth living for me."
My life is a joke.,"I am constantly dealing with the feeling that no matter what I attempt to do, I will always be a failure, or just a mediocre person at best. I made the mistake of taking history for a BA, and after realizing what a useless degree it truly is I decided to go for an MA in hopes it would bump up my resume at least. I am now trying to start writing my final thesis and I have completely hit a dead end, I can't come up with anything and I'm already a month into the semester. Let's face it, history BA's just don't get people jobs. It's damn near impossible.Any full-time job I have attempted to work in has been a complete disaster, the only thing I have listed on my resume are working at McDonald's for a year, and other restaurants for 2 summers. I'm 23 years old and my resume is absolutely pathetic. If I can't handle a full-time job, let alone even get one, I'm fucked. I have already taken out loans for this degree and if I can't get it, I'm doubly fucked. All of that money and work will be for nothing. Don't even get me started on my love life, which right now basically consists of a guy that has used me to vent out his own sexual frustration under the ruse that he wants to give our relationship ""another shot"" (he dumped me a few months ago before summer vacation started). But then again I figure its better than being completely alone, since I can't stand to be by myself and think about how much of a loser I am.This degree is the one chance I have left to make something out of my life. I can't stand being worthless and useless anymore. I have no other talents or hobbies that would make me any more useful or interesting. If I can't get this degree and drop out, I will absolutely end my life. It has no purpose so far anyway, so why not?"
I'm fucked up fam,"I'm all messed up, you guys.So a couple months back, my best friend of 8 years committed suicide. It was his second attempt, and, obviously, his first success. Ever since, I've been really aimless and confused and disillusioned, but above all, stagnant.I'm no stranger to suicidal tendencies myself, but I've learned that after dealing with his loss, I could never bring that pain on someone else. He ran away first, so there was a solid week of just searching and hoping, and having all those hopes dashed, having to deal with the funeral and the end of an era, it's been really taxing.I guess I'm posting hoping someone can give me some direction. I'm not working at all, and I'm pretty much just spending my days smoking weed and playing video games, and tonight I realized for the first time why: I'm not really living for myself. I'm staying alive purely to appease everyone around me, but from what I can tell upon self-reflection, the only reason I'm not dead is because it would hurt other people if I died. Is this a fucked up way to live (I mean, obviously, yes)? Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Am I just feeling like this in the wake of my friend's suicide, or am I just realizing this because of it? How can I move forward when I only have interest in being alive for the sake of others? "
I can barely stand it anymore...,"Both of my parents barely ever pay attention no me, they mainly just talk and be with my older sister. My depression and anxiety got the best of me a couple weeks ago, and I ended up cutting my right arm kinda bad. My mom only said something about my arms yesterday because I was drawing on my arm, not the cuts. I honestly don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I...I just don't know what to do anymore..."
Would it hurt?,Sometimes when I have a bad day I ask myself if it would hurt if I just rode my bike into a wall at 150 mph.I dont really wanna die. At least I think I dont. But the thought of being able to get rid of all my problems that easily kind of comforts me.
Obsessed with suicide,I've attempted once before and got baker acted and the whole nine yards. Now I'm so broke I can't even afford a therapist and have been having sleepless nights reading different suicide methods/forums. I'm obsessed with it and it has not been leaving my mind for a bit now. I feel like driving my car into a wall 100mph with a blunt in my hand and maybe some psychedelics in my system or some other substances. Hell I might even do it today and not plan much for it because why the fuck not. The fuck should I do? I can't afford getting help and I just keep getting bills after bills I can't ever catch up and pay for things I like... I just feel like I can't be happy. I've always felt this way even when I wasn't struggling financially and when I was well off with a partner too. For some reason it seems no matter my circumstance I just want to be dead. Not awake. Black screen.
"I have schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, OCD, I'll go blind within two years and I just got diagnosed with severe ecoli and a herniated disc. I'm a college dropout and I lost all my friends due to drug addiction",Edit: I just found out I'm HIV positive tl;dr how in the fuck does anyone expect me to deal with this shit
Stuff That Happens All The Time In My Life,"Hey im 13 years old and Im doing this because My Family Hates me So much They actually hurt me (Phisicly and Verbly) They also threatened me and said That if I don't go to school (I don't go cause the fucking teachers are being Assholes one time they pined me up against the wall and said that I no one cares about me and If I kill myself no one would care and by then saying that I every time I go in the toilet and cry about it because it huts me, It hurts me so bad I've actually tried to commit suicide and I've cut myself) they would threaten to Hurt me (Phisicly) and I say Fu* Off or anything swearing wise and they threaten me again to hit me and I do it again and they hurt me so bad I start crying and no I'm not a crybabby and everyone I know they either say to me Your an Assholes, I hate you or my favroute go and kill your self  (I was being sarcastic) and all I need is some one to help me and ca're but no one does"
I took extra meds last night,"140 mg of fluexotine instead of my usual 80. 100 mg of desyrel instead of 50. Still depressed as hell. I started googling how much it would take to end it all, but kept coming up with liver damage posts. There's never a quick solution is there?"
good bye,"Ok so finally i had enough of this acting to be happy person. I must share some of my views about this planet and its most developed specie-humans!!Im 27y guy from europe, tall, buff, ugly! Some days i cant leave house if i catch right angle in my mirror and im fukin done. I go back to bed and just be suicidal for the rest of that day. Its best that i behave like that because if i went outside i would knock out some chad or girl that would laugh at my face.I love how we humans think that we are some prime creatures on this planet, but we are just evolved monkeys. Somewhere i read that we have same teeth like chimpanzes and that we have that bone above our ass where monkeys tail start. Some of us even look like monkey.There is obvious hierarchy in society based on looks, and i mean facial looks. That means jaw, chin, forehead, all these bones must be align properly for person to be seen as human being. If you dont have it, then you are fked. Strong jawed and strong chined guys are alphas, just like in monkeys where alpha monkey with huge head and strong jaw=stronger bite could kill weaker monkey and continue his genes while weak monkey wouldnt have offspring. Imo we are just monkeys in clothes and with learned rules.Ive tried self improvement, i really did. I also lowered my criteria to equaly unattractive women but it didnt work. Thing is, i think, that women have all the power in sexual market. They buy and guys sell. Vagina has huge price today and some below avg girl can choose between thousands of average guys. That means i dont have a chance.Thats what feminism did imo, give girls power to have sex with anyone they want without any repercusions and im all for that but that still leaves me and millions of guys alone.People enjoy my company and they invite me to do stuff but girls just dont see me as sexual being. When i try to start something i can see on girls face that she is insulted. Its like she has this ofxord degree and im asking her to work in mcdonalds. Imo thats because these girls have tons of guys that tell them how pretty they are(even though they are not) on tinder and irl.Thats all im done with this kind of life. I fought like crazy and my only option is obese weed smoker girl that does nothing in her life. I cant and i wont agree to that.In last 15 years i had more than 1000 "" no thank you"" and "" im not that kind of girl"" from below average girls. I think its time for me to leave this world that obviously doesnt want me.Good luck guys and girls!"
Don't want to die but my life is over,"Hi there. A few months back now, the start of June, I went on holiday for what was meant to be a fun great time with my friends. There was plenty of drinking maybe too much stupidly and one night my heart was racing, eyes couldn't focus and my brain felt foggy. Ever since that night it has been there 24/7. I have something wrong with me but doctors say all my tests are clear. My short term memory is awful and I can't remember anytjing. I just feel numb and in pain. I can't run without being out of breath after 10 seconds. What gets me is I loved life. I loved it dearly and had so many aspirations. But now it's all over because of one stupid mistake. I would of killed myself by now if i wasnt worried id fuck it up and because of my family. My life is a living hell and a utter nightmare. I just want to be able to function like a normal human. Things will never be the same again and it's tragic because I am a goos and nice person. I try to be the best person I can and I get this? Why me? What did I do to deserve this."
"No reasons to live, life isnt worth it","I have nothing to look forward to. I have no reasons whatsoever to get out of bed in the morning. I dont have a single reason to be alive but im so worthless i can't even kill myselfEvery day i pray some freak accident will kill me because im too much of a pussy to do it myself. I have friends that are supportive but the only advice they ever give me are ""things will get better"" ""it'll be worth it in the end"" ""you have more worth than you know"" that kind of vague stuff.That all means nothing to me. It won't get better because i am 100% useless and unable to make things better.I have to sit here watching all my friends be successful, going to early college, taking hard classes and getging good grades, getting in commited relationships and having sex, all of said friends younger than me when i havent come close to any of those.Im worthless and undesireable in so many ways, itd be better if i was dead so people donr have to deal with me anymore.I feel like maybe i want to find a reasin to live, something to keep me content until ""things get better"" but i cant. I find joy in literally nothing. Im so tired of waiting. I cant focus in class because im too busy fantasizing about death. I want to be dead more than ive ever wanted anything."
I am writing my suicide note while sitting next to my 4 year old beautiful daughter watching Sesame Street.My diseased brain is winning.,"Stop. Look at her and that should be a reason to stay. Stop, at least tell me how your day was."
I don't know what to do anymore,"All of my problems are so trivial and dumb, and I'm young compared to you all, (14), but I just wanted to get this out there.So basically, last year was hell for me and completely destroyed my self-esteem. I've ended up liking this girl (and i know how trivial and stupid this is) but it terrifies me because I don't want to hurt other people's feelings and I might make a mistake. It makes me not want to live, or isolate myself forever.I'm probably really stupid and selfish but im not sure how to continue. I'm trying to prevent myself from crying right now so im just gonna leave it at this."
Since I was 9 years old,I've always been having suicidal thoughts and for the past 9 years the only thing stopping me was that's impossible to get a gun in England and I want my last moments to be painless. My life's always hurt and just keeps getting worse and worse and I can't bear it anymore. I spend my free time while I'm not at college researching on suicide methods that I'll be able to do without arousing suspicion beforehand and I'm stuck.
i want to die so bad but cant,"im so done with life, i cant deal with existing as whatever i am anymore, i certainly am not worthy enough to be called humanim a 100% useless waste of space. nothing about me is redeemable, im just awful through and through.i desperately want to die. i hate life. i have 0 reason to get up every morning. im not alive for anyone. im not alive because i want to experience something, i have no reason to be alive. i should kill myself it just makes sense but i just canti feel like theres a small part inside me thats some sort of blind faith that maybe a miracle will happen and things will get better. i dont want to accept that my life is so pointless. but i have to. its unrealistic to believe every story has a happy ending and i guess i got the short end of the stick. theres just this little part of me thats in such heavy denial i cant kill myself, and i hate it so muchthe only things im afraid of missing out on when im dead are impossible for someone like me in real life anyways (not wanting to die a virgin, not wanting to have spent my entire life alone, wanting to experience even a sliver of hapiness or find joy in anything) so theres no point. whether i live or die it wont happen so why wont i just d i ei have friends but im too empty inside to care. it makes me feel worse that they care about me when im so hopeless. i dont want them to care, they'll just be hurt more. i really want to convince them to stop caring but they keep denying that i have literally no reasons to live. im an awful person, i dont know why they're so blind, associating with me will just make your life worse. i wish they could see that. they should be happy that such useless deadweight is off their shoulders and isnt whining anymore when im deadim so close. im right on the edge. i want to die but i cant make myself do it. i desperately want someone to convince me to kill myself, i just need a little push. every conscious moment is pain and i dont want to live with it anymore. life is torture but for some reason i cant end it. please it hurts so bad i want to die i just need one last little push im 100% consenting someone tell me why i should die, if i end up killing myself i would want to thank them for finally making me end my suffering"
"We insist upon forcing one another into the same hell we ourselves wish to escape, we must truly enjoy each other's sufferings, much like crabs in a bucket","Not really. At least, speaking for myself, I can tell you that I just don't want anyone to go through what I've been. Realizing you're beyond hope doesn't mean you give up on others"
im at the point where i cant feel anything anymore,"i will probably kill myself either today or in the next week , i just dont see any point in staying alive , if owning a Gun would be as easy as in america i wouldnt even write this and just kill myself right awayi bet it wouldnt even hurt , i feel so much pain every day a quick knife cut wouldnt even hurt"
Why should I keep going?,"I don't have any family or friends, and that isn't an exaggeration. I lied to the only person I have, my partner, about being sick so they wouldn't abandon me. I confessed half a year later. We still live together in a foreign country where I know no one because I would be homeless otherwise. I dropped out of uni twice. I am unemployable. I see no more hope. I have to live with them for a few more months and they remind me all the time of how I need to leave in a few months, making me feel even more abandoned. They tell their friends about how obsessive I am and delusional. I have no one else. Literally no one else. "
i need advice,"I'm worried about my brother. He's 19, my parents kicked him out when he was 18 for stealing their pot and shit so he's technically homeless but he just stays at different friends houses every night, It's no doubt that he's been really depressed but lately it seems to be getting worse and worse, he hasn't really talked to me in months and when i do text him he's really distant. The last time i texted him i asked him why he's so distant with me and he said ""idk i have nothing to talk about, not used to talking to people who listen"". He's always on drugs, he recently tried to quit but gave up after about a week  and my parents aren't even trying to help him out and now he seems more depressed than ever. His friends told me that he's being distant and hasn't replied to them over text in a while. I just don't know what to do. I love him and if anything bad happens to him i don't know what i'll do. "
"Angry, depressed, disinterested, not sure which","There's a lot of things going on in my mind right now. I feel even embarrassed that I have to make a Reddit account just to type this. I'll try to get as much as I can down now but I know I won't get everything.I'm on the brink of failing school. I'm a senior in college and I'm so close to graduating, but I just can't make it to the finish line. I already dropped one class; another professor suggested I drop her class; other professors are emailing me on why I'm not doing any work. The idea of being a failure makes me so disappointed and angry with myself. I don't want to let my parents down after all they've been through to support me through college, especially since my siblings had difficulty with college too. Every semester, I feel like my brain power and motivation has been cut in half; I'm at zero right now (I know mathematically that doesn't make sense but go with it.) I can't think straight about anything, I've been acting so recklessly, and trying to sleep has been a uphill battle for the past couple of weeks. I usually feel a bit stressed every semester and I might feel a little down, but this year has been pretty bad. Last spring semester was the first time I really considered just ending it all. Still, I managed to do fairly well. This semester is a complete disaster. I can't find any motivation in me to do anything, even things I like. I just don't give a fuck about absolutely anything. I'm just constantly bitter and I know that I'm not doing anything to improve it. All I do is beat myself up, go to bed angry, and repeat the process every day. I don't want to talk to anyone I know about it neither because it's too embarrassing.The thing is, I only considered self harm before and I always came to my senses. Now, not only do i consider my own life, but I want to hurt other people too. How am I supposed to admit that to any of my friends/family without scaring the shit out of them? I've never gotten in a fight my entire life and now I just want to go out in the most spectacular way possible. Edit: I think another reason I refuse to talk to anyone about it is that they wouldn't understand. Most people I know are Christian and the last thing I need to hear is anything about God. I was indoctrinated into Christianity when I was born so even thinking about religion just infuriates me. I don't hold that against them though.I don't know why I feel this way but I need to figure out how to snap out of it. I keep fetishizing my own death, suicide by cop in particular. My personality is usually level-headed, rational, and calm. I want to keep it that way. I don't like being angry, depressed, disinterested, but it's involuntary. I have no history of being depressed or anything like that so clearly school and my shit grades are the reason for this.Anyway, that long wall of text is only scratching the surface. I feel better now just for writing it down but the wave of anger is just going to come back again. I don't know how to deal with it. Venting seems to help but I don't have people to vent to without feeling like a burden or making them uncomfortable."
"I don't want to die, but I can't cope with life either","Im a 19 year old girl. I am terrified of death to the point where my life is now being wasted on severe anxiety and dread. I have developed severe physical symptoms and have been referred urgently for a scan of my brain to detect any neurological conditions. I am terrified that there's something wrong with me, but at the same time I think it's possible that I am having such a massive mental breakdown that it's manifesting in me physically. I was psychologically abused for years by my father and still am experiencing his abuse. I was also sexually assaulted at 14 and I never got help for any of it and I feel that I have finally completely cracked. For the past month I have been so constantly frightened that I haven't slept properly for even one night and have been having vivid nightmares and constant intrusive thoughts that I can't distract my mind from. I have also lost over a stone in weight in a few weeks. I have been having intrusive thoughts about illness and death, and what the meaning of life all is and whether everything is all just a figment of my imagination. I feel like I've really dissociated from reality even though I'm aware I'm doing it. I'm looking at people's faces and am just seeing flesh and eyeballs etc rather than a person, it's like I feel like everything is just completely surreal, like everything has become so absurd to me suddenly that I can't even see it for what it is. I also feel like my left side of my body is going numb and it feels detached to my body, which is why I'm having a scan. I feel completely unable to go on like this. I am terrified and feel like I might just suddenly die. I keep thinking about how I can stop this feeling immediately, but I am terrified of death so I know this isn't a way out, but I don't know what else is... I'm scared I'm going to either go insane or just jump out in front of something impulsively... I've been to A&E and told them this, but no one will help me... I'm a young girl so I still look okay even though I feel like I'm in the worst mind state possible... I am truly scared for myself and have no one to turn to or care for me and am being dismissed by mental health professionals... I am very lost and afraid"
Feeling like it's too late,"I'm 22, dropped out of high school in 2011 and haven't done anything since. Never got a job anywhere, never had any intentions of going to school. I chose to do nothing and rot away in isolation instead. I spent my birthday alone just earlier this month as well. I've read about disconnected youth. I feel that it fits me to a T. I feel I've fucked my future already by doing absolutely nothing and being a hermit instead. I'll talk to people and they'll say, ""well, you're young. You'll figure it out."" I don't really have any kind of passion or ambition, though. I thought about seeing a therapist, but I just feel like I'll tell them what I've said here and they'll say the same thing else everyone else has been saying. It's fruitless. I intend on hanging myself this Halloween. I'd hate to devastate my family, but everyone in my life should see it coming anyway."
"21 years old: never been kissed, never had a girlfriend, never had sex",every day i want to kill myself. tonight i'm feeling especially shitty. i just can't take it anymore. it would be so much easier to just die
I have three days,"I have three days
I have the gun
I have the bullet
I have three days"
Too good at appearing to cope. Not coping.,My therapist told me I�۪m a master at hiding my feelings. I think people who have struggled with  depression for most of their life know exactly how to put on an act.
just done it,"Swallowed a few too many propranolol.Life is fucked. I've been getting told 'things get better' for almost half of my life now. They've never got better, just much worse.Like ive genuinely lived half of my life wishing i wasn't here, how fucking funny is that ahahahopefully i had enough propranolol to get the desired effectcheers to the people on here trying their best"
I need help for my friend.,"My friend is showing many signs of suicide and depression. He casually brings up ""jokes"" about dying, I usually try to laugh it off so it doesn't darken the mood. I've had a serious talk with him only once, and it seems he's depressed because he isn't popular and doesn't talk much with other people besides me and some other people. I know for sure he's suicidal because I've seen him post something like ""I don't want to live anymore.""What should I do? Edit: Some information you might need to know to understand
-We're both boys in highschool
-We've been best friends for like 6 years now
He's not exaclty the best at anything, but he's good a multiple things
-He plays lots of video games and doesn't like sports
-I probably the only one to know that he's suicidal
-At best, I hope to not have a serious talk with him because I'm not good like that (But if it's the only way, I'll do it)"
"No one asked if I wanted to be born, like WTF","So I hate how my waking hours are spent working and working and working , doing what they want me to do , and then I get hardly anything, and the cities in the USA are violent crime impoverished shit holes, tell me how this is the best place to be?. You see I got HIV and have other health conditions and I find no enjoyment in life. I calmly explained to my parents that it is immoral for me to have child, much less them, when this world sucks so much. I find it horrible. "
I don't have the energy to make my life better,I was so happy. I had such a hard year in my 2nd year of college dealing with anxiety and depression. I was really looking forward to this year because I felt like I was finally pulling it together and my hard work was paying off. I moved in with my boyfriend of 4 and a half years and then he broke up with me 2 days later. I love him so much and his reasoning is that he's not good enough for me. I think that should have been my call because I was really fucking happy. So I had to move out of the apartment and leave the city I loved to live with my parents in my tiny hometown. I dropped out of school and now I'm supposed to get a job at the fucking mall or something. I hate this. I want my old life back. I tried so hard to get my shit together and it was taken away in one day. I don't see the point in investing my love and energy in anything because I'm in so much pain.
if i found a gun i wouldn't be alive tomorrow.,i often hope maybe I'll just stumble across a gun on the sidewalk someday. i dream of it. that's how i want to end it. i hate my fucking face and i don't want anyone to ever see it again. i just want to blow it to bits. a shotgun would be nice. i just hate coming home everyday and falling apart breaking into tears because of how shitty my life has always been. it isn't worth it. it could all be over so quickly if i had a gun. maybe i shouldn't be so picky.
I just want to end it all.,"Maybe tonight, I have roomies moving in tomorrow, but I really don't want it. Thing is it brings our rent down by a lot utilities included, so it's really hard to say no.... Especially when they cannot afford rent in the area. Fucking housing crisis! If we said no, they would literally be on the street tomorrow. No figurative/hyperbolic speak here, just on the street and nowhere to go.I don't know where I'm going with this. I just wish it would all end already. If I have to go through 10 more years of this shit... It just isn't worth it. Life just isn't worth it. Nothing I do makes living worth living through."
I just feel useless,"I feel like my life has been for nothing, I worked hard for 4 years to get through university and get a masters and its all for nothing. I have no job, no prospects, I live at home and have �25 to my name. I'm a fucking failure."
I'm Tired. Pleas Give Me One Reason.,"I'm so fucking sad. I'm too young to be this sad. I'm too young to constantly dream about my death, or see my dead body wherever I go. I can't go to therapy. I can't go on medication, both per my parents rules. If I try to talk to them, they tell me it's my fault, I'm not helping myself. They tell me to ""knock it off"" or ""get over yourself."" I'm being forced into getting a job (I have to apply for one job a day or else I get grounded), I'm taking a nursing assisting/introductory medical careers class that's not easy and will help me get prepared for any potential careers, but that's ""just a class.""  Nothing important, apparently. The only reasons I haven't killed myself yet is 1) I have homecoming next weekend. 2) my boyfriend has lost too many people already and 3) my parents would be those assholes who'd go on the local news and say ""we didn't see the signs. She was such an intelligent and beautiful young girl. Here's the local suicide hotline number and pls make us feel like good people."" I don't want to give them the satisfaction. I try to talk to my boyfriend too, and he's usually really good at talking me down. Oftentimes, though, after a while of repeating himself and dealing with my shit, he'll just stop answering. It's because in his mind he doesn't think he needs to say anything, but nonetheless it hurts. Especially when I'm so vulnerable and needy and lonely. Please give me a reason not to break into a safe in my parents' closet and take the bottle of Vicodin in there, or not to take a razor blade and draw on my arm with it. "
Trapped. I've made a huge mistake and I hate my daughter's father.,"Waiting for the suicide hotline chat to put me in contact with someone.This hurts. Really bad. I�۪m really angry and despairing at the idea that I want to leave my partner. I only want to leave him if he won�۪t see how selfish he is. He doesn�۪t see how playing video games for 9 hours every day after work really gets to me and makes me feel unimportant.Today he came home and immediately started bitching at me for not telling him the status on the car. I take night shift for the baby every night. I take care of her all day. The only way I can get any real breaks is by essentially setting her down with him and running away. A lot of times when I ask for help it�۪s met with a sigh, or ���I�۪ll do it in a minute�۝I feel unimportant. I understand he works full time, and walking 45 minutes to work on days when the car isn�۪t operational really sucks, but I feel like I don�۪t matter.I want to leave him. I have wanted to for a long time. He isn�۪t empathetic. He doesn�۪t understand. He won�۪t listen, he always tries to argue with me. when I bring up concerns, instead of, well, LISTENING. He feels threatened when I bring up things he�۪s done to hurt me and always justifies it, explaining to me that I�۪m ridiculous for believing what I do.He won�۪t seek help for his problems. He�۪s admitted that he has anxiety and depression, but he doesn�۪t dwell on it. My chest hurts. I feel heartbroken. I feel like I�۪ve made a mistake with him. I haven�۪t slept and felt rested in weeks. Every time I sleep, I wake up from a horrible nightmare. I want to cry. I want a cigarette. I want to hurt myself. I want someone to pay attention to me. I hate that I don�۪t allow that. I want attention, but I don�۪t. Why the fuck am I like that? Why can�۪t I just ask for help and not feel like an idiot?I can�۪t sleep tonight. I was sleeping, and then the baby started grunting in her sleep like she was winding up for a hungry cry only two hours after I put her down. When I tried to feed her, she wouldn�۪t take it. So now I�۪m upset that I�۪m awake, I wasted formula (which is expensive, and we don�۪t have a lot of money right now.) and I can�۪t bring myself to go to sleep because I just KNOW that as soon as I start to actually sleep, she�۪s going to wake up again. Even so, when I tried to go back to sleep, this horrible existential hatred kept bubbling up in my chest, making me want to go out and destroy something.I wanted to go cuddle. But he has to get up at 4am to be at work until 5, and its almost 3am. I know if I went and climbed into bed and woke him up with my problems, he�۪d be a grumpy dick and it would defeat the purpose. So here I am, alone, tired, and trapped. I can�۪t just go for a walk and leave the baby here, and I don�۪t want to get her all set up to go out just so I can get some peace, because that�۪s not peaceful. I have a therapy appointment next thursday. I want him to go to therapy too, but he absolutely refuses to. He hates therapists and doctors. He doesn�۪t trust them. He doesn�۪t want to face the fact that he needs help, because he grew up being told that he was a problem that needed to be fixed.Well, the truth hurts buddy. I am also a problem that needs to be fixed, but at least I WANT to be fixed. I can�۪t exist in this eternal denial. It hurts too much. I can�۪t keep living with this compulsion to put a blade to my wrists and let the blood out. I can�۪t live with the intense need to scream and rage and lash out at the very idea of life itself. I can�۪t do any of that, because I have an infant I need to take care of. Those desires are squashed, and I feel suffocated by it.I love her. She is not the problem. Its him. I feel taken for granted. He�۪s chosen not to work for the vast majority of our relationship. I worked while I was pregnant until I couldn�۪t anymore. He tried to walk out on me while I was in labor because HE was tired, and I calmly convinced him to stay even when I wanted to scream at him ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! YOU�۪RE TIRED?! I hadn�۪t slept properly in WEEKS, I�۪d been having contractions for DAYS, and YOU�۪RE TIRED?! You would rather go to sleep and miss out on the birth of your own daughter, likely the only kid we�۪re ever going to have? Worst of all, he lied to the nurse IN FRONT OF ME. He said he had to be at work the next day which was BULLSHIT. His work KNEW I was in labor, and gave him the time off to be with me, and he didn�۪t want to be with me.I won�۪t talk to him about that because he�۪ll take that criticism and bury himself in the sands of denial. And that right there is why I�۪m so heartbroken. You can�۪t take that back now.I can�۪t talk to him about how I feel. I can�۪t tell him I want to kill myself. The answer I�۪ll get is ���HOW DARE YOU?�۝ and then the story of his friend who�۪s girlfriend committed suicide while he was at work.That�۪s not listening. That�۪s shaming and judging. And that compounds the pain and just makes everything worse.I hate this. I thought I was bound for something better, but my dad was right. This rebound born out of spite was a bad idea. I let my codependency lead me into something that only looks better on the outside because at least this guy will talk to my family, as long as they don�۪t do anything to offend him.I want out. I want to run away. I want to take my daughter and go, cut all ties and go far away. He doesn�۪t care. He�۪ll fight me for his daughter, but he won�۪t fight for me. He�۪ll find every reason to blame me for the problems that exist, or to excuse himself from doing more work than he has to. Every time I go to the store, he asks me to get him a sugary snack he can dip in milk. Nearly all the milk goes towards softening cookies, crackers and doughnuts. I can�۪t eat that, even though I do. First off, it hurts my teeth. Second, the amount of sugar fucks me up. He is addicted to many things, video games being the primary issue, but also nicotine, pot, and fucking sugar. He promised he�۪d quit smoking when our daughter was born. He still smokes cigarettes at work. It pisses me off. I can�۪t believe anything he says when he promises to do stuff because he�۪s forgetful.And if I say something about it, suddenly I�۪m bitching and nagging him. Suddenly its my fault for wanting him to follow through with what he says and what I ask. I�۪m tired of cleaning up after him all the time. I spent an entire week doing nothing but picking up his mess, and after finding out that the car had to go back in the shop, I lost it. I haven�۪t touched the kitchen in days. It�۪s filthy. He hasn�۪t touched it either, since he works in a kitchen all day. I can�۪t cook. I know I need to eat healthier, but I don�۪t have the energy or resolve to do it. I can�۪t bother to dirty some pots and pans and plates to feed myself. My days are spent taking care of the baby and things relating to her. I set up insurance for us, I schedule doctors appointments, I coordinate this and that. I spend so much time on the phone and running errands and he doesn�۪t even think to ask me about my day.I�۪m just so sick. I am literally sick. I want out. I want to hurt myself. I want to bleed. I want to be taken fucking seriously. I want to cry. I hate this. I hate what I�۪ve gotten myself into and I hate saying it."
My life ends here and now.,"I've never amounted to anything in the 30 years I have been on this planet. I've no friends, no family, and no one who cares about me left. I lost my job and will certainly lose my home soon as well. There's nothing left for me, but to take that lonely plunge off a bridge. Maybe death's icy embrace will finally make me feel comforted.Good bye world. "
I dreamed of a sunset at the end of a tunnel...,"I'm am artist in my own right. I draw. I write fiction and songs. I sing. I'm a good person. I never insult my friends and family in any serious tone. I go out of my way to please people, even when they are so cruel towards me, out of pure love and adoration, maybe even as a form of worship. I'm a good person... Or maybe I'm delusional. Perhaps I'm the most selfish and mean-spirited person this world has to offer.Nonetheless, I tried. I tried everything in my power to get better without angering anyone. All my efforts eventually boiled down to this, pleading to strangers for help and friendship in my worst state of mind. Not too long ago, I had a dream in which I was running through a tunnel that seemed like a sewer. My desperate footsteps splashed up a suspicious looking liquid along with various plastic and mammal litter. It smelled of decomposition. The stench stung my nose and eyes, encouraging runnels of salty tears to trail down my cheeks. The pitter patter and scattering of rats echoed off the rounded walls along with unidentifiable screams. I was afraid but I saw the sun and ran ever quicker, the golden spray of light gently painting the curves of my face dimly. I soon noticed that the sun was sinking into the horizon as if it were trapped in quicksand with a trillion pound weigh tied around each of its rays. I ran with more haste, wincing as glass and sharp plastic penetrated the soles of my feet. As I reached what I perceived to be the end of the tunnel it became pitch black and looked as if a wall was slammed down in front of the opening. My own screams woke me up. I can't help but see the symbolism. I don't know how much longer I can deal with the constant ups and downs of this so called life. The tunnel gets longer everyday. I can't pretend I'm okay. I need someone who will just listen and care without any ulterior motives. I don't want to stress out my friends or family. I'm at the end of my rope. I need someone while I still care because once I'm done caring... C'est fini."
Only 2 months left,"Just created this throwaway, but been feeling this way for too long. I apologize now for my writing, I just need to get this out there.I�۪ve always had chronic health issues since birth, severe allergies, asthma, GI, etc. I�۪m a frequent flyer of doctors offices and hospitals. I�۪ve led a pretty non-social life of essentially no friends, I always put school and then work first to help provide for me, my mom (who I live with) and my dog.I�۪m also graphic/web designer. My first job was a dream that lasted 3 years until an extreme medical emergency took me out of work. They got rid of me a month later.In the span of 2 years since, I�۪ve only managed to secure contract work, and now I�۪ve had three jobs essentially automate me out, replacing me with free graphic tools online and I have just enough money to make it to the end of November (if I�۪m lucky, December). I�۪ve applied for upwards of 30+ jobs in my field with no success, and I will also lose my health insurance due to being to old to stay on moms insurance plan. My moms job is also at risk due to an ongoing company buyout. It takes both our incomes to make it and me being jobless is sinking us. We can only afford rent and bills for 2 months.I just don�۪t know if I can make myself witness it all fall apart. I�۪ve sacrificed a life of friends, I�۪ve never been in any relationships or dates. I�۪ve never traveled. I�۪ve done everything to keep us afloat and now it feels pointless. I don�۪t want to lose what little we have left. I don�۪t want to be homeless, or not be able to buy medicine. Everyday for the last six months I�۪ve wanted to sleep and not wake up. When I lost my last job in July I nearly pulled the trigger. I just have no one else to talk to and I don�۪t know how much longer I can stand it.Tl;dr No job, no hope, no future and only 2 months left til we�۪re broke."
25 and my body is broken I can't imagine what I'll be like in 10 let alone 40 years,"Im 25 y/o male and the past 6 months I've had pain in my hands and fingers develop so badly I barely finished my pharmacy degree, developed foot pain that I can no longer run and get sharp pain just WALKING. Now my knees, hips, elbows, neck and back ache. Everything is such a mission.This disease has taken away everything I love. I can't do mma anymore, can't do any sports, physiotherapy and swimming hurts me for God's sake. I JUST WANT TO TYPE WITHOUT PAIN is that so much to ask? I had to quit my dream job after 7.5 years of study, I never even got the chance to work full time. I would have been a millionaire in 2 years due to opportunities given to me when I was able bodied. I gave up my social life, sports and relationships to get that job and now I give it up for pain.Now all my savings are gone, my social life is shit. I can't even play playstation as a distraction because my hands are screwed. My parents think I should 'just be more active'. My gf loves me but I don't wanna burden her anymore, she should just leave me. I want her to because at the moment I feel like she's the only thing keeping me from taking my life. I want to get a hotel fill the bathtub with Ice and end it, at least my organs will be helpful to someone. I tried doing uber even and my fucking hamstrings developed tendonitis.I used to want to be an mma fighter, a rich entrepreneur and be surrounded by beautiful women then as I deteriorated, I just wanted to get married and work full time and raised a family. Now it seems that is not even in the cards.I was blessed with everything to make it, except for good joints and I'm so bitter about that. Tl;dr disease has taken everything, just want to die now."
To nervous/anxious to talk to people.,I want to talk to someone about my problems and such but I am too nervous to do so. Also it isnt just being scared to talk but when ever I think about it I feel weird and awkward about it. Its hard to explain what the feeling is. Thoughts on how to go about  this?
I have extreme anxiety and my job makes me do what causes it. Every morning I have so much fear that I consider suicide and I just don't think i can keep going anymore. What should I do?,"I work at [fast food joint]. They claim they train everyone everywhere so everyone can be in different spots if need be. They hardly trained me at making food, which I am actually good at and can contribute to the company efficiently. Day 2, they put me on register in front with no training whatsoever. I have no idea what I'm doing for the most part up there, and the constant new people and being the face of the business is not me. I'm not that kind of person. I freak out when I talk to best friends, let alone stranger after stranger. Also I get yelled at constantly by both customers and managers because I still have pretty much no training. once in a blue moon I get to make food and I'm really good at it. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but it's just the facts. The managers always put someone trained for register on assembly or grill and the food line is always out of food, but not when I'm back there. It makes no sense where they place people and I've  talked to them a bunch of times... Some people never leave grill, things would run so much better for their business and for me mentally if they could put me there. They pretended to listen and said they understood my anxiety issues, then after a week right back to register for pretty much ever. I honestly have such fear every morning before work I consider suicide realistically. My life is already a terrible mess without their complete and utter disregard for employees strengths and weaknesses. It's not only counterproductive to their business but it is killing me almost literally. I'm a fish who is paid to climb a tree while they drown a monkey. I'm dying.Please give me advice. I have an 8 hour shift soon and I just don't think I can do it anymore. Its been 7 months of this and it just keeps getting worse somehow, I just want to die."
Dreaming of suicide,"My suicidal thoughts have been very bad lately, but I had a dream about hanging myself last night. I always dream in the third person, so I saw myself hanging in a completely white area with a chair to the ground. It looked extremely odd. It felt sad and cold and pathetic. Oddly enough, I looked like a man in my dream as well. I point this out since I'm a trans boy, but I am fifteen and completely in the closet and usually dream as a girl, so it was weird. It's been the only time I didn't feel happy dreaming as a man. Most of my suicidal thoughts come from the fact I'm a closeted trans boy and can't transition now. Wowzers. Until now, I didn't realize the connection of my dream dreaming myself as a man and having me commit suicide. It was to show that I want to die immensely because I can't be that man yet. Holy shit. My mind is being deep again.I just thought I would post something different here because why not and I don't know a better place to post this other then here."
"I'm depressed, but I can't make myself believe that I'm depressed enough to do anything.","Jumping right into this, I'm a 16 year old from California. I know I have depression, and insane stress, and I definitely have suicidal thoughts more than daily. But I feel like because of the fact that every time I try to tell my family something personal about myself they shoot it down like they know everything about me, I can't talk to anyone about anything and I always feel like I'm wrong about my problems even when I deep down know I'm right. I want to call 911 on myself, but I feel like I'd be wasting their time and/or my family's money at a hospital or something, just for my family and especially my brother to yell at me that I wanted attention. I don't know what to do."
"This pales to some of the posts on this subreddit, but I felt like I needed someone to talk to.","Hello everyone.Today at school, I was putting up my cello in orchestra class, and someone was blocking my locker. I asked him to move, but he didn't respond, so I poked him. However, after I poked him, he (much bigger guy than me) came over and attempted to poke me back. In an attempt to protect myself, I curled up, and when doing so, punched a large hole in the side of my cello (in the ribs). I looked up the cost of repairing such a hole, and I nearly fainted from it - it is around $800! When I came home from school, I told my parents, and both of them absolutely blew it. They told me ""it's only been the first 5 weeks of school and you already have caused so many problems! You first forget to turn in a homework, then you get bullied on the bus, and I had to write an email to the principal, and now you punch a hole in your cello? Why can't you ever consider the consequences of anything? Why didn't you just take the poke? Why did you try to curl up? What is wrong with you?"" My dad later told me that ""our family tries to save so much money, and now, you blow all the money that we saved by a huge accident? What the hell is wrong with you?"" I have told them a few times in the past that I have felt sometimes that if I was gone, the world would be much happier, but then they tell me that I shouldn't use the word ""depression"" and suicide is the most selfish thing one can perform and then they yell at me for like an hour. Please help!"
Hit me like a wave!,"I am just gonna do it I am so tired of this shit, I can't catch up with my pos life!"
I should probably just do it sooner than later,"Everything makes me feel inadequate, the smallest things completely ruin my mood, I have no self-worth at this point. I hate myself and I�۪m never going to not hate myself. I�۪m not going to make it through the rest of med school without attempting at least once so I should probably just go ahead and try. For several months now I�۪ve thought about what a tragedy it would be for my friends and family if I killed myself, but I�۪m starting to get past that. It wouldn�۪t be so sad if I just didn�۪t have to deal with everything anymore. I�۪m starting to realize what a relief it would be."
There is absolutely nothing that makes me happy.,Video games and TV are boring. People make me nervous. I don't enjoy any music. I can't commit to exercise. Eating makes me feel like shit. School stresses me out. Drawing makes me think I'm worthless. Nature is aggravating. Success stresses me out even more (some how). I just feel like a walking shell. Started cutting again just for stimulation. I'm probably going to continue editing this list with everything that doesn't make me happy.
One every 22 seconds,"This October will be a year that I was medically discharged from the military for crippling PTSD.
I have been hospitalized over 10 times for suicidal ideations since November of last year, including two 30+ day residential treatment facilities.
I am now enrolled in an intense therapy program though the VA and nothing is changing.
I have a plethora of medication that I have saved up for months.
I can't live like this anymore. Update: 22 a day.
Not thinking clearly."
What happens when I call the Suicide Hotline?,"I want to anonymously talk to someone. im not fully suicidal, but i do have occasional thoughts of suicide but ive never made a physical attempt and i dont plan on doing so. If i tell them that, are they gonna notify local police/my family? i dont want my parents to know bcuz theyre already stressed about financial issues and even though i know they would do anything for me, i dont want to add more stress to them. so again, would the suicide hotline notify my parents or local police if i mention that i have thoughts of suicide but not planning on actually comitting it?"
Cycles of Anxiety. I just don't want to be me anymore.,"I don't know where to begin. Nothing is how I wanted it in my life, I'm in a 5 year relationship with a guy who has no interest in sex. I put up with it for so long but I recently broke down and cheated on him. I absolutely hate myself, mostly for not being able to break up with him because neither of us can afford to move out of our lease.
Then a few days later....the worst happened, and I can't help but blame myself. I was drinking at a friend's house, and was apparently sexually assaulted..I went to bed in my friend's room and woke up in her (guy) roommates room sore all over with a hickey. He says I came into his room and started it.... I find him repulsive and can't imagine I would do that but I was so drunk I can't prove anything..  I feel so different about the first consensual encounter and the second non consensual one. The second one makes my skin crawl, it makes me want to cry every time I think about it. He's so gross. First he tried to say nothing happened but I got mad because I knew he was lying and he finally told me. He said quote ""it was like having sex with a dead body""
This is the second time something like this has happened in 2 years, and I'm worried something about me screams ""take advantage of me"" I want to shed this skin that's been defiled and just start fresh. I want her roommate to feel what I feel and know how this has affected me. I want to die. I want to die and let everyone know it, because at this point they are all surprised I'm alive anyway. (My mom tells me ""she's so glad I didn't kill myself back then, I would have missed my sisters weddding"") I have so many messed up sexual feelings. I don't want anybody to touch me, but I feel so sexually frustrated. I don't want to bang randoms and my boyfriend doesn't want to bang me and I'm goddamn cute. What the fuck. I'm sorry this is so incoherent, I guess it's just my stream of thought. Thanks for the rant."
my closest friends are all suicidal,"if one of them goes, they all go. honestly it makes me want to do it, but i know that they'd all do it too. it's a chain reaction. it won't end. i'm scared for them. i'm scared for me. "
I just need a friend,"I'm going downhill, life has it's moments and all, but it's not worth it too me anymore. My dad is suicidal, my mom is an alcoholic, my sister is throwing away her future for a boy, and I have the nerve to think I'm better than everybody for reasons I don't know why. I don't have any real friends, my days are CONSTANTLY the same, I'm always tired, and I'm on the path to a life I don't want. I'm going to drop dead one day, so why not do it while I'm young? I got the plan and the stuff, now I'm just waiting for the right moment. "
Are sleeping pills good enough?,"Exactly what the question asks... Would they kill me if I take a lot? I'm getting desperate and I don't know if I want to run around until I find a roof high enough to jump off from (i don't think I have the balls for it tbh). Thinking of sleeping pills... Would it involve pain? What will I feel? God, I only think about my parents and the cost of me dying (actual money) but legitimately I can't anymore... And if i tell them, like I did 2 years ago, I'll be treated like I'm just a slacker and lazy, that i need to get a grip. I want to get a grip, at least for the last thing I do."
I feel like hurting myself.,"I have no real reason,  yeah I have major depression and anxiety but I just feel it's my best option right now. I feel like I work to live, nothing excites me anymore and I feel like when I'm not sad I'm just distracted never really happy... I just turned 24 and I work a meh job and still live at home like a loser. I also recently finished my GED and my folks are proud of that but I feel it was still just a waste of time. I don't know how to be happy. I don't want anything and I have what I need but I just feel this is where I'll always be in life and I'll never go anywhere...."
Its just an accepting feeling at this point.,"so I have been dealing with depression for over a year now. and these past 3 months or 4 (I don't really count anymore), Have been the most suicidal I have ever felt and its been the worst this week. everyday is just the same and the pain just starts feeling numb. I would of killed myself already if it wasnt the fact I have to deal with the chest acking thought of accepting my death. but as of late its just become more of a im ok with not ever existing and being forgotten feeling. I just don't care about anything in my life anymore. Im 16 and its already gotten to the point where im actually ok with my death and im ok with being forgotten. and I walk through the hallways wondering if it ever is just going to stop and I can finally rest and stop dealing with all this mind aching shit. talking to friends now has just turned into something I do so I dont feel as alone as I used to feel. honestly im just tired im just done with everything nothing feels good and im not looking forward to doing anything anymore."
Growing and getting better.,"I recently attempted to kill myself. Ever since then, my life has been improving so well. I've met someone who makes me happy, I can be happy on my own, I haven't felt suicidal at all ever since my attempt, and I haven't even felt that depressed--I'm super happy now. I hope all of you guys can experience this soon. I don't think I'll need this subreddit for at least awhile. Thanks to everyone who's helped me throughout these hard months."
it's all so pointless,today im just. done. i cant keep pretending things will get better. they wont. i keep trying and trying and trying to hold on but im tired. im angry all the time. i have ptsd. im supposed to be out of danger but my brain hasn't gotten the fucking memo yet. i dont fit in with anyone. im completely useless and unlikable. havent left my room in days. i avoid people because i dont want to drag anyone down with my negative shit. nothing matters. nobody matters. people are monsters and i dont want anything to do with them. i should just blow my head off and be done with it since ill always be fucking stuck like this.
pal,im falling apart and my insides are collapsing i msis yiu so much please come baxk
Observations,"I'm typing this to either figure out a reason to live, or to confirm that my life might as well end. At this
 point, I don't care what happens.Here are the facts. I used to care about my future, and I had lofty goals of being a scientist and
making the world a better place. I thought I could advance human knowledge and get us closer to reaching
 the stars. Big dreams.Of course, I was deluded. Maybe if I had time, money, resources, and energy, things would have been
 different. Maybe I could have been the next Einstein.But time passed. Everything I did slowly depleted my energy, as I realized such goals were nearly
impossible. My ambitions faded. Failure after failure after failure. A lot of confusion and no accomplishments.
A lot of basic knowledge in practically every field of science, but nothing advanced enough for me to figure
out something new.Besides, there are thousands of actual scientists doing everything I wanted and more. Yet there have
been no revolutions. Just tiny increments made by far more intelligent and driven people than I.So, I got into game development. I can write. I can design game mechanics. I can
solve problems. How hard could it be?Again, the life was sapped out of me, due to a combination of overambition and a
lack of energy. Endless half-complete projects. Some good ideas, but too ambitious to
achieve without 10+ years of constant effort. I learned so much, but got nowhere. Again.Again, my ambition slowly faded. Nothing finished. Once again my apathy crept in,
and once again I stopped caring.Another problem with that whole game development thing: As vital as it is in
anything technical, I hate programming. Endless hours of configuring libraries, messing
 with compilers, dealing with hardware quirks, figuring out cryptic documentation (or not
 having any documentation at all), puzzling over bizarre code... the list of problems is
endless. It seems that 99% of programming is spent being useless and confused. Maybe
 that's just me. I don't care anymore either way.So once again, I was useless. Many times I thought about getting into a development team of some sort. But then I'd have to deal with someone else's abandoned projects, and have my work stolen.That brings me to another matter: Humans are trash. With a species as generally advanced as we are, you can expect some horrible individuals. But humans display so much stupidity, greed, and cruelty that it boggles the mind. ""But there are so many GOOD people out there!"" I hear some say. Of course there are. And for each good person, there are a hundred morons or sadistic monsters out there.Stupidity is the real issue in all of this, though. You'd think in the information age, we would see a massive golden age of education. That's true to a degree, but it's only proven that there are millions of idiots out there who don't want to learn or use their brains. Which means the problem is mass stupidity, not a lack of education.So far, I have a lot of failed dreams and a problem with stupidity. It's not the end of the world, though. But I'm not done. Not even close.Next is the problem of where to go from here, and why. I have no future, no energy, no ambition, and no goals. I've been in an endless loop of learning, trying, and fizzling out for something like six years now. I'm sick of it. And what's next? More overworking, in a pointless rat race job where skills don't matter and playing corporate politics gets you everywhere. A meaningless and stupid life.And to even do all that? I would have to use energy that I don't have. Repeat for 50+ years, and then I die anyway. What a pointless life.""But you have so much to live for!"" Do I really? Half of my life will be spent in debt slavery if I even have the will to get that far. America: Land of Greed, Home of the Debt Slaves. And if I ever need a doctor, I'm done for. Because of greedy idiots and everything in medicine being obscenely overpriced. I've thought about just leaving; going to a country that's not run by shortsighted greedy morons. But I have neither the money nor the energy to do such a thing.So where am I now? No life to live for. No motivation to try anymore. A bleak future of probable debt and homelessness. A lot of incomplete knowledge that I don't care to use anymore. Mediocrity and failure. And when all is said and done, I really don't care. I don't even regret what could have been. I've just accepted that I've lost the will to do anything, and life is going to be unpleasant from now on.And if it isn't? Then I got lucky. The world doesn't care about you or me, and it certainly doesn't care if someone's life goes better than predicted. It's just chance. I'd rather not gamble an entire life of misery for brief moments of passing enjoyment.I don't care about what blind optimism you might spew at me, because it's delusional tripe. I don't care if one good thing might happen in a lifetime of misery and failure. I don't care to even TRY, because odds are I'd fail anyway, even if I had the energy to do anything. I just don't care anymore.I've rambled long enough. This hasn't been nearly as thorough or structured as it could have been, but -- you guessed it -- I don't care. This was a personal exercise anyway, and I've only verified everything I've been thinking about for years. I don't see myself being alive another two years. Maybe not even six months.Against my better judgement, I'm posting this to Reddit. I don't really care where this post goes (mods can delete it for all I care), but I think I've put it in roughly the right subreddit. Every discussion I've seen of this sort has been worthless to me, and this one probably won't be any different. We'll see.Oh, and to dispel the useless generic responses: I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I exercise regularly, I don't care about friends, I don't care about family, I don't care about relationships, and I don't care to have kids. I don't care about being rich or famous, my (dead) ambitions would put me in debt for decades (thanks, 'Murica), and I would probably never achieve anything meaningful anyway."
Suicidal post hurricane,"I feel helplessly depressed, been feeling this way for a very long time, years now I think, with intermittent moments of happiness. Trying to be strong and a little bit more selfless because 2 hurricanes hit my island and everything here is going to pieces but i can't  seem to be a bigger person. Want to off myself. Feel hopeless. Feel estranged from loved ones and friends. I wish I had the guts to kill myself.  "
Living a total lie,"On the outside I have everything - good job, nice house, two healthy kids and a kind and handsome hubby.Three years ago I got involved with my narcissistic ex and it has sent me into a downward spiral. He is sexy and a super-achiever and he chased me down in hopes of getting back into my life. After a few months I gave in. I was flattered by the attention - he made me feel sexy and desired and I lapped it up. Unfortunately I am a complete empath and romanticized the whole thing. All he really wanted was sex. He has a long term gf but he doesn't really love her either.We have had many explosive fights over the years and I have felt powerless to escape. I have gone through 5 therapists, had 2 past life regressions and seen a psychic healer/medium. I have tried no contact, throwing myself into work and working out and my kids but I am spiralling. Nothing is working.He refuses to let go, but he won't fight for me. He basically wants a fuck buddy. He says he cares for me but calls our relationship a love/hate. He won't get emotionally close to me, and says he puts up walls and is defensive out of fear.Recently I discovered that he had hooked up with a former classmate and read all of their sexts. I was devastated. I also suspect other women but he denies everything and says its me or no one. He say he often wishes things were different between us but logically he knows they can't go anywhere. He treats me like trash and we basically just hook up at his office and see each other maybe 2-3x a month. We have gone through about 6-7 weeks of no contact twice and then one of us caves in.I have become so hateful and bitter while I watch him live his fabulous life without me. He is traveling everywhere and living a glamorous life and I feel worse and worse. Things have gone downhill lately as he recently told me to ""fuck off"" during a fight and I have basically seen him on whatsapp all night. He calmed me down over the wkd and thinks we should have a cooling off period as things have been super heated. He blocked me on whatsapp. To make things worse I recently revealed to him that I love him. It had to come out by now bc it's true. But I feel like he minimized our situation and made me feel stupid. I feel like he doesn't value me and that he doesn't see me as being ""good enough"" for him. A few months ago I got a mommy makeover (boob job, tummy tuck etc) and the truth is that a lot of the reason I went through with the surgery was for his acceptance. I did get more attention from him maybe...but emotionally we are still so far apart and I am so sad :(I feel close to exposing him and ruining his life and mine. I am sitting in the car at work bawling. I feel so disgusted with myself. My moods are CRAZY all of the time depending on what's going on between us. My family can't see why I'm suffering obviously. I feel selfish, shameful and slutty. I feel trapped and wish I had never done this. i am so close to rock bottom that I'm scaring myself. I am on a business trip (alone) for the next two weeks so I find myself obsessing and feeling hateful and angry and sad. I sometimes wish I wasn't here anymore :(I am so sorry I made this huge mistake. I will never forgive myself."
The end of the road.,"I'm 18 and I just can't exist anymore. I am failing school and I know that deep down there is nothing I can do about it. There is  future for me. I have already been spoken to twice this week about how much of a failure I am by staff at school. I just feel overwhelmed. There is too much work to do and I am never going to get the grades I need. I can't break my bad habits, I just can't. I have been looking at people killing themselves online. I have been thinking about drinking bleach or jumping out of a window all day. I really want to cute my arms, too. Really deep cuts.I have no future. As far as I know, I'm already dead. I guess I need someone to talk to, though?"
What happens when you get caught overdosing or after trying to?,"Im curious to know if one could actually get jail time for trying to overdose. Ive only seen in movies people getting sent to a scary psych ward of pyschotic people. Is jail time really a thing? Someone wanting to throw me in jail or send me away like im just weird and have a ""problem"" would actually make me want to kill myself even more once I get out.What I'm asking is, what is the worst thing that could happen if youre found trying to kill yourself by cops or higher authority? P.S. I'm asking from the U.S. "
I want to end it all but I don't have the energy,"I thought about it a few times and even considered what I would put on a note or my will. But I've never tried. I don't know if it's because I'm too scared or if I don't want to bother anyone more than I already have. It's gotten to the point where my flaws get in the way of everyone else. My social awkwardness scares people away and if they do try to talk to me, I accidentally puck them away to avoid saying anything stupid. I've been hiding my Autism behind a shy, emotionless persona to avoid looking like a weirdo. I would end up looking like a weirdo either way. My thoughts are telling me that ""it's better to be shy and normal rather than myself and weird"". I want to break free but don't know where to start and I don't want to lose the few friends I have because of this secret. I have a visual impairment which has left me looking unattractive and unapproachable. I can't see or experience the world like a normal person but I WANT to. I just can't. My younger sister and everyone in her Year treats me like shit (and I don't blame them). I've been nicknamed, shamed on social media and have them talk about me. Plus from my sister (who I have no way of moving away from) I deal with her mental and physical abuse everyday. I take the blamed for things that ""my brother did"" in order to protect him. My parents think it's just sibling rivalry but I think there's more to it.There are only two people in my irl life that I would consider telling about my thoughts but one of them I don't want them worrying about me (they get panicked easily). The other person although I get along with them well and he's trying to help me build my confidence, they are a crush that will be nothing more than that. He's so ""up there"" in school compared to me. He's smart, funny and confident. I'm none of those things and I would just be an annoying person holding him back from having fun.I spent the last two years trying to improve my social skills and my confidence. Despite trying everything I'm now throwing the towel and giving up. I don't care what happens to me at this point. I had goals, dream and ideas. Now I don't see any of it happening."
It's not my husband's fault. He just needs someone different.,"Every time someone in the public eye dies by suicide, I think ""well shit, that seems like a good idea.""I've been suicidal off and on since July 2015. Being suicidal for 2 years actually means I'm a lot closer than I was then. I've got a better plan, done more research, and I'm now in a place where it's actually easier to do than it would have been in '15.  Long story short, my husband needs someone different than me. He doesn't think he does, he just does.and, i never should have been born in the first place. I'm also religious, so there's that. But, I don't think that the rules about suicide are true. I just don't. (Although reddit loves to jump on religious people and loves it when religious people have a hard time. It's so predictable....)I think this is not hte right place to post. I read everyone elses stories and I feel genuinely bad for them. I'm glad things aren't as bad for me as they used to be. In fact, that makes suicide seem even easier, to be honest. I'm so close. So close. I never should have been born. I've survived a shit ton of trauma and as it turns out, I haven't survived it. I never should have been born. No man is an island. I'm going into the sea. "
"rage, sadness and powerlessness","feeeling like shit 24/7. this life on earth is ruled over by a rotten system that i wasnt ready for. this isnt what life should be about. unjustified suffering, abuse, indoctrination is everywhere.
i suffocate under infinite regrets. i failed at adapting.
my intentions were only to spread positivity. it turned into an addiction fed by my ignorance, narcissicm, frustration and loneliness.
they say im bipolar type 1. my experience is that the mental health  system condones depresssion and emotional outbursts. people's poor mental health is only a symptom. the elephant is this primal ''survival of the fittest'' system we're subject to. fuck elitism. how about empathy and love? no, all that matters is competition and feeding crooked egos. this world is unforgfiving and ever unwelcoming when you're a loser like me.
my adrenaline is caged. i just wanna get the fuck away from me."
Nothing left worth living for.,"For as long as i remember, i have always lived a nightmare.  My family has always been a mess, with a spoiled ungrateful brother, separated parents who always had expectations i couldnt meet, and then there is me, the ugly, awkward Asperger.  The few fruends i have/had either killed thenselves already, tried to, or tried to rape me...Ive been bullied in for my entire childhood, never could fit in class.  Now im basically in uni, with barely anytime for myself to cheer myself up.  Classmates all have made friends with each other and hang out often, i havent been invited once to any of those things.And then there is the academic part. Anxiety and stress made it so right now im basically in an unrecoverable position, and will probably get kicked next semester.And finally...""love"". What a funny little thing that is, makes you clouded to the real world living in an artificial happy bubble...until reality kicks in again...I have been in a relationship 3 times.  3 times have i been dumped like a sack of rotten potatoes without the slightest regard.  Dumped on Xmas Eve?  Yep thats me.  And now my latest relationship dumbed me for questioning how many other people she was seeing (She saw 3 people in the span of one month).   She said its because she was polyamorous so it was normal, abd i was the asshole for having my feelings hurt.  She then proceeded to leave me only to replace me in the span of 24 hours by another guy, as if i never existed.I cant hold on anymore.  Ive already tried anti depressants, that doesnt work, they arent miracle pills after all...
Probably going to hang myself in the next week or so.  At least i wont feel like shit all the time."
Dead kittens,"I remember now. That time my mother told me about how she drowned some kittens because she wouldnt have been able to care for them.
My brother is going nuts. Lying about everything to everyone. Drinking, debts to no end. Breaking up with everyone in the family (except me yet, although he has been lying to me too). Today my mom told me she would be so glad if she wouldnt need to see him ever again. In the past she said she wouldnt care if he tried to kill himself (again). I wondered if she thinks the same about me."
help?,"I had a nervous break down last week and I almost killed myself. The feeling of urgency passed but now it feels like I'm always thinking about doing it, one way or another. I don't know what to do with these thoughts."
I don't know how to help my friend,My really good friend broke down crying today while talking to me about not knowing what to do. She's been depressed for three years (we're in eighth) and she's tried so many medications and therapists and nothings changed for her. I just want the best for her but she doesn't want to go to a hospital because they're going to lock her up and she's despaired because the medication won't work and she hasn't found a good therapist and I don't know what to do. She's cutting again and thinking about suicide and I really don't want to lose her.
I've been trying not to give up. for 18 years.,"Just lost.  I recently left an abusive partner after he screamed and yelled at me for hours on all the ways i could and should kill myself.  It was the first time I seriously considered it.  He'd only been violent a couple times (and is a raging alcoholic, but I rationalized it as ""he wasn't as bad as my ex husband"" but it took him almost getting that way before I realized it).   I reached out to some of my closest friends who don't live in our tiny town, and told them everything that was going on.  a close friend (of 13 years) offered for me to come stay with her.  trying to tie up loose ends here (I live two states away from her) now that its the weekend I have to move she has fallen off the face of the planet and isn't responding (her literal last message was talking about how excited she was for me to get there, but she's seen my few messages this week trying to work out the details, but not responded.... even though shes posted on FB)....  I asked my dad to come stay there for a week or two while I find an alternative (I work from home so as long as i have wifi thats not an issue anywhere)  but they dont have room.  I asked to store my gardening stuff in his barn. they dont have room.  i asked my mom to come by my house and pick up my photo albums and such so I dont have to put them in storage with everything else.  she doesnt have time. and doesnt have room.  I messaged at least 3 other friends involved in animal rescues for help with fostering my two dogs (one of whom is a service animal for my anxiety and PTSD.... but that makes no difference to other ""friends"" who said at the last minute that I can come stay there now that i have to figure out something else)  no one has even responded.  even congratulating friends on engagements,weddings, and new babies the last couple of days no one has responded.  three of my ""best friends"" got married last weekend. as in three different weddings.  none were even mentioned to me.. I just saw it on facebook.  I'm not even a shit show. truly.  I've opened my doors to all of these folks in their times of need.  dropped everything to pick them up when they left their partners, wrecked their cars, were evicted. etc.  any time I even allude to the fact that I'm struggling emotionally I get the ""you're so strong, you'll pull through this"" I mean I've been getting that my whole life.  I moved out on my own at 15, the first time i ever considered that suicide was a better option than my family situation. I was fine though and landed a full ride to college and moved there on my own.  I married someone in the military, and had our first son during his deployment to iraq.  he was increasingly violent after he returned home and ended up leaving for a 19 year old the day after i gave birth to our second son (that was in 2007).  He has a long criminal record with domestic violence between me and her (his now wife) but somehow (after endless court battles and seemingly frivolous motion after motion) he managed to get custody of our children and I havent seen or talked to them since 2011.  (to clarify, other than a brief few months in college i havent touched or even seen drugs.... that was long before i was married or a mother) I never drank even until after he took the boys.... at that point it was more of a ""what do i have to lose""  when I had the boys i was never abusive, neglectful, or any other stereotype that typically comes with non custodial moms.  which after becoming one I've learned so much about how abusive partners fight and win custody battles.  i just learned it all too late.  he had too much money and that veteran card, and then more i bent over backwards to keep the peace with him for the boys' sakes, the more it was used against me later.   just saying, I've always sworn no matter what that I cannot and will not leave this world by my own hand. that theyll be old enough someday to come to me on their own (and they were with me 100% the first 4-5 years)  but other than waiting the other 6-8 years until then, i literally just dont have anything to live for. and I'm so tired of treading water and halfway drowning in life in the meantime.  I feel like thats all I've been doing my whole life.  and the more I reach out for help the more I'm reminded that I really just dont have anybody.  like literally no where to turn. like i said I cant even get my mom to pick up my photo albums.  or my dad to make room outside for my flowerpots and garden hose.  I dont drive but if I had a car i'd at least head off to the coast somewhere and mentally reset. im just stuck in the middle of nowhere. surrounded by so called family and friends. and remembering why i left as a teenager in the first place."
Set a date,"My only true companion of 9 years, my dog, passed away suddenly due to a ruptured intestine. On the same day, I lost my best friend because she doesn't reciprocate my feelings for her. Funny thing is, I pleaded to talk to her for a bit because I just needed someone to talk to. She had been very busy with work and off-the-grid for a couple of weeks. Mistaking my plea to talk to her about her answer, she simply curtly rejected me and went off-the-grid again. It's not her fault, she wouldn't have known. I have a propensity for irritating, long, personal talks anyway. I think for most people here, the slow burn is what compels them to eventually end it. It's a slow, tired grind and it's the same for me. And similarly, I'm tired of it too. Very, very tired. Truth is, I'm just lonely. But I have been feeling that way for 11 years now. My family is pretty much entirely dysfunctional since young, so that's not an option. I do have friends, but i just don't connect with them as much as I did with my best friend, but now that's not an option either. And this always happens: people go away when they get to know who I really am. My dog, Phoebe, is the only one who keeps me company on long, lonely days. But now she's gone. Only thing holding me back now are the releases of Justice League and Star Wars. After that, maybe I'll go on ahead. "
My husband wants a divorce,This is after he cheated on me and we had been trying to fix it. He seemed genuine and I believed he wanted to make us work. A few days ago he said he'd cut me off financially and I wouldn't be able to go to college anymore if I didn't decide I loved him soon. Yesterday he told me he wanted a divorce and now he's back tracking that comment. I tried to find the razors last night and just end it but he found me and instead of trying to stop me he just insulted me. We have a son and he's what keeps me going but now I think he'd be better off with a better Mom who isn't depressed all the time. I don't know what to do.
Help Me To Help Another,"I checked up on my ex's twitter after about ten years apart. Not the first time I've done this, but the most worrisome. She didn't mention suicide but I've never seen her like this. She has a lifelong history of severe PTSD from childhood abuse. She was maybe 26 when we broke up and I never noticed anything too concerning except some panic attacks and a psychotic screaming episode involving flaying a large knife through the air in my vague direction. She had taken Wellbutrin for depression but she never seemed paranoid aside from a few episodes and I only recently started noticing some of her tweets getting very obsessive about extreme conspiracy, tweeting for hours on end and live streaming, frequently switching dialects and accents and referring to herself in the third person, conducting journalistically styled interviews with herself.  It's probably just boredom or something, but we are middle aged now and it's a bit concerning since I've never heard her so gloomy and negative, never at all dissociative, but now so very much so. I may have missed the possibility that she has some kind of severe personality disorder. I never noticed any dissociative behavior before and she just appears very lonely and desperate about the state of the world. Anyhow, I don't know if there's anything I can do to help her. I'm reluctant to contact her directly and I'm worried sending anyone of our mutual friends might trigger her or somehow screw things up. We have one good friend I know never hurt her, but she probably doesn't even remember him. Is it a bad idea to request someone a welfare check? I'm worried to even alert her that she'll guess who did it. One of her more recent relationships ended in a mysterious death, which was probably just a suicide, but still is worrisome. I just feel so bad and I feel like I could help, but it would strain my marriage, so I don't know if there's anything I can do at all."
I have decided to end things.,"I'm 28, and my life has been terrible ever since I was a child. I have now gotten to a point where I have lost all my friends, my job, my family, and I really feel there is not much left for me.I have 30 zoloft, 40 temazepam, dramamine, bottle of rum, coke to make the taste a bit more pleasant. Don't know if this is enough, but running a bath just in case this doesn't work.I was too scared of actually going to through with it before, too scared when I had everything prepared but couldn't swallow the pills. Now I just feel that it has to be done, this has dragged on long enough.Got a free will off the council, paid all my bills and credit cards. Left everything I have to my brother. In a way, I don't know why I am posting this here, but I guess I just wanted someone to know how I am feeling right now. I was called an attention whore by someone who used to be my best friend, maybe he is right. Well, bye world, if there is a next life, please let me keep some of my memories so that I don't make the same mistakes next time."
Suicide is relief.,"I won't ever be well adjusted or normal. I won't ever have my shit together like a normal person. I don't want to live for 50 years constantly failing, being seen as and actively being lesser.Sleeping forever and never waking up sounds perfect."
Should I forgive my friend?,"I ended a friendship a couple of years ago and while I don't regret it I do miss the good times we had. He was occasionally a rude loudmouth and sometimes a major dick... but he was also smart, skilled, funny, polite and friendly. He sent me a massive apology on Facebook and I'm wondering if I should give him another chance "
Suicidal for over a decade,"No reason to wake up everyday
All college is doing is adding debt onto my record, and destroying my household
Dysfunctional as fuck family
an alcoholic absent father
a nariccist ignorant mother
suicidal thoughts violently flood my veins and pump my heart full of scars
Smoke more, feel less pain
O nly reason I havent gone back to hospital is because if I survive, then I'd be stuck under suicide watch again which isn't fun"
So tired of feeling like shes going to realize that shes out of my league.,When she does I'm done. As an aside. The number of posts on this part of Reddit is depressing. I was scrolling for a long time tonight and never hit a post older then 24 hours. So many people that want to die. I always think that if they had a way to erase myself out of people's minds then I would have done it long ago.
I don't know what to do,"I feel so miserable. I just want it all to end. The only thing that's keeping me from killing myself is my parents. I don't want to hurt them. But I have no one to talk to, nowhere to go. I can't find the words to describe how bad I feel really now. It's unbereable and I don't know how to stop it. My mom is going to come back home from work soon and I don't know if I should tell her. I've always been afraid of talking to her about it but now I'm so sad I think I may do it. But I don't want her to tell my dad or anyone else. I just want to die, every day I think more and more about it. It hurts me to think of the reaction people woud have but I can't keep living anymore. "
They put up a fence at the bridge i was gonna jump from,"I have planned to jump off the George Washington bridge in NYC for years. The idea always bought me comfort and relief. The bridge is a popular suicide spot, high, and with beautiful views. The railing was low and easily manageable. Now they have put up a fence just so the tourists won't see other people's reality.This is so fked up man. People will kill themselves anyway if they're determined enough, but why force them to go somewhere else? The bridge is a beautiful spot. The government don't allow asisted suicide, and don't allow people to jump from nice locations. No compassion at all. Now i feel lost. That was the only thing getting me through each day. I always thought the GW bridge was a dignified way of dying, a simple leap. Now there is a tall ugly fence."
Not motivated to live,"There is nothing particularly wrong that's currently happening. In fact the only struggle I am currently facing is horrible grades. The reason for those horrible grades is that I just don't feel like putting effort. Not only at school, but everywhere. I just don't feel like living.This isn't the first time I've thought about giving up, however I've honestly always been afraid. Unable to bring myself to do it. I dunno what I'm hoping to achieve by posting this. Hoping for some opinions I guess."
Any event triggers suicidal thoughts,"Any bad situation in my life, no matter how insignificant it is, makes me want to kill myself - awkward social interaction, being criticized by others etc. Not sure why this happens, oftentimes I think something is seriously wrong with me and I lack the survival instinct others have, since I want to give up on life so easily. IMO, life is worthless and the bad moments greatly outweigh the good ones, in quantity and quality, so I don't care if I stop living. "
I'm writing my notes and wondering if I should tell mum?,"I'm in the process of writing my final notes to loved ones and it's occurring to me that maybe I should tell someone. I really want to die, but I don't want to hurt my family. How do I go about this?"
abandoning life and running away.bye.,"f14.  im done with everything. running away from home in about 2 weeks and probably killing myself because i cant cope anymore. school is fucking ruining my life and i have no friends, everyone hates me. all i do is cry in the toilets. i even hate myself, alot. my parents arnt physically abusive, its just the stress and pressure and rules they put on me. 'be home as soon as school ends, only 30 minutes of computer(which is nearly always supervised), no pocket money, good grades or else youll be locked out of your room forever, no makeup,' ect... and not to mention all the chores and homeowrk i always have to do. ive tried talking to them for nearly 2 years but they dont listen. they dont care. nobody does.i have actually no friends, i dont have a phone (My parents took it away from me and are never giving it back) and i cant go out anywhere and i feel like an emotional hostage. i want normal parents, a normal life, and a fucking friend.but yeah. bye i guess."
Hpefully i won't wak up tomorow,I jut took bout 10 hydros drunk a bpttle of jack and hopefully inwont wake u9Mom.... I'm sory I coldn't be the peron you thoght I ould
I cant get suicide out of my head.,"It's been all I think of. I can't make decisions. I can't continue on. I feel like my life is coming to an end. All I've been able to think about is how I would do it, and what I would say. I love my family, and friends and people close to me so much, but my inner turmoil is never ending. It's been 12 years of this. I've never had a time of absolute calm. I've tried everything. This seems the only way out. "
Uk I'm very unhappy because im ugly and I get treated like shit for it...,"I'm a dude, 5,11"" lanky slim ugly. Up until 2 years ago I was happy and content and I never thought i was ugly, I worked In pub also and liked it sometimes. After 3+ years of working in there I couldn't face it anymore so I didn't go back as I was scared of being called ugly by groups of girls or staff I worked with etc . realising I'm ugly had hit me hard and I was fired/sacked straight away form my job in November 2015, ever since iv been a hermit and  even going the store takes huge courage and when I do it's my hood up and over my forehead as much as I can. I try getting on with it but it always there at the back of my mind, I can't run away form being ugly. The worst is when a random girl looks me down when I glance back at her etc like ewww look on her face Then in march this year I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, I didn't feel a single thing of it, more numb to everything really. I wanted to refuse treatment as it was my ticket out of this life but my mother talked me out of it, I got angry and asked her why did she give me life (which I regret saying coz it would of hurt her). Now I'm just an ugly sad case sitting around waiting to die...each morning I wake ok had me thinking 'oh fucking hell not this again', anyways idk what else to say...thanks for reading Pics are on my account if you want to see"
I feel like I should have the right to die.,Why isn't euthanasia legalized. I don't want to fight this bullshit anymore.
Hi.,My name is Jason. I'm 17. I don't plan on turning 18.I don't want to say anything else.Carry on.
I'm ending it soon,"Mom in jail, dog died, staying with my abusive grandma, aunt died, untreated mental illnesses, best friend moved to Oregon, second best friend almost killed herself the other day. I can't take this pain anymore. I'm not actively planning to kill myself soon but I feel like there will be a day where I know it's time. Bye everyone."
"if you're a suicide prevention volunteer, i have a question: is it common for volunteers to seek out high-risk individuals and talk to them in public or in school, without them knowing they're a volunteer? or is there anything similar like this?","Edit: i'm asking this because, recently, a woman has been talking to me during lunch. i usually sit alone against a wall, but this is out of preference so i can get some semi-alone time during the day. Anyways, she doesn't go to my school (high school) and wears a ""visitor"" sticker. i believe she's finished school. she first approached me out of nowhere, asked to sit with me, and then began asking questions about my life (siblings, hobbies, pets, etc.) she's always smiling and happy and thinks everything i do is interesting in one way or another. at first i thought she was just a friendly visitor with some free time, but as the days of her visiting grew, i became suspicious. after three or four times we've talked, she asked for my number she doesn't show up every day and she has other people she talks with as well. have i been placed on some sort of watchlist, and she's a volunteer who talks to me to distract me from bad thoughts/suicide, or is she just a friendly person i met through odd circumstances? I'm also a female, so i doubt she's trying to flirt with me and if she is, then it's not going to get her anywhere considering i'm not a lesbian "
Life is 10x worse after attempting suicide,"Sorry for the very long post. I tried to keep it short.A few months ago a lot happened in my life, I was kicked out of my house and as a result attempted suicide in a hysterical state in my friend's house by overdosing on what I could find there. I asked for an ambulance when I started to collapse (it's terrifying and painful, not peacefully slipping away like in the movies) and was driven home to get help there.I wish every single day I took more pills and suceeded.I know what I did is a selfish thing and very upsetting and I get the anger. I deserved it and I was sorry. She asked for space and I gave her some, stopping contact with our group of friends to leave her be. Over the next month they all started acting hostile, they were doing immature stuff like liking and disliking pictures on social media so I'd see. I was accused of stealing things I didn't steal by someone. I eventually spoke to her because I was feeling harassed and she said so many hurtful things like we were never really friends, she didn't want to see me. I was too depressing etc.We were best friends throughout high school and did everything together so it was a huge shock. Especially because she herself tried to commit suicide in someone else's house and I always tried to help her with her problems. I found out after talking to other people she'd been telling everyone I'd been saying really nasty things to her that just weren't true at all but no one would believe me or listen to me so I cut off contact in order to help myself.It's been months and everything is worse, the depression is a whole other level I've never experienced. I miss my friends. I miss my best friend. I hate myself. I know in my heart the end is soon."
I need help...,Ever since I was born my mom would always physically abuse me but as I got older it was more emotional and I can't do anything about it but its really hurting me and just making me want to go onto things like drugs or even her alcohol. I think about how much it would be better if I died but I have some people in my life who actually care and I wouldn't imagine losing them. A lot of people also take advantage of me because of my looks but then always go behind my back and I can't take it anymore...
I Have No Where Else To Go,"I don't even know where to start. I thought when I was diagnosed 2 years ago that I would have an answer. I thought that I would be able to just take 1 pill and be done with having mental illness. Now my meds change month to month or even week to week and I've added medical cannabis. Although I have all these tools, I'm still rapid cycling like ALL the time and I lean towards manic more of the time. I've tried so much. Hospitalization, stronger meds, weaker meds, cannabis, deep breathing, guided asmr, fucking fidget spinners. And I also have chronic physical problems like asthma. So now because of all the medication I�۪m the heaviest i�۪ve even been and its not really helping my depression side. My manic side is going bonkers tho cause it wants to do it ALL and NOW and that overwhelms me to the point where I panic or take a nap because its exhausting. My family also forced me to get a part time job which at 21 you think I�۪d be ready for but all my other jobs were in a medical lab and not retail. Now add all these feelings up and you get me: a 21 year old female with bipolar 1, PTSD, anxiety disorder, borderline tendencies (or so my doctor says), schizoactive tendencies (so I say), trichotillomania, asthma, GI problems, and more who is also a full time health care student, an actor currently in rehearsals, and an employee. Wow typing It out makes it seem like way more that I thought it was. Geez. But today I was watching old Masterchef episodes and I remembered that one contestant was diagnosed similar to me and had killed himself. Then I thought about how many people with conditions like mine end their lives and it reminded me that a few of my close personal friends were apart of that. And it got me thinking that one day I would become apart of that statistic but I don't want to be but I see no other end solution or resolution to my life. I'm trapped where I am in life and I see it as the end. I don't know how to end my life but I know it must be done. I feel like this is my conclusion. Helium? Pills? Jump? I don't know but I just am done."
Sigh,"My life has just been a series of disappointments. I never asked to be brought into this world, and I want out. Whenever I think I've hit rock bottom, somehow it gets worse. I'm sick of waiting for the next thing to go wrong. I've struggled with depression for so many years and I finally went back to the doctor's and prozac is just fucking me up so bad. I throw up every day regardless of if eat or not. I have no energy and no motivation. The person I truly thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with broke up with me just over a week ago now. He's been so cold and distant and I don't even have the energy to cry anymore. All I want to do is sleep but I have crippling insomnia.I'm supposed to turn 20 I'm November but I don't think I'll make it until then. I don't want to sit and wait for the next shitty thing to happen to me and break me down even more. I want control over my life back and I honestly feel like the only way I can get that is to just end it all.Everyone says they care but no one shows it."
First time I physically almost killed myself on purpose.,"Alternate title - TIFU by not ending it allI don't remember and am too lazy to check as to how much I did or did not write on my last post here about my life, and ending it all. I was scrolling through to see that I am not alone on this sub when I found someone had posted that they flipped a coin heads or tails heads they killed themselves, and they did it five times just because they were feeling so down. It landed tails each time, and they had felt like some ""supernatural being"" had been behind all of that. I am a Junior in High School, and my US Government/History (We learn a few things about when the government and the USA as a whole was established, and for the rest of the year we talk about current events/politics) course has been a major contributing factor to my wanting to end it all, and my seeing no purpose in life. He often goes off track and on the first day suggested that everything that he says is in the past technically because there is a speed that light and sound have to travel at to reach us. He said that because of this, we could each be in different universes. Obviously, I did not believe any word of what he was saying and took him for one of the many crazies over at  (not saying all of reddit's conspirators on that sub are crazies, just saying that because the one time that I went on there there was a user posting about fluoride being a concerning and dangerous chemical that the government puts in our waters). But anyway, he was talking to us one day about this book called the Law (some conservative conspiracy filled book that our grade has to read, I guess) and he was telling us that the government is an illusion and that religion is an illusion, and both of those are just here for us to do what we're told and to behave, and that if we really wanted to leave school right now, nothing is stopping us, so why shouldn't we? It really had me thinking, am I just here because my parents are guilt-tripping me into staying alive? I already had no religious belief, so that part didn't phase me. I figured some time ago that religion was a system to keep humans hoping and to keep them alive, because ""god's watching over you so you better do what you're told"", yadda yadda ya. I just figure that when we die we feel the same feeling as before we were born, and that feeling is a feeling of pure nothingness. But it really had me wondering. My dad is catholic, so he kept telling me that if I kill myself it's a one-way ticket to hell. My mom told me that I'd better not EVER kill myself, and though she does not condone me smoking marijuana, she'd rather I do that than go and kill myself. She got really sad when she heard from the guidance counselor about my plans to kill myself a few years ago (my friends ratted me out), and she dumped out my 2 methods of suicide that I had in mind. I had to come up with a new way to die, a new painless death, and I still am, to this day. 5 or 10 minutes ago, I walked into the kitchen. I took out a chef knife (the biggest one that we have in the kitchen), and held it up to my thumb to see how much damage it would do. I then held it up to my throat, and thought about sliding it. That's how close I came to death today, and looking back, I wish I just had the strength to end it all. I feel like going in to my school tomorrow and telling my guidance counselor about it, but my mom is going through so much hassle right now that she really does not need to deal with my depression and suicidal thoughts on top of what's on her plate. Another driving force that's really weighing me down are my grades. I have 2 F's but the rest are B's. The teachers and staff would not believe me if I told them that everyone hates the 2 teachers whose classes I am failing, because in the previous years I've been slacking on my education and overall I've been being careless about my future. I really don't want to fail my Junior year of High School and have to use my work money to attend summer school, but that may be what I'll have to do, sadly. I really hate those two teachers, and their classes are another one of my many driving forces to die. I've heard rumors about what happens to the people that get caught coming close to death and suicide, and it does not sound fun. I hear that the people that get caught get sent to facilities and hospitals for doctors to monitor their mental state, etc...I figure that that racks up a bunch of money on the bill for their parents to pay, and my mom is single with 4 kids (albeit 2 of which are grown up, but still). Another driving factor is the fact that my brother is doing so much better than I am. You guys probably assume that this is selfish of me, but my brother is doing so much better in school than I am, he has a girlfriend, and my parents are proud of him. It makes me feel unimportant, which, I figure, would make most of you assume that I would want to be doing more in school and getting a girlfriend to make my parents proud. And I do, it's just I physically do not have the energy. My friends call me a fatass, and I can't say that I would argue with that. Even though I have a healthy bmi, it's close to saying overweight, and that bothers me. I've tried to resort to bulimia, but I can't even make myself throw up. I've looked up ways to make myself puke, but none of them worked. I could buy ipicac, but I'm shit at hiding stuff from my family. I would buy laxatives, and tell my family that I'm trying to use them to stop gas throughout the day, but I'm afraid of taking those (don't ask me why, I wouldn't be able to tell you.) "
How to prevent your friend from suicidal thought?,"So guys this is my story, I have a friend and she is close to me for almost 2 years. But i notice something that sometimes i feel like she used a mask for her everyday life. It is 3 mask And i the only person that notice it. The she said she have many problem, and many people thinks that she is super happy person with no problem at all. But all she did is faking her smile. Last night we call but  when i am trying to be there and say that she is not alone, she just push me back saying that she can drag me to her suicidal thought, and even if i stayed with her, the situation wit her suicidal thought won't change. She said :""Don't have any hope, don't know how to hope, don't know what to hope for..""She learn psychology, she said that ppl with suicidal thought can survive with hope, but she has none.I don't want everything turn like Chester Bennington. But i don't know what to do right now. I want to give her hope, but I don't know how"
Ready to go - how to stop family from having funeral,"It's time to give up.  My family have been such assholes, and I can't stand the thought of them using my death to garner a bunch of sympathies.  They've pushed me to this, know I'm there, and won't do anything to help.  I don't want them posting gofundme and making money off what they've done to me.  Edit:  There has to be a way.  whether it's going out so gruesomely that they can't identify my body or maybe a lawyer or something.  I guess he'd do something to stop you, too.Edit 2:  In case anyone is interested, I got my dad to agree he wouldn't let my mom have a funeral or exploit me with a fundraiser.  So at least there's one thing he's willing to do."
Anyone want to PM me,"I don�۪t have anyone in my life who cares enough to talk to me. We can talk about anything you�۪d like, (books, music, tv) anything to get my mind of things. Thanks"
Worthless,"I'm worthless. I have no value to anyone. I am not making anyone better I am not doing anything for anyone... I am just worthless. I pushed away my ""friends"" I never even had real friends. I'm just worthless to everyone. And I know ppl will say you are not and there are people who care about you, which I know is true but I'm still worthless. My existence just is just a burden to earth. I just ruin everything. There is no helping this. I should be gone, should have been long gone. I don't know what to say or what to do. I am and will forever be worthless."
1 week left,"I lost the best job of my life about a year ago. Took a job with a shady guy then got let go from that in Feb. Lived off of unemployment insurance for the summer but that's now dried up. Applied for disability for depression, anxiety, etc but that could take up to a year. In the meantime, the social service grant pays $401/month. My rent is $600 including utilities. My landlord served me eviction papers and the court date is for Oct 5. After a devastating flood 6 yrs ago where I lost everything I haven't been able to keep an apartment or job. I lost custody of my son to my mother who did her best to alienate him from me for the first 5 of those 6 yrs. I have had 7 jobs in the last 10 years. I have lived at the YMCA and couch surfed at family member's place. I've had a noose tied up in my closet now for almost a year. A colleague from the tech job tied it for me (he thinks it was a joke).I'm going to lose my eviction case next week. I've been offered a couch to surf on, but I really don't see the point. The people offering are kind, but they are slobs with no hope of improvement. TBH, I'd rather be dead than put myself through that cycle again. "
I'm running out of energy to keep trying :/,"I recently made a pretty big move across the US and started at a new job. Moving and starting a new job like this has been so much work; I just feel so legit overwhelmed. My anxiety has been through the roof and I haven't been able to relax at all. It takes a lot of control to keep myself from just totally freaking out. I feel like I'm starting to lose the will to keep it up. It really is a lot of work. :/ Giving up and just not having any more worries is pretty enticing.
I haven't really felt this suicidal in a while, so it's a little surprising to me. I guess the scariest thing for me is that whether I half-ass it or not, I live by myself, so there wont be rescue coming my way. On the other hand, it will be a long time before anyone finds me. It's kinda morbid to talk about... Idk. Maybe I wont see Thursday evening?My thoughts are so scattered. I don't really know if there's any point to this aside from just expressing it.I feel sick to my stomach. :/Maybe I can just sleep it off."
i need someone to talk before doing something painful,I have no trust friends and i dont know good and trust therapy in my fucked up country and I think about suicide for days nowcan anyone help by hearing me I'm arabic person and I'm intermediate in english
I hate myself...,"People tell me I'm talented, I'm gifted, I'm a ""cool guy""......but I just can't bring myself to ""accept"" those kinds of compliments.I feel like everything I do is bound to end in failure. I'm slipping up in pretty much everything I do at this point, to where I start to ask myself ""why I do even bother continuing to do this?"" I have been told over and over that I'm just not ""good enough"", by teachers and colleagues, that I'm just ""wasting my time"".I personally find myself to be just an annoyance to people. My friends are starting to ignore me more and more and I recently lost a friend after he told me that he didn't want to be around me anymore because he thought I was an annoying twat around him. Making new friends is an extremely hard task for me because I'm very socially awkward, and I don't have many interests in anything these days, which makes it rather hard for me to have much in common with anyone.I don't even think my family cares much about me. My parents don't even say they ""love"" me anymore or show any form of affection. I am always ignored during family meetings. My mom sold my car without my consent and stole $4000 of my financial aid refund for her personal gain.I have tried to talk with others about it, but I never found it helpful. In fact, my depression is actually starting to annoy my friends to where they tell me not to make it a habit, whenever I act up. No one really asks ""what's wrong?"" or ""how can I help?"" They just don't care anymore. Are they really my friends anymore?All this led me to believe that I'm nothing more than just an annoying twat who always fails at ""simple things"" and is just not ""good enough"". I hate myself and I don't understand I even still have friends, or as they so say they are. I've considered suicide many times and attempted it a few times in the past."
I got good news today but one little comment... I just wanna die.,"Finally after months of living in a pop up camper, and years without a job, my mother has informed me that she's gotten us both exactly that. A mutual friend was hanging with us as I was told. I made a comment that my first pay check, ever in my life, I wanna spend it on whatever I want. This mutual friend says, ""that's rude and disrespectful to your mother."" I never ever have been able to spend my own money on anything because I've never had my own money... I just wanted to buy something for myself.. I feel like a piece of shit... I probably won't kill myself. But my body aches like it's begging me to end it all... Since I'm a burden that wants to waste money on myself... I just thought it was self care..."
"If I soldier on, I'll just end up becoming one of those cases of 'my Dad killed himself two years ago'","I'm 21, and my life objectively isn't that bad. I should have an ok career, marry, etc... It's always been a dream of mine to have a little girl of my own, a nice dog... the perfect family life. The problem is that after that then what? The dog dies, the children grow up and leave and at that point I'll finally decide to call it quits, which begs the question "
I won't be around to watch the ball drop into 2018,"I just feel like I have been through enough pain, enough lies, enough betrayal, enough heartbreaks to finally just say fuck it.I had an accident when I was little that caused me to wear prosthetics for life. Years, going in and out of hospitals because of it, limited to certain things I can't do. I can't run, I can't go in the water, I haven't been at the beach in years, I can't do half if not three quarters of the things that  I want to do.
My dream to join the army was crushed because of having a prosthetic. Every time I gave out my heart it was stabbed and abused. Had surgeries where I lost count on how many I had to get on my leg. Last one needed more Skin, so part of it was taken from my left side which one looks like a Shark took a bite out of me. My friends don't hang out with me anymore, all of my exes left me after I gave everything to them. I am just tired of it all.P.S. This is a throwaway account ofcourse."
Bye,I wish I knew how to live. I don't GoodBye
Past few months have been worse than the past few years.,"Discharged from the military in late May. When I got my orders to get out it hit me harder than I thought it would. I'll tell you the story about that if you want to help. Anyway, I get out and go stay with my buddy off post until my family came down to help me move my stuff back home. I got my girlfriend at the time to break up with me by doing something horrible so she would hate me and block me from everything so she wouldn't have to deal with the heartache of me killing myself. Somehow I thought that was better for her. My buddy wanted to go shooting and I thought well this could be easier than I thought. We got in his car and drove over to the range that was about 15 minutes up the road. I was fully prepared to end it as soon as I had the loaded weapon in hand. Then the woman at the register looked down and my buddy had flip flops on and that was a safety hazard so he couldn't go in. We went back to get him some shoes and in the time it took to do that I told myself I would wait it out and see if it gets any better. Fast forward to when I got home it hit me much harder. My nieces were terrified of me. I was a stranger who moved in and they wanted nothing to do with me. I don't blame them because they hardly saw me from any time they could remember me. I never felt at home after that. I sat in my room leaving only to go to the bathroom, shower, or eat. I didn't feel like I knew my family anymore. Never felt like I did after I went to basic, but I only saw them a few times a year so I never thought much of it during that time. Now that I was back it dragged me down even farther. I'd leave later at night while everyone was asleep and buy my booze then. Might as well suppress my thoughts. Now that I have a job when I drive there have, at least what I figure is, the call of the void. I could drive into oncoming traffic. Jump off of the bridge on the way. Stop at the gun range by work. It sucks. I just think I want someone to talk to, because I don't want to kill myself but it hurts every day that I don't. I've never admitted to anyone about these feelings but hey first time for everything I guess.."
I just want to talk without having the police called on me.,"Before you go on to tell me that this doesn't happen frequently- it does. Its happened to me twice and I've been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital twice. The experiences were so traumatic- having disgruntled police officers show up at my door, being locked in a room with three men twice my size in one generic ""adults"" section, the caustic attitude of the nurses- that I swore to never see another mental health professional again.The smug, self-riteous attitude of the people who got me committed (I saved your life though!!!) sickens me. Last week I was going to try out online therapy by BetterHelp, however they completely denied me, saying that in person therapy would help me the most.I'll never get ""help"" again. All I do is lie and suffer alone. I'd rather be dead than be in a fucking psych ward."
I want to commit suicide,"Hello, I recently moved to a new country in the middle east for my year abroad. Everything is going wrong for me here. I have been depressed before but I just can't take it anymore. I want to commit suicide. I don't know what is available for me to get here. I have tried slicing my wrists before and it failed.
I was thinking I could take some rat poison or somethinf like that. There is no place in my room to hang myself from.
I just want to kill myself. My life is full of too much pain.
I wish I could get a gun or something. What ways are there besides a gun or wrist slitting or hanging.
I am just looking for the most efffectivw way. Pleasw help. Thanks"
disconnected from the world,"22 years old, no friends, and a social anxiety so bad I can't hold a conversation even with my own family.

Cutting has made let me release some of that despair but i thinks it's almost time. I made this account just so I could be part of everyone's pain. I can't decide whether I'm going to pop pills and cut deep or just go straight to the laced dope and fall into blackness. "
Everything about being trans sucks,"And I can't handle it at all. I'm trying really hard to pretend that I'm okay. I'm resisting the urge to just end it right now. My family and friends still haven't recovered completely from my previous attempt. UghThe truth is, I know that suicide is not something that I can avoid. I can put it off for a year or two, but that's it.I can't live like this, with my body and my mind permanently disfigured. I don't want to be a fake for the rest of my life, hiding behind makeup and padded bras. I don't want to see a guy in the mirror every single time. I don't want to feel like a pervert every time I try to wear womens underwear. I don't want to shave my fucking hairy chest and nipples every single day. I'm sick of having basically zero options when it comes to dating and making friends. I have no money for the surgeries I need, I have no money to change my documents... It's just all pointless.I just don't get it. What's the point of coping with this shit when I can just end it?"
Want to die because im ugly,blah blah blah rant rant rant
I'm worthless.,"I hate where my life has gone. I'm way too old to be struggling through college. People make passive-aggressive remarks about it. Yet, I still can't seem to stop having trouble. I spend money I don't have and can't seem to stop myself. All I do anymore is sleep, eat, and play video games when I can be bothered to get out of bed. I just want to die so bad. I hate everything and no longer have any friends. They've all stopped hanging out with me and one even told me she doesn't want to talk to me again because I'm depressing. I just want to die."
"I'm done, letting my eating disorder win","Im in my late 20s and have been battling an eating disorder for the better part of a decade. I can't get help because I cannot afford health insurance, and just don't have the energy anymore. All i think about 24/7 is my body and food. I have no friends or support system and am trying to battle this on my own. "
Oh how I just want it to be over.,"I have a good education, I have been a good employee at a fun job, I've tried my best to give where I can, helping those in my life, strangers, and even people on the other end of a hotline. Yet I'm so tired of being alive. I've been a widow for 10 years, as of yesterday, I'm 34 years old, and other than when my close friend got quite handsy when drunk, I've basically been utterly alone since then. I know that I am to blame, at the end of the day regardless of circumstance, I gave up trying. I just accepted I'll be alone around year four, it was easier than dealing with the guilt after my loss of feeling arousal once again. It's a natural feeling, but one I couldn't bear, and it brought me to my knees in that empty home of mine. I have tried to kill myself, right after year two, in a fit of anger and despair. It's funny how the gun jammed, I've had it for years, and it's never let me down once, except for when I truly needed it. Since then I've never been able to reach that point again. I can't bear the thought of making such a mess, and I've never been able to truly find a way to do so without leaving something for someone to clean up. It's the one bit of imagery that's kept me from actually trying again. I've read some of the scripts I use at the call center whenever I volunteer, how to bring someone from a hot moment to a cool one, how to ask questions in a respectful manner, how to create an action plan. I've tried various forms of medication, I've seen a few therapists, maybe I just never let the latter truly work, but I've spent hours and hours, and endless amounts of cash. I've tried what I perceive to be my best. Flipping though my diary entries, it seems like every other day I'm writing about how I wish I was dead. I'm just so tired, I'll never truly have the person I want ever again, and I'm sick of seeing all these happy couples, get married and now talk about their children all the time. There was a time where I'd wish for nothing more than to have my own kids, I've spent many hours thinking of names. It's never something I'll get, but if I truly wanted some, adoption is always an option. But that wasn't the point I was trying to make, however please don't interpret that as diminishing adoption. It really does wear on you, I feel myself getting sicker honestly, every day I just seem weaker and weaker. It's as if I'm just feeling the strain of my grief being trapped internally. I just hate it all, I wish I was dead, I just want it to be over. But I'll sign off tonight, and sadly wake up in the morning to another empty world due to my own stubbornness. It's hell when the reason you're miserable is yourself, and you can't change it. I hope everyone here can at least manage to get a few hours of sleep, rest is so undervalued, and maybe find a way to reduce the reasons for their suicidal feelings. "
I got angry at a bus driver today for not running me over!,"This afternoon at about 3:00pm UK time, I was waiting at the bus stop near my university. I had just finished another day of lectures that was introducing my class to what we are expected to do throughout the year and we watched a film that someone who graduated last year and the film was okay, but very well made for a student film. While I was waiting at the bus stop, as usual, I was thinking about all the shit in my life and how much I've lost confidence and my own self-esteem over the last year and how much I want to end my life. Watching everyone else around town, my own class included, I just felt like I'm inferior compared to everyone else. All those students who look so sure of themselves, they are well-dressed, confident and know their shit! While I'm just a kid in their eyes, I'm just a piece of shit. I'm seen as as someone who they should laugh out, the awkward one, the one who does not fit in, FUCK THEM! So, after calling my dad to say that I'll be heading onto the bus soon and texting my brother telling him that I'll be home in an hour, I saw the bus coming my way, I put my hand out as normal and then, in the moment, I stood on the road and yelled out loud ""Run me over, run me over!"" I knew at that moment that I wanted to die and I was ready to go, I did not want to live this shit life anymore. Everyone just stood around and did nothing as the bus came towards me and it did not seem to slow down so I knew that this was it and I knew that this shit life I've been living for 22 years would be over! Just as I could feel the front window of the bus hit me in the face, I fell down and waited for the wheels to crush me, but the bus did a hard stop and I could hear people screaming. I woke up, seeing a group of people surrounding me, the bus driver included. I tried to run away, but this man in his 30s pulled me back and held me down and said that the police were coming to get me, I struggled and told him that he should have just let me die. The bus driver was mad at me and I got angry telling him that he should have not stopped and run me over. He said after that he would never do such a thing. Anyway, the police arrived and I sat in the car and they talked to me before the ambulance arrived and I was soon brought home. I'm currently in bed, still hating life and I just wanted to write here because no one else cares.    "
"I'm not asking for someone to talk me out of it, i just need help convincing my best friend it's not her fault","It's her fault With that out of the way, how do I convince her that it's not? I love her, but she keeps breaking my heart when she knows every other area of my life has gone to the dogs. It pushed me past my breaking point and tonight, I swallowed pills. I'm going to send her one last text and I don't know what to tell her"
Today is the first day of school and I already want to kill myself.,"for the past 3 years, I worked full time as an engineer and today I finally start grad school in the major I wanted to study in.And I already want to kill myself.My appearance is hideous, I have really small eyes, big nose and eyes that are not behind my eyebrows. I realize I don't care about being a mathematician, I don't care about anything I do in life, I don't care about doing anything for the world. I just want to look normal, or even decent looking and have a happy life.I want to fall in love, I want to go out and take pictures with friends and girlfriend and get marry and do all the things normal people do.I want to be able to love my mom and not blame her for marrying my dad and giving me her small eyes instead of inheriting my dad's big eyes. I want to love my mom and not blame her for ruining my DNA, but I can't, I will never forgive her because I can never forgive her. My suffering is her doing.I don't want to be a freak I don't want to be a freak why am I a freak."
Draining my days on artificial happiness,"I'm at the point where my life is a routine. Work a low paid job, come home lonely, look at facebook, youtube, instagram, feel that artificial happiness that I'm happy for these people but as soon as the tv is off or the laptop is closed or the app is closed, I look around and think to myself, I'm pretty fucking worthless. The quiet room pulsates around my lonely self. I usually spend my weekends curled up in a ball thinking about the potential things in life that I could do. One common one, is dreaming that I'm with the love of my life, travelling the world, looking at the views from a beautiful apartment, then I just use that as a ""mission complete"" logic and that I don't need to accomplish that in real life. I am rotting, almost at the point where I want to barricade the windows up to prevent humanity from contacting me. I'm 21, virgin, never kissed a girl and would probably never want to engage in sex or anything like that. I want to be a clean soul. But just my depression, anxiety has just completely taken over me as well as laziness and I'm just rotting my days after work sleeping in bed. I cannot do this anymore. Even tho it's been 3 years since I left highschool, this routine in my subconscious is very comforatble, but in reality, I'm feeling sick. Whenever I'd go out for a walk, I'd think of terrible things when I see humans walk around, laughter amongst couples going for walks. I feel like harming someone. That's when my evil side comes in.I'd often treat myself to a cafe feeling quite happy that I'm still alone and I pay for my own stuff. I then see couples, at every single table, and theres one reserved for me. I'd hold on to this logic of being single and that I'm so safe alone. But I cannot. I see everyone just laughing, sharking kisses, I want to just shout that life is a lie and start bashing everyone. But it's all in my head. I sit down, breathe out and sip my coffee. A bunch of fucked up thoughts pass my head before I switch back to reality. And by fucked up I mean ways I want to die and people around me.I don't know if I've been controlled by dark anxiety, or I'm just born with a fucking disease which makes me completely hate that fact that there's only one race and that's the human race."
I'm tired of pain,"Once again, I've been dumped. Dumped because she felt she could be happier. She was so happy with me. But felt she could be happier. I'm so tired of feeling this pain every single time. I do everything I can for someone and then I can't make them as happy as they should be. I just want to die. So badly. It's all I want. I just want to leave this world and never have to deal with all of this. I don't care if she still loves me. I just can't handle this. I want death to take me. So badly. I keep dreaming about pulling the trigger and just finally being free of eternal pain with a short burst of pain and then freedom. The nothingness of death seems more appealing than dealing with constant pain from life. I know she still loves me. She just told it to me. But she still decided to demote me to friend. So why even bother if I'm not meant to be happy"
I am going to kill myself today,My ex boyfriend hates me and i am still in love with him. He hates me for not being able to cope up with hr breakup and asking him questions to get closure. I can't take the hatred and pain anymore.
Anyone else just feel tired?,"I just feel tired, like I'm done with life. I'm not sad about anything in particular, but it just feels like it has nothing left for me. I hate this feeling"
just another post,"just another human being who feels worthless. im just your typical worthless loser with no job, pan handles to feed an addiction, living at home now mooching off of a sick parent who has spent more time in a hospital now than a doctor himself. lately i am just counting down the minutes til i get the balls to kill myself."
"I've been fighting my thoughts for two whole years, and it's getting increasingly harder to keep going","There are very few people I can be myself around and feel safe.Outside of those people, which I have not many chances to interact with often, I'm afraid of how people would see me, and yet am uncomfortable with how people currently see me.I have both anxiety and gender dysphoria going on. Both find new ways to screw me over. And both have been building up over this time.I don't know who to talk to about this, because I'm worried that either I won't be taken seriously about this, or that it will be taken too seriously and lead to changes in my life that aren't what I want."
I already hate my life and see no future,"I know everyone says life gets better, but I just don't see it getting better for me. I've been interviewing with companies recently and nothing quite hurts like getting too-cheerful correspondence from a recruiter saying that they don't want you. Especially when hearing about other people's very successful interviews and how many cool places they're flying to to meet companies.I know the response is ""change starts with you!"" or ""something something be the person you want to love"" and maybe that's just too hard for me. I hated who I was when I graduated high school - a bunch of acquaintances and no friends. But the more I look around myself, I see that I haven't actually changed at all since high school. I hate who I am and what I've done with my past few years. I haven't been active in bigname clubs or professional organizations. I know I should ""just start now"" but it's hard. And I just don't want to do hard. The only thing holding me back from killing myself is that it's hard.I guess the problem is that I just want something easy, and life isn't easy. So why can't I just quit? That way it can be like most other hard things I've done. Hahaha"
Suicide is my option,I thought a lot about it and I had very suicidal phases. I'm now at the state again that I am sure Suicide is an option for me. By experience it will get worse in some days and after that I'll be worse than ever before. Since I don't know how I can be worse and still survive I'll be ending it this time. It may sound rational but it is meant as I said it.
Falling out of popularity,"Hey folks. I'm not sure how to format this so I'll just spew words here. It'll sound weird on account of my ADHD and struggle to communicate this stuff. I'll start this in saying that I do my best to make everyone smile. I never find myself smiling but I'll force one to help make others happy. I'll bust my ass to make sure someone feels better if they're down. I won't be overbearing about it, but I'll always be there for them. People liked me for my sense of humor and being quick on my feet with jokes. I was popular around the school for various reasons, some being my constant efforts to help people, my passion in my beliefs, my video gaming skills (yeah, not sure how that got me any points but it did lol), and my participation in politics and theatrical clubs. I would always fight to make sure everyone was happy or at least in a better situation than they were before. I'm told I give really good advice and helped people out. I'm in my senior year of high school. Something has changed. My upperclassmen friends are out of school and too busy to see me often. My in grade friends have pushed me out of their circles, not aggressively, but passively. Underclassmen just don't like me much. I used to have people regularly seek me out and talk to me. My girlfriend left me just a day or so ago, which made me realize how truly alone I was in the school without her. I reach out to people with lukewarm reception. The freshman are following the words of seniors who have never spoken to me and now I can hardly walk through any of their classes without getting called a faggot. Something to note about me is that I have ADHD. Combined with depression, it means my negative thoughts are constantly floating around my head. No distractions, just a constant flow of self loathing. It makes relaying my problems difficult and it makes it hard to seek help. I'm no stranger to suicide attempts, but I always stopped myself as of late because too many people relied on me. Well, now nobody relies on me. Wherever I try to make someone smile or help people feel better they are just bothered. Being a nuisance to people is one of the worst things I could ever be. I talk to people who I've been friends with for years and they're always coincidentally busy. Social media shows them out having a good time, and I know when to take a hint. It sounds like I'm some non-understanding asshole, but it's been a constant trend I've observed this year, even during all of summer. I've found out that I bother a lot of people and am just a general nuisance. People always just put up with me.I've got a lot of dreams. I want to be a politician (yeah, I know, I probably should be dead already with a dream like that.) and to change the country and perhaps even world into a better place. My end goal is to be a senator. I want to have as many people as I can in the country smile. I want to fight for what I believe in and make a positive impact.Well, after finding out I've been bothering everyone in my school this year in one way or another, the only positive impact I could probably make is a bullet in my head. Seriously, I don't know it I'm coming off like a selfish prick here , I'm trying to explain myself but I'm just typing words and they're all over the place. Goddamnit. I walk into school and other social functions and I realize. I finally realize what it's like to truly have  And that hurts beyond words for someone who's main goal is to make people happy. Hell, it hurts for anyone. College is going to be no different as it's in the same county. I've always been cruelly hard on myself. I never give myself credit. I am the first to help anyone, and last to help myself. When asked for positives on myself I find myself always wondering.As for my family , I've been a disappointment to them for years. I love my dad so much, and he works so hard, but I can't remember the last time he's complimented me or told me he was proud of me. Dead serious. My mom nearly bled to death having me when I was born, and I wish every day I could just give all of that back. She is always frustrated with me and I once overheard her talking to my older sister about how she worries if I'll succeed at all. My older sister is like a best friend to me. She and I always joke around and have great trust in one another. Now however, I've just been a thorn in her side. Shes clearly annoyed with me as of late. My little sister has autism. People make fun of her and I feel something my jolly, relaxed self never feels too often; genuine anger. She went to a summer camp this summer and told a counselor that her big bro was ""never there for her"". I fight hard to make sure she's safe in her first year of high school, but I fall woefully short. I'm the end of nearly every joke in the family and not taken seriously often. I've always been unnaturally good with animals and my dogs sleep on my bed every night. They follow me into every room and mirror my every motion. They nearly topple me every time I walk in. But I wonder if the two of them only like me because I'm the one that feeds them. If someone else had the job I'd be quickly forgotten probably.At work I'm not well liked, I always ask about things because I want to be sure the job is done well, despite the fact that I'm Essentially a garbage man for a grocery store. The church people tolerate me but only like my humor. I'm a nobody otherwise. I am a Christian and I hope Jesus still forgives me if I squander the gift he's given me, life. I never pray for myself, only for others.I'm not sure where I'm going with all of this. I'm usually so much more eloquent but I'm in school and just alone as all hell. The thoughts won't leave and I've lost so much ot my drive. I wish I could communicate this stuff better like I can communicate politics stuff for the school politics union. But instead I just sound like a ranting lunatic here. I've let everyone down as of late and can't make anyone happy like I used to. My upperclassmen buddies I mentioned are probably better off without the baggage of someone who is losing relevance fast and who's regularly just caused them issues. Really, I've probably done nothing of note for anyone no matter how hard I try. I don't tell people much about this as I don't want to be tossed into some institution. I'll end this with an apology, I'm sorry you guys had to read this nonsense. I'll probably be much more eloquent and make much more sense in the comments. I'm really sorry. EDIT: reading this over, it really is a bunch of gobbledygook. Nobody has to reply if it doesn't make enough sense. Sorry for the mess."
I'm so depressed I just rage.,"I don't know what to do anymore. I've never hit anybody else out of anger but it's just too much. I'm always turning it in on myself but its gotten to the point where I'll just rage for no reason at all. If I drop a can on the counter I just start punching myself in the knee or my head. I just have all this anger and I can't get rid of it. I used to chop wood, punch a punching bag, tear apart junk and just hit myself, but it never goes away. I'm sad and frustrated and just angry. I don't want to be like this but I don't know a way to shut out this incessant self hatred. At work I'm quiet but in my head I just scream at everything and hate myself. I think about killing myself just to shut it out at this point."
my turn,"From time to time I've responded to people here, using different accounts.  It did no good, but I never do.  I am the most stupid ugly worthless piece of shit the world has ever known.  Everyone has left, no one wants me around.  If I could just leave my ass, I would too.  I take 100% responsibility for the life I made for myself, and I'm so fucking glad it's over."
Contemplating suicide today,"Well I don't know where to turn and have absolutely no one to talk to so i decided to subscribe to this forum, but I couldn't read one post with bursting into tears. It's like life is piling on top of me and I'm drowning and no one is trying to help. I failed out of my first year of college, which I think is the reason I'm always getting the third degree from my mom. One morning I woke up and heard her telling my siblings not to ever be like me. She'll show off all my other siblings and just forget about me. But background information, I failed out of my freshman year of college because I was getting so high I never went to class, yes this is my own fault and I absolutely blame no one but myself. I went through this horrible break up. My SO told me I was insecure, had no backbone, foolish and all sorts of things to hurt me. He left me because I'm not good for him, so my coping mechanisms were to get high and drunk. I was on a binge for weeks, missing classes, assignments, not talking to anyone, locking myself in my dorm, etc. I left college with no intentions on going back because my mental health is that bad. My mom moved to VA while I was still in school in PA. So for the summer I stayed with my aunt but we got into a big argument and she kicked me out so I had no choice but to move here with my mom. We've never had a good relationship so I already knew things would get worse. I've been battling with depression since 2013, declining medication because my first time on medicine I attempted suicide. But this year is by far my worst year with depression. I also have really bad anxiety, I have a tremor, and a rare sexual condition called vaginismus. So all these things triggers my depression. Since I've been in VA, I feel like a soul that's just levitating, watching myself sulk in pain and misery. I also feel like I'm lagging behind all my peers and people that are close in age with me. I'm currently struggling to find a job and my mom hangs that over me daily, and I can tell she's getting frustrated as the days go on but it's hard to be positive and believe in myself when she constantly puts me down and tells me I'm not capable of anything. I watch the people I've graduated high school with, enjoying life and moving forward and I can't even get pass step one. My mental health is deteriorating everyday, I can feel myself losing my mind. And recently all I've ever thought about was killing myself. I contemplate it a lot, and I just know one day it's gonna happen. And I feel like when I'm gone, it's like ive never even existed. That's how meaningless I feel in this world."
Birthday Blues,"I just turned twenty. I'm still living at home, attending community college, and I'm 100% clueless on what to do with my life. Every opportunity for progress is wasted on me. I can't hold the responsibilities of a normal person, I can't have a regular work schedule or a normal load of classes. I feel trapped, but even if I escaped, where would I go?My fear of being caged is second only to my fear of getting out. I'm so incredibly terrified and tired of all the work."
Why I want to just end everything,"In no particular order:I am short. I am unattractive. I have social anxiety. I can't make friends. I have never been in a relationship.I have wasted my youth. My grades could be better. I have a few talents.I have a few accomplishments.I have very few friends.I have lost all interest in new things.I have lost interest in getting a hobby.I have lost interest in my old hobbies. I can't get a girlfriend to save my life.I am depressed all the time. I have lost so much sleep. I feel dead inside. I can't feel emotions. I have no social life. My parents are strict and closeminded.I am a financial burden to them. I feel as though others are living greatly and I am in a glass cage.I feel as though my parents are ashamed. I don't if I should be religious or not.That's what I can think of right now.
There are probably a few more."
I am so close to killing myself...,"I have been having suicide thoughts for a while now. I feel like I am becoming person I hate. I use to be so optimistic and patient. Lately, I am starting to lash out and my throat hurts from sobbing uncontrollably. I hate feeling this way. I deserve to get knocked up early because I'm useless. I have no talents, stupid, and nothing really redeeming. I have a 3 year old son and his communication is slow. My mother and Mother in law scorn me and blame me since after I am the stay-at-home mother. I have given up my hobbies and do my best to talk/ask question/ teach my son. But it's obvious he's not like the other children we meet. My husband worked 12 hours, rotating shift so on his days off he is so tired and just plays WoW. I told him how I have been feeling and he got hurt that it felt like he and my son didn't matter to him. I feel my husband just settled for me because his first choice didn't want to commit to him. My family are estrange to me because I am a failure. I have been coming up with plans of way to just end it...The one thing that has been stopping me is my rescue dog that we got little more than 3 months ago. He's a good boy.. I know if I pass away, he's a high-energy dog so my husband would only surrender him back at the shelter. My son deserves a better mother, my husband will have no problem picking up another wife. Maybe my dog can have a better owner. "
I've taken a bit already,I don't know if tonight's the night to go thRough with it. I feel okay right now the painkillers help with the emotional pain but I know I'm th morning I'll regret not going through with it. I feel so excruciating guilty I need to go
Don't want to face sexuality,"My sister is out now, and I'm so proud of her, but I've been hiding this forever and I wanted to just keep on hiding it forever. But I get all weird when I talk about her. I don't want people to think I don't accept her, because I do. I just don't accept myself. I don't want to. I don't want to come to terms with it. I honestly just want to die. I would rather die than deal with this."
My parents say I'm incapable of being a decent person and I should get it over with already and kill myself.,"I know they're right. I'm incapable of moving out and as long as I'm living with them I'm going to keep ruining their lives. What right do I have to ruin the lives of everyone around me and be nothing but a burden every day? I think it's time to give up. I think I need to go. edit: I just don't know the best way to go about everything. I have friends I promised I'd reach out to first but I don't think I can tell them. I think if I don't tell them, they might never know I'm gone, that might be easier... I don't know what to do. I love them. I don't know. "
master procrastination.,I've been putting off all of my responsibilities for about a week now and it's really fucking me. it's just hard to do anything when i spend most of my time hating myself. i can sit for hours and just think about how much i want to end it all. then i just fall asleep and start thinking about it again when i wake up. i can't even remember most of what happened today. i can just remember all of the reasons i came up with for why i should kill myself. i don't want to live anymore if this is just going to be the rest of my life. I'm fucked.
Just wanted to say i feel a lot better.,"Never really post but my life has been shit for the past year or two and I have finally excepted that life is what it is. I can only strive to be the best me I can and I'm done with the self pity and loathing. I'm going to do whatever makes me happy regardless of what people think of me. I have been reading lots of articles and it turns out nothing matter in the grand scheme. We choose to make our meaning ourselves no one else can do it for us. Even the ""self"" is an illusion. Our cells completely are completely replaced every ten years. The I is just a still freeze frame of the transformation my body makes all the time. There is no soul all ""i"" am is a stack of memories of people telling me who I am and me reinforcing it by telling myself who I am, what I like, what my name is nationality...etc. But it doesn't matter because it's all okay. I'm going to be me even tho I am an illusion. Killing myself is not the answer. Even tho I look at old pictures, feeling a disconnection, I realized that that isn't actually me. It was someone else who transformed slowly overtime to become ""me"" today. I have some of that person's memories and during the transformation to current ""me"" I have been reinforcing the idea of a ""me"". I'm not going to kill myself because there is no me to kill.  If you break it down, everything is the same down to the atom level so I might as well be a tree or TV right???  I'm really happy that I have made this realization as I have decided to revert "" myself"" back to my natural state. Within a minute or two of this post being posted I will be reverted back to what ""I"" was and always will be and still am. Just a concept. Except, the concept of me will only be remembered by those closest to me for a few years maybe and then ""I"" will be forgotten"
Just another thing in my miserable life,"I just feel like dying right now. A lot of things add up at the moment.. I'm failing exams, too lonely, didn't really took care of my teeth and so on..
Now my recent story... I met an amazing girl..went on three dates with her..she was having a great time - laughing at my stupid jokes, very touchy and so on
But now, the retard that I am, didn't go for a kiss or anything at all while she was basically throwing herself at me..said we should see a movie at her place someday... and so on
Now she's obviously not interested in me anymore and blocked me.
I know there are more girls out there but she was the only in years to show interest in me and I'm fucking 25...
I'm not ugly but have the social skills of a flabby marshmallow so I won't meet another girl for quite some time now.
I'm not going to end my life at least for now ..just wanted to let it out because I feel like crying but can't :-(
thanks for reading..it means a lot to me since I have nobody to talk to :-)"
I think im going to kill myself,"I'm so alone. I dont know what to do. I just want some love and affection from some one and I can't find it anywhere. I just cant build connections with people. I think this is it, i think im going to do something about it soon. I cant handle this anymore. I have very little sense of purpose. All i want is to be loved. If i died no one would care. Why does no one care about me?"
"Well, It Just Seems Correct","I must say firstly I am destined to die anyway, so does it really matter if I kill myself? Regardless, I am utterly talentless and commonly disliked. Some may like me at first, like how many people seem to have had romantic feelings towards me. However they later become just like the others disliking me as well. I am in college currently on the clock to fail out. I am so irresponsible I have to weigh everyone else down with my wants. I hate realizing everyday that I am just on to fail and feel the displeasures I commonly feel on a repetitive and truly dulling cycle. I constantly have an internal battle where I tell myself I don't seek respect, that I am logical and complete in my reasoning on the matters of morality and that my emotions don't blind me. I try to justify my selfishness as human even though I am all to sure that I am weak and far too childish which may be the only reason I have these thoughts. I hate others most likely because they have gained more and I am truly jealous. When I think I have made a decision I can never commit to it. I know there is so much wrong with me, I can never determine what and how to diagnose who I am. I feel as though I have Antisocial Personality Disorder and I don't feel sympathy or compassion. Then I feel others pain and enjoy it, other times I feel their pain come to me and can't tell what I feel for their misfortune. Sometimes I feel I might slightly care, then later I realize it was only that they gave me attention so then on I wish them the worst after they can longer give me this. No one has ever been able to tell me what is wrong with me. I know I have a mental barricade that I created in the past so I never really know what I think. It was made to keep others from finding me. In the process I lost myself. I try to visualize experiences of pain in incidents of interrogation and try to rationalize my ability to experience the pain, also slightly enjoying it as it reconnects me to the animals we are and the thrill of someone wanting me harmed. Humans are so fucking fake and I have been lied to all my life. I hate how humans lie to themselves and as a result lie to me. I think about trusting someone but soon see them hurting me and that they have their limits and will never be truly subservient. I considered existing just to make others feel pain, then though I considered how that was childish and it wouldn't matter. I feel as though I dislike drug usage because I wanted them but people didn't treat me well and never gave me them. Sometimes I can't tell if I hurt other or if I just wish I did. I might just dislike drugs because I couldn't get them and people treated me poorly. I might just be a misogynist because girls never liked me. I thought I liked animals but it is becoming easier and easier for me to hurt them. I also can't tell if I am gay, the thought of loving a guy scares me as I would be completely vulnerable to them. With girls I feel I could never love them so I wish to be straight. Then I am not sure if this would be good as many will likely tell me I am bigoted only as an extension of my shortcomings. Such as not being able to have sex with a girl so hating them for that reason. I am simply a creation that entertains god, a living relegation of contradictory traits. I hate when others tell me I am weaker, I hate knowing that if someone wanted to claim value from me they certainly could and that I am powerless to hurt them or destroy their value. I am limited there are always more capable people in this competitive world. I don't as much fear pain I feel, it is more the thought of others proving themselves and growing progressing off of me."
I wish i was brave enough to finally do it,"I have been abused all my life, I just want it to be over it, i just want to stop feeling pain.I have never met anyone that didn't eventually mistreat me, at this point i'm convinced there's no hope of me ever having a happy life.I wish i had the guts to end my life, but it seems i am far too coward and spineless to even do that, no wonder everyone despises me."
I can't do this anymore.,"Everyday is hard... but this was bad. This morning it started off with no text from him... which I expect, but it still hurts. Why did he bother getting a secret text app, so his current g/f doesn't see, so that he barely talks to me... just to keep me on edge? He knows I'm hurting, he knows about all the physical/emotions shit I've gone through this year (FOUR breakups), but doesn't seem to care. Yet I crave his attention. Texting him asking if there's still a chance is SO HARD not to do!Then my cramps started... fuck they hurt. Then of course my spasms start... I have Stiff Person Syndrome and Isaac's Syndrome and it causes 24/7 muscle spasms (in my case in my feet, legs, hands and throat.... to where it feels like I'm choking) THEN I get nausea from all the fucking pills I'm taking.
Then I get into a stupid fight with a redditor, and I feel like crap about it. I succumb to taking sleeping pills to try and get some relief. I dream about him. I wake up to cramps and spasms.... I just want to see a text from him. Can't stop crying. Tomorrow will be on repeat (except fighting). I have nobody to talk to except my cat.
I want to buy a gun.I can't do this anymore."
I want to hang myself,cant do this anymore
I fucked up,"I said something wrong. Now all my friends have abandoned me, people constantly hate me and it's driving me insane. I just wanna go back in time and fix it, now I have nothing left. Everyone important in my life has disowned me, I just wanna die."
not yet suicidal but getting there,"Hi, I posted here a month ago, things gotten better after that but now shit is coming back. Im 19 years old, failed to pass high school for 2 years and now following a program for adults. I regret alot these days, telling me how I could have gotten out of school with a diploma 2 years ago if studied properly. I set my sight on a college I wanted to apply after I highschool but now I'm stuck at this program for 2 more years. The regret builds up, I read about going to college at the age of 21 is normal but thinking of spending 2 years here just make me depressed. People I know, acquantainces even people I call friends are studying at univerisity or higher education. And by the time I get out of school, others are already graduated. It makes me feel pitiful. I have to wake up at 6 every day to take buses. Winter is coming and its a struggle to get up. I find its hard to get motivated to study. I get home late everyday, home is not soothing either. I met old classmates today and talked to them. They said they were at university makes me feel super bad to look at them and keep up the with conversation. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to study and get good grades so that I can get out asap. But the thoughts of being kept there for 2 years makes the study unmotivating. I feel tired, this is my last chance at school, if I fcked this up even my first year, I'm done for, mentally and physically. Going to school keeps making me think about mistakes I made in the past and I feel angry with myself all the time. Please talk to me, enlighten me, guide me, I really feel a big burden of the past mistakes and the upcoming challenges. "
I keep imagining killing myself.,"Long story short, I'm a struggling student, at risk of being retained this year. I keep worrying about failing the exams, and I even considered killing myself should I fail. I kinda walked back on the latter, thinking I'll get a job as a cook or something. Still, thoughts of me slitting my neck, jumping to my death, overdosing on pills, they stay, and they're inferring with my mind."
I just need someone to talk to.,Here I am if you want to talk :)
A candle.,"I feel like I'm a candle, it's easy to keep the fire alight when you're stopped and protected against the wind, but when you're try to move the difficult turn hellish, and when you go outside the lightest breeze can kill your fire. But even with all the protection you need a candle still ends and I feel that I'm almost done. "
"I found how I'm going to kill myself if I do. It's become a thing where I know I'm going to do it no and I think about it very casually. I'm getting less and less scared to do it, and that's what's scaring me",I know the feeling. And it scares me too.
downside to committing suicide:,"now I have to find foster homes for my pets because my family likes to physically abuse animals, and I actually care for my pets."
next,I'm gonna move my next suicide attempt to tonight.
Tonight I held a loaded gun to my head and my heart just to see what it felt like. I felt nothing. Nothing that made me pull the trigger and nothing that made me scared. I was completely numb. I just stared at it.,"As someone who has fired multiple different types of firearms, nothing is what everyone feels when holding a firearm. There is no excitement no fear, just nothing. It is common."
Today....,I am either debating on going back to the hospital for the fifth or sixth time or just jumping in front  of a train.
I just want everyone around me to die so I can as well.,"Maybe I should just be selfish and kill myself first. If they don't want to live with the pain of my death (I don't understand why anyone would care, but I guess they do anyway), they can do the same. Why should I be the one who puts in all the effort to fit in when I don't even want to be here?"
"I want to die, but my girlfriend...","I want to die, I want to hang. I�۪ve explained myself to my girlfriend, not to control her, not to get anything out of her. Just so she knows what I want to do, the dilemma is she is in university and is leading a super good life, but she said to me that she would kill herself if I did, I obviously don�۪t want that at all. It�۪s the only thing keeping me back, someone give advice, she would get over me in time and start the family she speaks of with me with someone else, maybe that�۪s me being naive? Would I be better breaking up with her so she doesn�۪t look at fault, I�۪m stuck. "
Emotionless,"I dont feel any emotion right now, I can tell I need to cry but Ive been physically unable to for hours. I feel like Im gonna snap somehow"
Not sure when but i feel it's close.,I'm hanging out with a friend tonight. But right now work sucks co-workers suck life sucks. I just don't feel as though I'm living life the way I'm meant to.
Ever want to kill yourself because you can't be friends with someone?,"I can't be friends with someone. =(I can't vent about it either.  Her friend used to say ""delete this"" but now she says its ok but they won't like it.  And she says she ""knows all about the Reddit thing.""  She keeps threatening me a lot saying that her dad is a cop this is her final warning and she'll get me into trouble if I mention her again or something idk.I've imagined killing myself a lot over not being her friend though.  I have such a nice Nephew and a Niece and my mom is going to die soon and my dad takes me out places...  Why can't my friend appreciate that at least ;-;?  Why does everyone want me arrested?  My Nephew and everyone would be sad..  My Nephew really is a nice person..  ;__;..My dad keeps asking me why I look so sad down all the time, but this is all I can think about..I wish I could be friends with this person I know..  I was friends with her again on tumblr two years ago after my ex-friend made me look bad to her..  then I made mistakes and she accepted my apology..then I made more mistakes and she vented about it to my ex-friend and not me and I'm not allowed to talk to her and I wish I could be her friend ;-; I feel bad and I just wish I knew a way to be their friends and for her to not think I'm a creepy stalkerI keep wanting to kill myself and jump off the upper balcony and stuffMy Nephew would be sad if I got arrested, why does everyone want me gone,I hate the life at this house and I really wish I was friends with her, but I can't be"
there is no hope left,"Even if i win the lottery, even if i get a life i have always wished for , even if i would get a girlfriend, a family, a happy life i will never be truly happy, i just want to die , i just want death, nothing else ,just death i cant imagine a life where i could be happy, it feels so alien"
I decided to commit suicide,"I chose the date to be my birthday, I'm gonna make it seem like I fell from a six story building (but I don't think that's gonna kill me? is it?) I'm not gonna leave any note, I have a few more weeks but I think my time has come.Edit: I'm a seventeen year old girl, I was born and raised in a very strict family, my teacher phycially abused me for three years with the knowledge of my parents, after that I got bullied for a full year and got death threats (parents said to not fight back) after that I started turning into some kind of bully myself and hurt so many people who used to be my friends, but then I apologized and stuff,and then I entered highschool and got bullied even more, (they emptied the trashcan over my head and then like no one wanted to talk to me or smt) I started self harm but was afraid someone would find out (even though it was on my thighs, and I'm not allowed to wear shorts or skirts or watev) you'd think the reason for the suicide would be all the abuse and bullying and childhood memories, but no, it's actually me. I could've fought back to those bullies, I could've been stronger, but all I turned out to be is weak and weird and depressed. I've been counting the number of ppl I talk to on a daily basis for the past few weeks and the max number is seven :))))Oh and before I finish, we don't have ""clubs"" I could join in my school, we don't have school counseling, I don't have friends, my father doesn't believe in psychology (he believes in violence...) I can't move out once I'm 18 because bruh it's the middle east. The only good thing I hope my suicide will bring is freedom for my other sister who really deserves a better life. "
Is suicide a choice?,You 2 cents.
"It's 2am, how long would it take them to find me?","'Sad' seems like such a ridiculous word to describe us. You can be sad you finished the last of the Pringles. But this, this is physically suffocating. Wanting to be dead, wanting to stop doing anything, ever again, is something else. I've walked I don't know how far in this town, wishing more than anything I've ever wished for, that some thug or junkie would come out from the shadows and end this pathetic life. I've been sitting on the side of the road, crying for an hour.
I've cried so hard that something hurts in my abdomen, it's a pain I've never felt before. I hope I ruptured something. I hope that some disgusting fluid is making its way into parts of my body that can't handle it, and poisons it. I'm making sounds crying that I've never heard, and it hurts. I just want to be done here. I don't want to be 'sad' anymore. I don't want to be anything anymore"
I�۪m a shit person.,"I�۪ve thought about suicide multiple times throughout at least the past 2-4 months, if not more, because I feel like all I do is hurt people. I feel like all I do is make them angry and it hurts me. I rarely ever tell my parents about it because I feel like not only will they not understand, but I�۪m scared that they�۪ll force me to come back to their place or something, despite me not being under their legal guardianship.I�۪ve tried telling a friend about how I feel I don�۪t deserve to live because I honestly feel like all I do is hurt people and make them angry, and she tells me, ���It�۪s never too late to change.�۝Okay, what can I do to change? What am I supposed to do to change? Change what part of me? Break what habit? Because her answer is so goddamn vague that I can�۪t even figure out what it means.I can�۪t tell my mom about it because I know she�۪ll also just tell me to ���get off the Internet and focus on IRL things�۝, but I can�۪t do that, because whether I�۪m online or not, I still get thoughts telling me that I�۪m a horrible person, that I deserve to die, that people would be better off.I don�۪t know what is going on with my brain or in my brain right now, but at this point I�۪m wondering whether or not I�۪m a worthy person to even exist anymore."
Going to kill myself at school tomorrow,"I'm facing expulsion for the act of ""committing"" sexual assault to multiple girls that I hardly know. My school doesn't believe me, and I don't want to face my parents when they find out - I'm innocent, but I'm a pussy. I don't really want to kill myself, I wanted to move to America, start a family, etc. I had plans. I'm a good student, academically. But this fucks it all up. Some of my closest friends don't believe me, and my social life has gone down the drain. There's no way out of this. I've given up on school and governmental organisations.I really love some of the people in my life, including my 3 year old sister, and some of the people I know. It pains me to do this, but it's the only way out. How can I kill myself, quickly and relatively painlessly? Preferably at school, so I can do it in a cubicle and my parents don't have to see me dead like that.Also, if any of you are Catholics, as am I, please pray for me and my salvation. I'm going up to God tomorrow. EDIT: Thanks so much for your messages. I'm alive. Parents are supportive. No verdict from school atm."
I'm worried I'm becoming suicidal,"this must be like my 5th reddit account (deleted it) but tldr, breakup (8 months ago), self esteem goes really low, and everyday I'm telling myself I'm a piece of shit. It's eating away at me.I started to lurk  and recently began to think about it again. It sounds nice to not be a burden on anyone, especially myself, any longer. But I'm scared to kill myself. Sounds like something I'd regret, and very painful.I'd hurt people around me too. Probably my mom the most. I don't want to do that. She's fought hard for me and loves me. So does my cat. Maybe my friends will care for a few months. I don't know. They'll move on eventually.I follow the advice I've read and try to tell myself positive things. I always counter it with something more negative though.I'm getting scared that if I keep my mindset like this, it's going to continue getting worse and I'm going to actually kill myself one day. I don't know who to talk to though. I feel pretty lonely, contrary to my situation. And I feel like, perhaps I'm pretending to be suicidal for attention. Maybe I'm a shit person like that. Better to just keep it bottled up than to hurt someone.I don't know. My problem's tiny compared to other people, but it feels nice to let it out on this post."
I don't know what to do about my friend,"So my friend and I have been best friends since the first year of middle school. Since then we've gotten really close, and spent a lot of time together, but he has never really opened up to me about anything personal one way or the other.
I found out recently that he had been cutting and having suicidal thoughts for a while now, which he let slip over the course of a few conversations, but always refused to talk about it further. Whenever I ask him if he is ok he always says he is, but he obviously isnt. He never wants to tell me anything. He's also been doing a lot of drugs, but I'm not as worried about that.
I am worried that he doesn't feel like he can tell me these kinds of things. I feel like I have failed him as a friend somehow, because I am his closest friend that lives anywhere nearby and I can't help him.
I really don't know what to do. I don't want to force him to talk about it if he doesn't want to, but I also care about him more than most people in the world and want him to be happy, and I don't think doing nothing will cut it. I don't want to refer him to the school cuz he probably won't tell them anything, he'll deny everything and hate me for it. What do I do?"
I want to tell her that I won't do it but I want to end it all so badly,"I want to message her and thank her for everything. For being okay with the school asking her to be my buddy and sending me homework. Asking me if I'm okay even though I could never respond truthfully because I didn't want to worry her. But it hurts too much... it's so hard holding it in at times...I just want to end it all. I'll never amount to anything and all I can do is hurt people. No wonder all my friends left me. I'm selfish, short-tempered and arrogant. I regret everything. If only I had one more shot to do things right.I just don't know what to do..."
I have a problem,"Hi guys. I wanted to tell someone about my experiences im having. a few years ago I went to a WWASP school and I, like many of the other students, was abused. I remember pretty much all of my experiences there pretty vividly, however, I think something happened there that I dont remember. Let me explain, every night, or nearly every night, I wake up from a nightmare, I think its a nightmare, I never remember it. When I wake up I am terrified, my hearts racing and I feel genuine, REAL fear. I have gotten used to it but its really taking a tole on my mental state. I am constantly depressed and when I am around other people I feel anxious and scared to be around them. One night a few weeks ago, I went to the garage, grabbed a rope and a bucket and went across the street to a field with a big tree, and I hung the rope and was standing on the bucket with the rope around my neck and I feel like I woke up. I didnt feel in control the entire time I was going to kill myself. It was so strange. I sat on the ground next to the tree and listened to some music for a while. Since then my depression and suicidal thoughts are getting far far worse. Now, to keep myself looking forward to something, ANYTHING at this point I keep buying things off amazon. I know it sounds stupid but it seems to work for now anyway. I cant get to a doctor and Im not on any medications. My situation leaves me pretty isolated except to go to college and come home. I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just wanted to tell someone. I dont really have any friends so I guess this is the next best thing. "
"I don't think I can do the ""life"" thing anymore","I never thought I�۪d be writing a post here. I always thought I was strong. I always thought it wouldn�۪t get to this. But everything�۪s changed, I guess. My anxiety is so bad, I don�۪t think I WANT to live with it anyone. Anything that I could possibly worry about, I worry about. My anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and I convince myself I�۪m having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit. I�۪m only 16 years old. I shouldn�۪t be living like this. I should be like other girls, just carefree. My anxiety was a lot better for awhile, but it�۪s taken a turn for the worse and I don�۪t wanna live with it anymore. All my friends do is get mad at me and it makes me feel SO shitty. I put my parents through so much shit. I�۪ve had little mini mental breakdowns. I barely have a relationship with my dad. I love my mom so much. All my mom does is worry about me and she does so much for me and i�۪ve treated her so shitty in the past and it makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate that I always worry her. I know it would just be better if I was dead and gone and didn�۪t exist because then I wouldn�۪t be causing her pain. 2 kids that live on my street have killed themselves i know she's scared for me and doesn't want me to feel like that and think i need to commit suicide. I hate that I feel this way. I hate that i just wanna free her from the pain that is me. I don�۪t wanna feel this way. I don�۪t wanna feel anymore. I just wanna be gone. I wanna be free from this pain. I'm crippled. I'm drowning."
Thought on happiness,"Sorry for bad English, I am not a native speaker.
....
Recently I find myself in a situation that I can have anything, I just star med school, that has always been my dream.
I made some real friends not people that just there in the good times, they have help me a lot.
I don't really worry about money, yeah I wish I could have more but I can live a very good student life.
But it wasnt always like that, for the past year I struggle for an alcohol addiction, use some drugs and I lost contact with my family I was alone in every possible way. I tried to kill myself, the first time it just fail but the second one, the only thing that stop me was that the day I planned to do it, I get a call for a job, it was in a school (teaching other languages) so i choose to teach.
Then suddenly I just decide that I could do it better so I put away all alcohol and stuff like that.
I feel very good, I think I was in a good way, all the things star working out (those little children really help me), my family start talking me again, meet really good people.
But the thoughts about killing myself just keep coming back, every little problem I just start thinking about doing, and I just feel that I am not worth it of life, I'm tired, I don't sleep.
I wanna help people but I can't help myself. I really think about going back to alcohol or something like that to stop me thinking about it.
Or maybe I'm really newbie about happiness that I don't know how to feel about it.
Thank you for reading this, I just felt that I have to put it out of my system. "
Someone Else,I hope someone else kills me because I'm too lazy to do it myself and I'm almost certain I can't buy a gun. I want to move to an area where natural disasters happen too. When my mother texts and drives I don't tell her to put the phone down. No more point in progressing and even as I type this I push myself closer to suicide... I'm tired..
I didnt mean to come here i dont know where else to go.,"Hi sorry for this i dont think im going to kill myself i just really want to stop existing for a long time, not feel anything, not matter, like being dead without being dead.Im struggling to even go through with even typing this i just want to say ""fuck it"" and forget about it, because im on the brink of just closing this page and not posting ill just dump it all out in detail.Everything was fine, then mum left dad, dad cried after losing 40yrs of marriage, all my siblings took it very hard, little sister took up smoking, older sisters husband had a child with her then emotionally abused her and ran away overseas, money troubles with me and my gf of 10 years, works fine but dont like it that much, depression is coming back hard i get anxiety attacks and severe depression symptoms like i have never had before, get back on meds AGAIN and do the whole thing AGAIN, mum acting like a fuckwit all the time my siblings hate her, i get migraines now more 80% of the day, now teeth are hurting, turns out all 4 wisdom teeth need to be extracted, all havent emerged yet, need surgery and anethestist to get them out its going to cost like 5000$ unless i get a health fund and wait a whole year i could maybe cut that in half, might have to live a year in pain, someother stuff is wrong i cant remember it all anymore just more and more just getting kicked while im down ive never done anything worng i just be nice and try to be helpful, karma obviously isnt real but it would be nice if it was, getting fucked harder and harder it doesnt let up now the little things bring me down further than before i just want to be left alone. now just tonight i got scammed out of a bunch of CSGO items that were probably worth hundreds, feel like an idiot for falling for it, was really convincing and steam support is a labyrinth of bullshit i just want to email them or something i just want tsomeone to tell me what to do, was frustrated and gf paused her tv show to talk to me but i couldnt explain or get any emotions out, i pressed play on the show and said to just watch the show, she got upset and now we just yelled at each other over nothing, a fucking misunderstanding so i feel ever dumber now and i was just looking out the window at the bush (forest) and was  close to just walking in a straight line into it and not stopping until my feet were bleeding.so now im on a game im going to stay up all night and turn up to work fucked tomorrow and probably piss off my gf again in the afternoon.just realised i guess i should go and see my general practitioner again and start seeing the psyc AGAIN because im never going to escape it and im 24 so if i dont die i have 60 more years or so of this utter catshit that happens every fucking day."
I know my worth. But what's the point of no one else sees it?,"I'm a really smart person. I know at least a little bit about everything. I could point out any country you name on a map (and I mean any). Im actually a fairly attractive guy. I'm not hard to get along with either. I'm really nice and genuine and I'd go so far out of my way to help. But what's the point if no one sees it? Why don't my co-workers see it? Why don't my friends see it? I always had a dream. I've channeled it through learning different languages. Learning different cultures. Planing trips around the world. Watching shows and anime. I always wanted a group of friends who loved me. I dreamt about that since I was a kid. Having friends to go to anytime. I longed for it and I channel it to this day through other means. It just seems pointless. The same scenario runs through my mind everyday. I want to go to Salt Lake City (I don't know, I've always wanted to go to Utah for some reason) and watch my favourite show one last time all the way thought then put a gun in my mouth. Maybe watch it over 2 or 3 days in a hotel and then do it. Just to feel emotions one last time. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I kicked drugs but I've been abusing alcohol for months now. Do you know what it feels like? To feel like you could accomplish anything but no one would acknowledge it? Do you know what it's like to dream of something since you were a kid only to realise life passed you by because of your mental illness?"
Last try,"At some point, you have to call it quits. If this doesn't work out, I'm done. Can't do it anymore. Been working hard for like two and a half years and things haven't gotten better. The pain and dissapointment is still here and I don't want to deal with it anymore.Last chance. "
I don't want to feel anything anymore,"In the past week everything I loved has gone to hell. My grandmother is sick and dying, I'm on the brink of being kicked out of my house, I lost my job, and most recently, my girlfriend of over a year broke up with me because she says everything between us is too monotonous. I've felt so many emotions, too many at one time, I just want it all to stop. I don't want to go through my life feeling like an unappreciated dirtbag. I can't go on with everything swirling through my head, I just can't. "
It's not that I want to die... More like I just don't want to be alive anymore.,"Not a day goes by where I just wish I was dead.So here's the story...About three months ago, my fianc̩ was killed in a car crash while on a road trip with her dad. She died 2000 miles away from me, and the sonofabitch who killed her is still alive. My life has fallen to absolute hell ever since.She was everything to me. Every single thing I did, I did for her. We'd been together for 15 years. We had plans. We were going to buy a house, finally get married in Hawaii, and start our family. All within the next year or so. She just got her Nursing Degree. High School sweethearts. She's the only woman I've ever been with and happily so. Then some stupid fuck in an over-sized pickup truck plowed its way through her car and three others and took her from me.It should have been me. I'm the one with poor health. I'm the one with a darkness inside him that only she could quell. I'm the one who, if not for her, would probably been in prison by now. She was Good. Capital ""G"". Not an unkind bone in her body. She was a nurse, for fucks sake. She dedicated her life to helping others. I'm sitting here, a next-best-thing-to-sociopathic alcoholic with anger issues who she chose to love. And I'm alive and she's not. What the fuck kinda' universe do we live in where that's the outcome?Now my existence has no purpose. I have no direction. No meaning to my life. The love of my life was taken from me at 29. There's nothing left for me here. She was literally my whole world.So now I'm living with my parents again. Both of them joining my grandpa on the path of senility and/or dementia, not sure which. My dad is slowly losing his once sharp-as-a-tack mind, and my mom is getting more and more loopy by the day. They're all I have. I was never one to have many friends, and my family is tiny, relative to most. Soon I'll have no one.There is literally one person in this world whose presence makes things at least okay for a little while, and she's the busiest person I know. I'm lucky if I get to see her once in three weeks. She's my oldest friend, and she cares for me, but she simply doesn't have time for me. Things are... close to okay, when she's around, but that's... very rare.So here I sit. Her (my late fianc̩'s) family telling me ""You'll always be family to us"" and shit like that, but life goes on for everyone else. I'm stuck in this hell and everyone else gets to just keep living their lives.Think I'll wait until the wrongful death lawsuit is over, then find the guy and kill him. Slowly. Then, either take my own life, or death by cop or inmate. Haven't really figured out the details yet.So yeah. Pretty down. Not seeing a lot of reason to  end it. No light at the end of this tunnel. It's not that I want to die, it's just that every second I live is pure torture. I have to end the pain somehow. I can only think of one way."
My life ought to be good.,"Forgive my rambling.My name is Ethan. I'm a 17 year old high school senior. I'm told I'm smart and attractive. My parents are married and have money, and I live in the ""free-est"" country on earth. I'm popular at school, within the right circles. I'm the drum major of the marching band. A member of every honor society, a straight A student, and enrolled in college as a high school senior because my school ran out of classes to give me. I spend 2 hours every Monday volunteering at the local co-op, and use my position on the local city's student government to learn about and connect with people in need, and spend many, many hours at school after hours doing tutoring and mentoring. I have a relatively well-paying job, too; $10 an hour, doing vet tech work at an animal hospital.But it's not enough, and will never be enough. Not for my teachers, not for my parents, not for my friends. I am overcommitted, to say the least; it's 1:00 AM, and I've got an AP Stat test in 6 hours that I haven't studied for nearly enough. My college class overlaps the period almost entirely, so I'm only in class for the first half an hour of the 90 minute block. My school advisors and counselors told me not to take the class, and now are telling me to drop it, but my mother won't have it. My schedule is ""not rigorous enough without it"". Forget my 8-credit surplus above graduation requirements and total 13 AP credits I'll have if I make it through the year, plus the 6 extracurriculars and 4 community organizations I either lead or am an active member of-- I need the Stat class, on top of AP Gov/Macro/Micro and AP Physics C:Emag, Linear Alg & Multivar calc, all of which have at least 2 hours homework on top of required textbook reading... It's wearing me down, driving me insane. On days like today, I turn up the good vibes music and try to forget, just to put one foot in front of the other. Just to churn through what needs to happen.I'm miserable, and losing sight of what matters. My ex, my one and only real girlfriend, and I had a nasty breakup in late May. It was really rough on me, but I thought I could make it out with my head held high. I've struck out 4 times since then. They always seem so eager, and then when they really get to know me they back off. It's hard not to take it personally. Sure, maybe we two just weren't compatible, but over and over? And with people I had spent plenty of time getting to know first. It's like people are fine with the mask I wear, but when I let my guard down and start talking about my demons, they excuse themselves.And I'm not even really that fucked up, as far as demons go. Just a crippling caffeine and video game addiction; I take a 200mg caffeine pill in the morning when I wake up, with lunch, and before I sit down to do homework. But I struggle to get motivated, even with the caffeine. It's so easy to come home and sit down at the desk to work, but see the battle.net launcher or steam pop up and tempt me with Overwatch, Terraria, or Stardew, my current weaknesses. I've put an embarrassing amount of time into my games, and don't feel proud at all of my ""achievements"". The friends I used to play them with have since moved on, and I let them. It's not even just an accessibility thing; if I disable my internet, just a pen, paper, and textbook, I still end up passed out on the floor from exhaustion or staring off into space, wishing I was anywhere else.I get that feeling a lot now. Marching band was fun in the beginning; now it's a slog, and I hate it. I hate the idea of dragging my two-hundred-pound podium up to the field, running back for my gear, and despite doing my very best still being at least 15 minutes late to rehearsal. Today, I was almost 45. As drum major, I'm setting a bad example for the kids I'm supposed to lead. I tell them to practice, and then go home and leave my instrument and gloves untouched. Half of it's that I've got so much other shit to do, and the other half is that I just don't care. I don't care if I'm bad anymore. I've already resigned myself to failure no matter how hard I try. I'm just not good. My instructor has said as much many times. Staring in the mirror knowing you'll never be capable no matter how hard you try fucks you up. Especially when to practice you have to check your reflection to see if your arms are parallel. I see the apathy in my own eyes, and... well, I don't care. I'm miserable, and can't escape for very long. Even the best performances are brought down when I watch the recording and see how bad I look. Friday nights, once my escape from the weekly slog, are now just another formula. I conduct, I rest, I play, I conduct, I rest, I conduct... wash rinse repeat. And it's starting to show. People come and ask if I'm okay. I don't know what to tell them.""I'm alright."" ""I'm fine."" Relatively, I can justify this. I've felt this way for a few months now. It feels normal... and yet, I remember  feeling like this. I remember what it feels like to love myself, and love others... to feel loved. But I exacerbated the situation by isolating myself from all my friends, local and online. I haven't been on Overwatch for real in... fuck, ages. A guilty solo queue game here and there, but not much else. I stopped eating lunch with my friends, preferring to work through lunch on homework so I have less when I get home. I don't have time to hang out on weekends, because I'm either doing school, band, or working. I feel so alone, even in a room of people. I spend so much time alone. And yet, I want to be alone. When I'm with others, I'm reminded of who I'm not. I'm not the Ethan I wish I was, the Ethan I am on the outside. I've spent enough time on this sub and ; I know people will tell me that they're both parts of the whole. Bull shit. Outside Ethan is a carefully constructed lie. The sociopath brewing inside of me recognizes that I'll be socially handicapped if I present anything else, and so I've learned to smile from the eyes despite feeling empty and cold.I also lost religion a couple years ago. I was raised Catholic; my family has drifted toward the megachurch style of christianity, due to both convenience and a slight shift of ideals. Leading up to the transition, I began to question the things I was brought up to believe. When and how did all these miracles happen? Why don't we see miracles today? It seems like they just popped up all the time back then. And how come people back then heard the literal word of god and saw angels and shit, and now all we have is a cobbled-together repeatedly retranslated dusty old book? My arguments to both myself and others have become more sophisticated over time, but suffice it to say-- today I am an atheist, and nobody I've met can convince me otherwise. But I wish so hard that I was a christian. I wish it was easy, that I could give my trust to an all seeing, all caring, all powerful god. I wish I could feel the unconditional love paraded by Jesus's followers. But I can't. I've tried so hard. My personal 'faith' is unshakable, and weighs down on me constantly. I need proof, and I cannot find it anywhere. The thought that life only has the meaning we give it once gave me agency and purpose, and now it fills me with despair. Why do I matter? Why should I try? I am a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.My grades suck. Mostly because they're indicative of just how many shits I give. I have a 117 in physics. The class average is somewhere around an 75, according to my teacher. Feels kinda good, right? I also have a 56 in English, because I haven't turned in half my work. Ah well. I keep telling myself I'll get around to it when I have time, but I don't. I'm told to excel in every way, and I can't. I'm sacrificing sleep to keep this clusterfuck of a life going. I don't eat enough. I'm 6 feet tall and 135 pounds, all muscle and bone. I'm just not hungry. I want to eat, and I try, I just don't have an appetite. My hands shake constantly because I'm fueled by caffeine and caffeine alone for most of the day. My body is always tired but I force it to keep going, and I'm starting to question why.Why do I bother waking up in the morning? My body isn't getting enough sleep. My mind is cloudy from deprivation. But I know if I don't wake up by 5:40, I'll incur the wrath of my parents for not getting my little brother to school in time. I've always struggled to get to school on time, but this year it actually has consequences for someone other than me. I have school from 7 to 2, band until 6 twice a week, after school activities from 5-8 the other two days, and then I'm busy pretty much all of Friday nights. There's just not enough time in the day for it all. I'm overwhelmed, alone, and feel like while everyone in my life has the best intentions they're tearing me apart. I'm pulled in all different directions, and just want to rest. Man, I just want to take a break. I need to take some time to breath. I can't, though. The last time I did, I accumulated so much undone school work that I'm  allocating time to work on NTI's.I've got the constant weight of personal failure on my back at all times. I've failed myself, my parents, my band, my city, my friends... My parents need a good student, who spends time with the family and contributes to making sure things run smoothly. My band needs a drum major who works hard on and off the field, who comes to practice with a smile on his face and inspires his band to work with the same passion. My city needs a punctual ambassador, who doesn't forget to pick up his goddamn suit on the way home from rehearsal. My friends need someone who can be there for them like they're there for me, who makes time. I'm not that person. I need me to be that person. I need me to be someone I can love. I need me to stop smiling because I have to or my friends won't leave me alone. I need me to stop being a person who lets down and brings down.I hurt myself for the first time the other day. Just to see if I could. And I can. It's empowering. And scary. I'm more scared than ever. I now know I could do it. I'm so scared that one day a straw will break this camel's back and I'll give in to temptation. I've fantasized about it so many times. I am losing hope that there's anything worth living for. I'm starting to feel like a burden on my community, like they'd be better off without me holding them back. I know my death would hurt, but surely not so bad they'd never recover. My parents have 3 other kids that will go on to be even more successful than me. I've already distanced myself emotionally from them, and was never really close with my siblings like they are with each other. I've slowly let snapchat streaks die, and high fives in the hall become nods. Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder if I'd be like a dead cat. Mine died a few years ago; this tremendously fat white and black thing, so loving it broke my heart when he died. Every time I walked in the door and he wasn't there, I'd break into tears. Eventually I got used to sleeping alone, and the pain gradually dulled until I felt more of, ""huh. He used to sleep there. Weird not to see him like always."" I wonder if I'd be like that. That itch in the back of your mind like you feel something's missing, but you can't quite place it so you let it be. An empty seat in a classroom that might have always been empty. A position easily filled by someone just as qualified. A son already enough of a disappointment that you begin to feel grateful you don't have to yell at him to get out of bed, that he's late for school again. You have one less mouth to feed, and one less set of grades to check.I'm so scared of what's next. But I know it would stop the hurting. Even if it's nothing, it's still the bliss I want. I don't want any part of the life I'm living now. I'm like a spectator, a fly on the wall, watching it happen around me. I'm tired of the emptiness, and the pain, and the tears, and the regret. I'm tired of letting down, holding back, inconveniencing. I'm tired of letting myself down. I'm tired of failing. It's too much. And I can't give any of it up. If I do, it's not enough. It's not enough now. It will never be enough. All I can do is everything and then some. But I can't.My life ought to be good. So many stories here are much, much darker than mine. But I still don't see any hope for myself. I literally cannot imagine a future, any one at all, fantasy or otherwise, where I'm happy. I'm not motivated to keep going. I can't justify it any more. I'm miserable, and this ought to be as good as it gets. I have everything. And I have nothing. I feel nothing.I am nothing."
I am a doctor from Singapore.... I can see my lifeless corpse hanging in the public toilet,"I have been thinking of this for a while... fighting many times... staring at the stories of others who are on this forum. I can see that my end is near, and made plans for it. I am going to tell my story, so that people around will not say that i went so suddenly without a word. "
"I don't want to live anymore, the only thing keeping me alone is the thought of disappointing friends/family.","I've had a pretty decent life all in all, parents that weren't abusive or anything, I got to live in a nice place most of my life, and my family has paid for many things for me, i want to become a pilot and I've been taking flying lessons for about a year now. But recently I've not really seen much of a reason to be alive, I've gotten close to shooting myself before, but the thing that always stopped me was the thought of how selfish something like that would be. My family paid for many expensive things like lessons and other stuff, and i repay them by shooting myself? I feel like I owe them something for doing all this for me, but i don't want to be around anymore. Why can't a car just hit me, then I wouldn't be responsible for being such a Fucking failure. What can I do?"
I�۪d be just another ���Gun Control�۝ statistic,"I had the gun loaded and against my head. I kept repeating every negative thought about my life, my failures, worthlessness, and how people would be better without me. I was in a lot of emotional pain and ready to go through with it.It wasn�۪t the thought about ���there�۪s so much to live for�۝ or ���you can get through this�۝, or even thinking about loved ones, that stopped me. If was the fact that once my body was found, there would probably be a news story about another death by gun and how guns in the home are a danger.If there wasn�۪t a news story, then at least that�۪s probably what everyone would be taking about, how guns in the home are to blame and how there should be more gun control. My death would just be another stat to support a cause I didn�۪t agree with. A month later, after trying to cope with my depression and considering other options to take my own life, I told my wife what happened. She freaked out and accused me of not loving my family  (if I really loved them I wouldn�۪t have even considered it an option). She got on the phone and told EVERYONE on my side of the family and hers and then suddenly I was getting endless phone calls and texts messages about how everyone loved me. This made me feel even worse.It�۪s been a couple months since then and I�۪m still struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. It�۪s been a trial for me since I was a teenager. I�۪m in therapy now and on antidepressants but the thought is always there. The guns are no longer in my possession and I don�۪t have access to them, but I�۪ve been considering other ways to go through with suicide.I don�۪t feel like sharing any of my thoughts or struggles with my wife because of her reaction last time. And because of this, she claims that I don�۪t communicate enough. I don�۪t have any friends or family that I feel comfortable enough to confide in either. This is a struggle and a fight that I�۪m afraid I will lose.I�۪m not looking for support or suggestions, just venting my thoughts and my story. Perhaps someone else has gone through something similar."
I'm sad and tired,"I can't talk to someone, and it ends up that they have a girlfriend and they also like the same things that I like.  I wish I could be friends with them.  They like ""Mob Psycho 100"" like I do..I want to vent about something, but I'm too tired to...  Its hard to explain my family issues, too..  I wanna complain about something..  I'm too tired to, though..  It happened yesterday..Also the people that support me end up going away every time =( "
Concerned about a classmate,"Before an exam yesterday I kept hearing this girl that sits down the row from me telling her friends multiple times, very loudly she would slit her throat with her exam afterward, started describing the bloody mess that would occur. I believe she was probably joking (because of her laughter), but would it be appropriate to ask her if she's ok and give her a list of emergency and other resources she can contact? And what should I do if she says she was just joking?"
I hate myself so much,"I feel guilty for existing and it's eating away at me and I can't take it anymore. Even just talking to people makes me feel guilty because why should I expect anyone to want to talk to me. I wouldn't want to talk to myself I'm such a worthless disgusting piece of shit I have nothing to contribute. Why should I expect anyone to waste any of their energy on me.I'm pretty sure I was never meant to be born. Everyone would be better off if I wasn't but now if i kill myself I'll just cause people pain and inconvenience. My life is just a running joke and I know I'm viewed as incompetent and practically worthless by everyone else but they would never admit it. I'm the butt to every joke and I'm just ""some monkey that follows people around.""People tell me to talk about my problems but if I do I'm just throwing myself a pity party because I don't have any real issues. And if I don't it's my fault I'm depressed because I'm not getting myself help even though deep down I know I don't deserve help. Honestly before I wasn't sure if I wanted to die. But now I'm one hundred percent sure that this is exactly what I deserve and this is what everyone wants. I am absolutely disgusted by myself and I claw at my skin because I just want to escape so bad I can't keep living in my body anymore it's too much pain having to go to class and interact with people who I know think so poorly of me. "
(vent)I tried calling the hotline. they made me feel worse.,"posting this before I head to bed. figured someone should know. before anything happens, I don't feel suicidal anymore at the moment.to cut things short because i'm tired, my mom came and yelled at me again, because my parents were complaining about me still having no job. I felt like shit, and began thinking about suicide again because of my depression. Tried talking to a friend, didn't help, got into a fight with her, and she ends up ""making"" me call the suicide hotline. and by making, I mean I told her I would call her to prove my point that calling them would have been a waste of time for me, because it wouldn't change my situation. I called, talked for a bit, and ended up pissed off at the person I was talking to because they basically re enforced everything I already knew. things like I have to be the one to make the change,a I have to look for what I want in life. and like every other person who tells me that, they don't really get how some things are just out of my control. Just because I want something to change doesn't mean it'll happen. hung up on them, told my friend about it, and made her feel worse, which made me feel even worse about myself. another reason to add to the list of why I suck as a person."
"If i wake up tomorrow I'm going to be very, very disappointed","I'm a student, currently failing despite my best efforts. Stayed home today for the first time because I couldn't muster the will to get out of bed. I feel so queasy and sick, suicidal, dying. It hurts so goddamn bad.
I want to die. I hate myself, every part of myself. I'm not worth any of this, not any of what I do or could have.
I hate myself. I'm crying. I haven't cried in years. I hate myself. I'm a failure in everything that counts, and I'm not worth loving.
It hurts. It hurts. I just want to die."
Why'd they have to take her away from me?,"I�۪m heartbroken, wretched and inconsolable. I�۪m frustrated. I�۪m incandescent. I�۪m furious. I never hated but now I hate you all. I hate the whole of humanity. I want to burn you all in a pire made of your own bones. I want to drown you all in a river made of your own tears. Just like you burned her lifeless body after drowning her in that sinful river that is so sacred to you. Your gods forbid you from taking the lives of cows but wants the life of a girl taken just because she loved another girl. Fuck you!She was beautiful; she was kind; she was the purest thing I�۪d ever seen in my life and now she�۪s gone. God, we only kissed. We didn�۪t hurt or hate. We only held hands and wanted to sleep in each others�۪ arms. We only needed to be happy. We only needed to live. How inhumane and ignorant do you have to be to kill her in the name of a nonexistent god? Religions are suppossed to make you better beings not savages. Apparently, that�۪s what you are; ruthless, clueless savages. May your heavens be filled with ever raging fires of malbolge. Fuck gods and fuck you ignorant bipeds for following them.I remember us laughing about this happening. It was such a silly matter to us. I said I�۪d give my life for hers if it ever comes to that. But I didn�۪t. I couldn�۪t. I was locked up in that cage we call a house and was too much of a pussy to save the love of my life from dying. No, not dying. Being ruthlessly murdered. I was spared because I was the daughter of the rich bastard who had power over people and she was killed because she was the daughter of a poor worker. If only my father was as powerless as hers was.I remember her telling me that no matter what happens she still believed in the goodness of people. That it�۪s your lack of understanding that causes fear and that you would never be stupid enough to take someone�۪s life for just loving another person. That girl believed in humanity so much that I want to eat all your hearts alive for what you did to her.What�۪s even more frustrating is the fucking police. I called them, I cried to them, I wept before them and all they did was standing there while that innocent girl was drowned. The law was deaf to the screams of a lover and blind to the lawlessness of gods and their followers. A blind law for a blind following; it�۪s only fitting. There isn�۪t much you can do about justice when the law is lawless except make your own. And that I will.Not all of you combined would make one of her. No amount of filthy violence you have to offer would compare to a grain of innocence she had. You�۪re scum and your gods are even worse for they are the creations of your collective minds of sin. Even when she was being taken away she told me that it�۪s going to be okay; that god will save us; which they clearly didn�۪t. Instead, they called her a demon, a monster. A monster that�۪d come to destroy me.
Well, you�۪ve made a monster now.Once I�۪ve published this, I�۪d be preparing for one final ritual. For what you�۪ve done, and what you haven�۪t, you will pay the price. And I will too, for my weakness; and so will the gods whom you�۪re so devoted. I�۪m in pain, and it will end soon for I will be with her, sleeping homely in her arms.fFarewell,
V."
I can't do this anymore...,"I can't maintain any form relationship. Even when I hangout with people, I feel so distant and isolated from them. I constantly think about suicide and my motivation to carry on is gone. I wake up and cry I'm not sure if I will attempt my 4th attempt this week or not. I just can't live like a ghost anymore. "
I feel like I'm waiting around to die.,"I went to the hospital Friday and honestly, I feel so much worse.  I'm kind of a problem drinker and I was feeling stressed because I'm the VP of a political club and all the men in the organization passionately hate me. They've circulated that I have bipolar because they found an article where I spoke out about it. I've felt absolutely terrible because of them.
Yesterday we meeting with the CEO of our party and they were so rude to both of us. Then I felt anxious so I started drinking more. Apparently, I met Senator Al Franken blackout drunk and told him I was a ""real Patrick Kennedy"" and he chuckled.
I then proceeded to get trashed until I was lying in the street screaming about killing myself. I was with my friend and a passerby called the police. The EMT came and took me to the emergency room. They left my phone and my shoes (flats... IDK why they took them off?) with my friend who they didn't allow to come.
I was so beyond freaked out and scared, but basically, I just sat around for six hours hyperventilating and panicking until they released me for whatever reason. I was honestly really surprised they released me. I think I kept panicking about a fundraiser I had to go to today so maybe they knew I wasn't an immediate threat? I was just really surprised because I literally had cuts on my arm from me trying to harm myself with a knife.  I always knew this would happen, but I thought when it did I would at least be given resources? I'm unmedicated, uninsured, and I do not qualify for Medicaid. I cannot afford insurance and honestly, I know that I am going to die. It's horrifying.
The discharge papers told me to go to AA and read a CBT workbook. I've never felt worse in my life. I'm now over a thousand dollars in debt (luckily it's just over a thousand because they asked me if I rode in an ambulance and I lied?) and I wasn't treated for anything.
I also had to walk three miles barefoot through the city at 5 AM back to my apartment because I didn't have contacts to pick me up.  I'm more scared and alone than I've ever been in my entire life. My condition is unfair to my friends and they're absolutely sick of me. I'm more suicidal than I've ever been and I feel like I'm just waiting to die. I don't even want to die. I want help, but it isn't out there. I think life isn't meant for me."
It took me 10 minutes to get back here,"10 minutes ago I was okay, for a week. It was because of my brother's wedding. And in only 10 minutes I got fucking suicidal again. Dropped so deep again. I'm not planning to do it tonight but this could change in the next 10 minutes and I could be on my way in only 20 minutes...
The biggest problem is that there is no wedding or other event in sight. So I won't come out of this soon. And I was never as deep as I was before the wedding. And I'm really close to this again. To be honest I'm pretty sure I'll end up doing it this week. Maybe today."
"25M. Haven't talked to anyone in almost a year, lost girlfriend, lost religious beliefs, dropped out of college 2 years ago (I think, last years have been a loop), jobless, penniless (150��� in my name), grew up and live with abusive family. Can't delude myself into prolonging this anymore","There is so much I'm not writing out of shame. It would also be impossibly long. I've been writing this for 3 hours now because somehow I know this might be one of the last things I write. Well I don't know anything anymore. The only thing that makes me go on to see another day is the faith of stumbling on an opportunity that could make me go work or do anything far away from here and have a fresh start.Aside from this contrived scenario there is only so many times I could soldier on and give it . I'm a sad thing to look at now for few years now. I'm in a comically impossible situation that I can't get out of. I shouldn't have forfeited my life into my parents hands. I was always predisposed and taught to live my life with them as the center of it, and slowly but surely I sabotaged my life to fulfill my roll has an extension of their miserable existence. It saddens me because I know I had the predisposition for doing something great with my life if only I had grown up with a normal household. After all I felt pretty close to it and I grew up with narcissistic, vile people. And they were at home all day, every day, with a steady  since they were doing something pretty much illegal. They used that time to treat everyone in their vicinity like trash, including each other. Social services would have taken me away if only they knew what went on over the years. But I grew up in a don't ask don't tell environment. Well... it is what it is. And what's done is done.  One thing is certain, the act of living in my shoes is worse than the nothingness of dying. I can't trick myself into enduring misery any longer, nor would it be an act of love. Ending this would sort of be the biggest show of love I could do to myself, actually.  Fuck, I even feel ashamed for having written a post on suicide watch when I'm feeling suicidal. I can't even do a suicide watch thread properly "
A suicide attempt feels inevitable.,"I just started a new job and its really stressful its alot to learn and i dont know if i can do it, im only doing it cause my roomates want me to take this job and its the only one available. Ive also been informed that they dont really care for me or at least my struggles, im only good to anyone when im happy. My relationship isnt going well, i have ptsd and major depression and i cant ever change to be what he wants. we both agree we dont feel like this going well. i dont have family to go to im just trapped here, i keep thinking im going to have to kill myself, there is no other choice i have no where else to go and the only people around me have made it clear they dont care that im struggling, they call me crazy. This would be my second attempt, i dont want to but there is nothing else for me to do."
Afraid I'm a real pedo...,"At first I thought it was just POCD because I have OCD too, even my therapist said so but now I'm not so sure anymore. I have done some age play - role play stuff online and I'm afraid I like it. I'm scared I like the idea of having sex with little kids.I don't want to be like this, I don't want to harm kids. I'm thinking about taking some pills or something to see if I have less sex drive. I can't deal with this anymore, I'm really depressed and I can't function right anymore because of this.There are so many fucked people out there, and I don't want to be one of them. I'm alone with all this and I can't tell anyone about it, it sucks. It sucks living with this inside me knowing that no one in the world can help me.I could tell my therapist but what could she ever do for me? Nothing... It sucks, but if it's true it's really scary since there is no cure or anything. It's just the way I am and it's terrible. :("
i decide to live for maybe one more year,i realize life is precious and that even though nobody care about me and only call me autism and fucking stupid little fuck that i should still live no marrer wat problems i have even if they make me want to go mad and cause a cataclyms.
Method used in Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington's suicides,"I know this is kind of morbid, but given that crime scene photos have leaked and that both were exceptionally interesting and beautiful human beings, has anyone explained exactly how Chester and/or Chris committed their acts of suicide?I know both of them hung themselves with simple household items. In Chris' case, he used workout resistance bands. In Chester's case, he used a belt. In both cases, it seems as though there was no significant drop and they therefore died via strangulation (cutting off blood) or choking (cutting off air), not via neck injury.I've always been under the impression that it was fairly difficult to make a reliable noose using these types of items, in part bc of the high suicide failure rate, particular among women, and in part bc I've never researched or thought about it too deeply. However, the fact that both Chris and Chester succeeded makes me think that creating a reliable device is easier than I realized and that many failed suicide attempts are not actual suicide attempts, but rather deliberate failures as a cry for help. I totally sympathize with both those who actually commit suicide and those who ""attempt"" suicide as a cry for help. I've desired the courage to carry out both types of acts in the past and can see how one may do such a thing. My heart goes out to anyone in that mental place.But back to the question, anyone on here (or elsewhere on the internet) broken down exactly how Chris and/or Chester carried out their respective acts? I have a morbid curiosity about these types of things for some reason."
My best friend is planning on killing himself by the end of this week.,"One of my closest friends is planning to kill himself by the end of this week. His father is an abusive alcoholic, and he gets bullied at school. I'm the only one who knows this. We're both 15. He's almost killed himself twice before, both times I've talked him out of it. But this time it seems he has his heart set on it, and I don't know what to do. He's the one sincere friend I have, one that understands what it's like to suffer from depression like I do, one that understands what it's like to have an abusive parent like I did.Problem is, he lives a whole country away from me. And there's so much I can do to help, and I just feel so, so helpless. I don't want to lose him at all, Reddit, I really don't. He thinks of himself as useless, a burden, a waste of space. When in reality, he's worth so, so much. He's kind, he's patient, heck he'll even tolerate things he doesn't enjoy to ensure the happiness of his friends. He means the world to me. He's so used to people hating him that sometimes he doesn't believe I don't find him annoying, that I'm lying when I say that he's one of my closest friends. He gets shocked when I tell him that I don't find him to be burdensome at all. I don't know how much more I can do to help, any advice would be appreciated, please. He's the best thing to happen to me in my awful life."
I think i need help,"In my current situation i have no friends, im shy and have anxiety im too scared to talk to anyone in real life including therapist, I'll never be in a relationship because im ugly and i planned out my entire suicide. Im 19 and I've planned my suicide before with no ACTUAL thoughts of really doing it but im so fucking serious now and im scared but i know im gonna do it i just think i need any help before i realize im stupid for speaking up and delete this post."
I have accepted that I will kill myself. I think I am now approaching that point,"I came to this belief last week. I was at my therapist and I said it out loud. I told him that I likely would not do it soon, but that my long term mental health suggested that would be the way I'd go.That seems like a shitty thing to do to someone who is trying to help.We agreed to break our arrangement. He said he would follow up with references to a psychiatrist and a life coach. Having had plenty of experience with illegal drugs, and limited experience with prescription drugs, I doubted that a scrip would help. All the same, he could forward me the references.He hasn't, yet. I am not exactly enamored with his professionalism... but people can improve. He is the last of 5 therapists that I've seen through my 20s.I admitted to him in a prior session that I was a cocaine and sex addict. Until a month ago, I partied a lot. I wouldn't even call it partying. I would get home by 3 am, and stay gakked up till 8. I would sometimes call over an escort. The funny thing is that I wouldn't even have sex with them. Partially because coke leaves you unable to perform. But I just needed to hold someone, and feel another human body next to mine. I read that close human contact can stimulate the release of feel-good chemistry for the brain. I've always been about that feel-good chemistry.I have used drugs on and off for almost a decade. I'm sure that this time of substance abuse has contributed to the mess of neural tissue in my head.I (think I) have these episodes of self destructiveness to counterbalance what I think of as the rigid discipline of my daily life. Wake up at 5. Get to the gym by 545. Exercise and shower. Start work 815. Lunch 1130-1230. Continue till 8pm. Home by 830. Jerk off, read, etc, 930. Sleep. Repeat. The Appollo to my Dionysius.I hate my work. I am the youngest and least experienced person here. I am asked to lead projects and know more than the salts I work with. I am held accountable for collective failures while everyone I work with can claim it is not part of their narrow responsibilities. I am a highly paid professional scapegoat who charmed his way into a job that he is grossly underqualified for, and is now paying the price for a lack of work ethic. I make money that goes into a savings account. I can eat, and drive, and live without discomfort. I really don't need more.I left my last job because I felt I lacked purpose. I moved across the country. I realize now that I was trying to run from myself. Now an opportunity to go somewhere else has appeared... Good luck with that.I am close to family, here in my new city. My parents, my brother. Niece and nephew. I haven't lived with them in a decade. These people love me but they don't know the person that I am. I can't talk to them about this, because I have before, and it made things worse.When the coroner calls my parents, will my dad have that heart attack? Will my mom have a stroke? Will I destroy my family? I know the answer to these questions. It's unbearable that the only thing to free me from this world will wreak such havoc.I am unlovable. I can't be in a relationship with someone. I am mercurial. I am physically insecure. I am prone to letting my Dionysian take control and lose control. That's why the last three left. I am past the point in life where I can madly fall in love with someone. And yet, some tiny, simian impulse keeps telling me that finding someone to lie down with, to hold, to laugh with, finding someone who understands me and cares for me, someone who will be kind to me, will fix me. Hey, ladies - one 100% basket case, all for the taking. Please, get in line.There are many ways to do it. Suicide by cop, step in front of a train, call my dealer and ask him for fentanyl. But I don't want to implicate someone in my death. I don't want a stranger to bear the burden of my death. There are 5 storey parking garages all around me. That will probably be how it happens.I'm not going to kill myself tonight. I am frankly too fatigued to make an attempt. But I'm closer than I have ever been in my life. I'm not at the end of the road, but I can see it from here.My life is dull, lacking in spark. I see no reason to keep going. I don't know what to do, or what will help. I want an answer to fall out of the sky. I hope that it does for all of you."
I'm going for a walk,"And I want to be hit by a car or mugged so I can die and make it look like an accident. That way my family won't feel ashamed that their only son committed suicide, it'll be considered a tragedy. Realistically, I'm going to probably going to have to walk across a red light, on a certain street that I know always has trucks going across it. I guess you can consider this my last note. I guess I should give more information about myself. You can call me E. I'm 18 and from the United States, but currently living in Germany. What am I doing in Germany? I left everything behind, my parents, my ""freinds"" (I'll touch on that later) followed the only person that I loved, a girl who was a foreign exchange student at my school last year, I had worked so hard to find a school where I could study in english and still be in the same city as her. Yeah well you can guess how that worked out. She knew I was coming across the world, I had paid for my college, rented an apartment, and was 100% committed to her. And she still fucking left. Just like everyone else. And guess what. She replaced me with somebody who looks almost exactly like me. A FUCKING DOPPELGANGER. I've gotten messages from people asking if it was me. Yeah no it fucking isn't. Anyways, I'm in Germany now, and I don't speak a word of German. I've gone through my schools international department for everything, but I have nothing done yet. I don't have health insurance, I don't even have a full student visa, only my 90 day entrance visa and that's running out soon. But that's the least of my worries. I'm sure I sound whiny. Go ahead and criticize me if you want, you can't say anything worse about me than I've already thought about myself. Anyways, after all the fucked up shit she did, I still love her. But that's not the only reason I envision death. Not only have I lost her, I've lost all my close friends that I've known for years. People I grew up with. People who watched me grow up. Just gone. Why? I'll give you some examples of the last conversation I had with some. I asked ""Hey, I'm feeling down again today, I don't really know what to do, can you help?"" Their reply was ""Ask someone else, I really don't want to hear it anymore"". Even today, I asked another ""Hey man, can you talk?"" and got the response ""Can I? Yeah I can. Do I want to deal with you? No E, I don't"" followed by them blocking me. So now I have nobody. But wait, if anyone is still reading this, I have another worry! I'm out of money! As in, I have maybe 20 cents left. My rent's due next week and I have no idea how I'm going to afford it. So I'll be homeless if I continue living. Adding to that, I haven't eaten anything since sunday afternoon, and I'm honestly ready for death. And if you're reading this, you know who you are, I want to say I'm sorry. You'll probably be the first to find out, since you're still the emergency contact at school, in my passport and for my apartment. You were simultaneously the best and worst thing that had ever happened to me. There's a note for you in my desk drawer, next to every note you had written me, and every picture we took together. I know you've forgotten me but I haven't forgotten you. I hope you're happy, and you get to live out all the dreams we had shared. I hope you get the Tesla we would always design. I hope you get the barn and the horse you wanted. I love you. I'm sorry. If anyone else reads this much, I'm sorry you read this, I'm a lost cause. I've decided. Goodbye."
I feel numb,"I guess my story starts when I was about 12 years old. I started to self harm and knew I didn't want to be alive anymore. As I continued to grow up I promised myself I would never let myself live in pain the way I was for the rest of my shitty life.The depression comes and goes, but it always finds a way back to me. You know when you love someone, and you don't know how you can survive without them? My depression treats me like that, an abusive relationship that gets better and then hits full in dragging me down further each time.I can find a little bit of happiness and a little bit of meaning to my life. I can start to feel good and realize I'm really not that great of a person. I'm awful, and yes I would leave people behind, but to be honest they are far better off. I think constantly about  how I could end my pathetic pointless life. I can't get a gun, but I'm also not down for just slicing my arms open in a bathtub (Rules of Attraction). I guess what lauched me the hardest this time is the fact that anytime I feel for someone I get hurt. I fall in love and start to feel normal, and it just ends. I haven't felt for someone in years, and I've known this person since we were children.I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. What I could fix to make me more likable, attractive, funny. I wish I knew what was wrong with me where no one can love me back.I made a plan a while ago to end my life on October 13th, and it made sense to me. It felt right, and this asshole comes in and makes me feel like there might be hope,  and reminds me I'm shit.I can't kill myself on the next Friday the 13th in april because a family members birthday  is too close to that date and that person means too much to hurt them like that. I have this October or almost a year to decide if I want this life anymore. The thing is I've given my life so many chances and I've tried to change my life and it's still awful. I'm still alone and yeah I have a few people that give a fuck about me, but I'll never get married or have friends that relate to me."
Mimd is racing a mile a minute and every train of thought end with suicide,"My boyfriend and I got into a ridiculous argument and it blew way out of proportion. He says it's over between us and I can't deal with the loss. My thoughts are going wild and I can't stop imagining suicide as this wonderful problem solver. Although I'm too afraid to try it again, I so tempted to cut myself. I'm battling it out in my mind trying to convince myself that it's not a good idea but I want to do it so badly. Any tips to stop or redirect these thoughts? I have to be up for work in about 4 1/2 hours and I really want at least some sleep tonight..."
I am slowly progressing towards it. Im gonna do it.,I will turn 30 this year. I did my B.Tech in 2009 and since then have done various certifications and jobs. I have experience of 4 big companies where I barely learned much. Most of it is theoretical.I was fed up of IT technical domain as new apps and tools keep coming every year and I barely got hands on experience in them. I did my certification in ITIL then PRINCE2. But I was not getting any exposure in those domains.On 1st September I left my job at IBM as I was fed up. They werent giving me anything exciting and I was working from home. Since then I have been applying for various jobs but no results.One or two calls that I got ... unfortunately the HRs said the position is filled (after getting calls from them and reaching their office) and the next one I got rejected. Sitting at home I am not in flow with what all I did at work.I want to work in a stress free environment preferably management or PMO role. But when I apply (even though I have certifications) I get no response.I am fed up of running around. My mind seems foggy. I tried cutting my wrists but it wasnt working. I need to die. I have no one in my life to help me. I tried suicide 4 other times in my life. I have nothing to live for. Im a loser at 30 who cant even get a job.
Feeling like everyone would be happier without me,"Long story short, my girlfriend of the last 3 years just up and randomly left me without so much as a reason (which is okay, that's just life; doesn't really matter because it still hurts), but what really hit hard was her saying ""yes"" when I asked her if she'd be happier if I was dead. That really made me think: my parents would be better off if I was gone, my brother, my peers (current HS senior, 18), my coworkers, everyone would be better off if I was gone. The way I see it, we all die anyway and what difference does 60-70 years make in the grand scheme of things? The girl I thought I'd spend my life with hates me, I'm probably not going to graduate, and my plans to join the military probably just aren't going to work out; I have no future and no hope. I guess the only reasons I can think of why I haven't done anything yet is because I don't want pain, I'm scared shitless of the thought of not existing (as comforting as it is), and I worry about my dog and cat wondering what happened to me. The only reason I'm posting here is that I always told my ex to wait a few days before going through with suicide (if you're gonna be dead forever, what difference  does a few days make) when was going through depression, and I figured I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't follow my own advice. If you read through all of this, I sincerely thank you; all of you that volunteer your time to read and reply here and good people."
"Date is set, mind is made","I've had enough of all this negativity that has infected me for as long as I remember. I can't take this anymore. I've hurt too many people close to me due to my mental instabilities. For years I put people through torment, through anguish, through pain. These are actual words and quotes. I get it, I'll never change. I've been a broken person since I was born. I'm selfish. I have trouble showing feelings. I can't give back for what has been given to me. I'm nothing. I just can't continue on with who I am. I completely lost all care in the world -- I am in so much crippling debt, I have an addiction to alcohol now, and facing a legal situation I don't want to care about anymore, or any of it for the matter, because I am planning to die, which is my greatest urge. It's all I think about now. Date has been set for Oct. 9. I really want to be in a place where nothing matters anymore. I'm done....I saw what I needed to see. This world is just not something I want to be in anymore. "
I feel nothing...,"I wouldn't say my intentions are not to kill myself, no that is not the case at all. I feel the emptiness and yes my mind ponders to the very darkest corners of my thoughts. I don't know exactly what is setting it off. 4 weeks ago I left my long term relationship and did not feel heart broken, in fact I felt nothing. I slept with an ex best friend, felt nothing, slept with my friends brother, felt nothing. Stopped going to my university classes and guess what? I am not stressed or anything I just feel like I float. I feel like I lost myself and I have been hurt for so long and so badly hurt that I just don't feel it anymore. I ended up self harming, something 14 year old me would do not 19 year old me. I just don't have anyone to tell this to or get the help that I need because I don't know where to go really."
"Help me, please","I'm keeping this short and sweet; I'm a 19f that has aspergers sydrome, and I've got awful anxiety. It stops me from doing so much, and I can't even think of the future because if it. I've been depressed and suicidal in the past and I thought it was over me, but now it's returned. My anxiety is so bad I can't see a way to live. I can't even cook a fucking egg it's that bad, and my social life? No fucking existence. My friends don't even acknowledge me outside of school. I've been battling with suicidal thoughts this past month, but I love my family too much to carry it out. But now it's 1 in the morning, I looked at all of my pills and I just googled how long it takes to die from an overdose. I'm actually considering this, and it fucking terrifies me. I can't stop crying, and I need help, but years of therapy hasn't helped, so how could it now? I can't run away to a relative's house like I used to because my sister has a formal tomorrow and I don't want to ruin her day by being like 'Surprise! I wanna hang myself again!' What the fuck do I do? I'm so stuck and I'm so afraid and fed up. I just... I can't deal with all this anymore.. Please, any advice is greatly appreciated "
"Months before procedure that will make life more bearable, doctors are fucking me over","My medications are being changed to fulfill a blanket, one-size-fits-all policy and I'm fucking miserable. Every day is just crawling by. I can't live like this but there's nothing I can do. If I challenge them they'll just deny me access to the procedure I need. If I switch doctors, there goes my authorization. I'm fucked and they know it. It's cheaper for them if I just die."
Not sure how to do this,"My wife and I split I became very suicidal a month later she came back tells me she was with 3 different people and was off about everything seemed she did love me but she also was lost in her own mind. 3 weeks later she goes and gets a tatoo from a friend I let her go didn't think much of it. She gets home she cries alot tells me she doesn't deserve me  asking me what would completely end are marriage she did this for another week intill we are in the car she says that she loves me more then she has ever loved me and confesses that she slept with the person that gave her a tattoo and was balling hard for hours begging me to stay to talk to her (I didn't say a word or show that I wanted her in my life for hours) finally I say somthing and I don't much remember what I said but it wasn't nice and I wanted to stay at my dad's for awhile she begged me for hours intill I said I wouldn't go. She  cried and cried more for a long time begging me not to leave her and that she felt she fucked up and destroyed the only thing in her life that was worth somthing and begged me not to leave her(I had a very very hard time staying and not leaving) But as the day past I grabbed her hand and she held it as hard as she ever has and still does to this day (this happened 2 months ago and we still are going strong) now she cares about me more then ever always want to be by my side and she has turned back into the wife I remember that would do anything and everything for me and shows it.
Anyways I still want to die I still don't want to live anymore Idk what to do becuz i would never leave her becuz I fear if i did I would kill myself and I know I would i do love her to death but I still want to leave but not leave her while I'm alive I just want to die and I want to tell her that I'm suicidal still but I don't want to hurt her even if she fucked me over and hurt me I'm the type of person that would never hurt anyone and would never do anything to make someone cry so I keep myself alive only for the reason that I won't hurt someone and I don't know how long that will keep up Idk what to do becuz i want to talk to her about me but I feel I can't becuz of that I need advice"
I'm afraid.,"I feel like killing myself. I'm terrified of death though, and the pain. But I would do anything to escape this feeling I get, like its already over. I'm tired. I think all I need is one more thing, one more push to send me over the edge. To make the fear of death less frightening than living with myself for one more second. I've been trying as best I can to get better, with therapy and medication, but nothing is helping. It feels hopeless, I feel worthless. I feel too much, and too little. I don't know if i'm making any sense."
Paranoia over past events making me suicidal,"I�۪ve been recently feeling extremely paranoid over some past events whose details I�۪ve shared with a few people in my life, and I am afraid of those details leaking to the wrong people and it ruining my relationships.That�۪s about as specific as I can get with regards to the paranoia; needless to say, it�۪s causing me to feel suicidal, I feel as if is inevitable that the details of my past mistakes will be relayed to the wrong people and ruin my life.The ���what if�۪s�۝ are consuming me, and my brain is playing tricks on me, making me think that the worst case scenario is about to take place.I cannot find a moment�۪s peace, and my partner doesn�۪t want to deal with it.I have no idea who to turn to or what to do. As a point of reference, I am located in the state of Texas."
I'm scared,I've written my letters. Put them in envelopes for the people I think I cared for. I think I'm ready. I keep telling myself I'm okay with this. I'm ready. But I've been staring at this noose for hours now. I've felt its grip on my neck. I'm scared. I'm so scared. But I can't keep fighting anymore. I don't have any fight in me. I can't get up anymore. And I'm scared.
Dealing with MDD for 17yrs. Wife cheated. I see no way to recover and want to end it,"So this may be a bit lengthy. Apologies.I'm a 34 year old male. Growing up I was abused by my family, emotionally, physically, and sexually. I have been dealing with/diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (both which are largely unresponsive to treatment) since I was about 13 or 14 years old.  It Manifests in devastating, physical shut downs where I go catatonic for hours and can't even speak, or days where I lay in bed shaking with anxiety.
   I have a 153 IQ, and am a polymath with nearly perfect recall - traits I have never been able to take advantage of or use to their full potential. I dropped out of high school (too much stress and needed to heal), moved onto college years later and dropped out as well (perfect grades but relapsed and have never been able to get to where I need to be emotionally to go back).
   At this point in my life I have spent more time living with this disease than with out. I have tried 7 different Rx drugs, been involved in several clinical trials for what would otherwise be illegal drugs (Ketamine, LSD, MDMT, etc), and have seen a veritable small army of psychiatrists and therapists, and have been hospitalized in psych wards several times as a danger to myself.
   My wife and I met in 2011. She has her own sets of issues, including emotional abuse from her family and sexual abuse from abusive SOs and one truly horrifying incident where she was gang raped in an alley. All of which results in her own set of anxiety and depression.We are of a pair, she and I.She had already owned a house and within the 1st year I moved in. In 2012, we lost the house in Hurricane Sandy, in a fire that killed several pets and near took us as well. The word ""devastated"" would be too weak, too narrow, too lacking in depth to describe her state for most of that year. However to my surprise and pride, I was able to remain strong. I carried her through that year. I took care of rebuilding our house and our lives until she eventually recovered enough to join me.
   However our, intimate life suffered greatly because of that trauma and has never recovered. To all intents and purposes, ours is now and has been for years, a sexless marriage - and not for lack of interest, support, love or caring on my side.
   In January 2017 I discovered she had been committing emotional infidelities to the point of planning weekend get-away trysts in motels with the men she enticed online. This was my turn at devastation and anger, and I said somethings I'd like to take back, things that still hurt her today. Within 8 hours I had admitted myself to the local psych ward as I knew I would need to be watched. When I was released, she swore these online communications were just to try to get some one to commit to a get-away, not to follow through, that she just needed to feel some sort of control, to be in control like that as she had felt her life was spiraling out of control. So promised she would never do it again and we tried to heal.
   However, the healing never happened. I tried to reach out to hear continually to engage her, to spend time with her, to be intimate (not necessarily sexual). At most what I occasionally received was half-hearted tries that were far and few-between. In May of 2017 I discovered that in the last December (2016) and through to a month after I was released from the hospital, she had been having an affair with a co-worker. Obviously I was pissed. I was incensed. But against expectations I was able to stay functional, even as I fell apart inside. That night she was so ashamed of what she'd done, I comforted HER as she confessed. and I listened to her beg me to stay for days as I dealt with my inner turmoil.
   Again I saw she was clearly regretful and in pain for what she had done. She said this time she had been convinced I would leave and she felt that realization change something in her and she was re-committed to ""us"". And I experienced a weird dichotomous and what's known as ""Hysterical Bonding"" where although I felt anger, even hate and disgust toward her, all I wanted was to love her and be loved by her in the physical, intimate sense. (I actually had to research this as I'd never experienced it nor heard of it before).
   It is now September 2017 and while I believe she has ceased her infidelities (although who can say for sure at this point). The problem remains: if her flirting in text and otherwise, her actual effort put into a physical sexual affair, is compared to what effort she has given to me this year, then she still has given more effort and more time to her lover than to me. Even if you take the last 2 years, that lover has still had more of her time and efforts in the bedroom than I have.
   I cannot describe to you what 9 months of constant perseveration feels like. Constantly berating myself with thoughts like, ""She clearly finds him more attractive"", ""He's clearly more of a man than I am."", ""She clearly sees him as a better father for her son [me step-son]"". It is so bad that I have a hard time NOT seeing another man's genitals in her mouth whenever I look at her. I cannot feel her touch with out acute anxiety and pain. I cannot feel her touch with being reminded. I AM IN CONSTANT PAIN. Constant anxiety, expressing itself in constant stomach cramps and gastro-intestinal distress.
   And there's so much more! I have to fight to get her to spend time with me, time she gladly moves heaven and earth to make for literally everyone else but me. I offer her nothing but love and kindness in so many ways. If she has to work late, I stay up late to make sure she has a hot meal and some tea when she comes home - I pamper the fuck out of her!
   And every month like clockwork we have these arguments where I just scream all of this at her and she takes it all and agrees that she's treating me badly, tells me how much she loves me and promises to do better but nothing ever changes.I want to leave! I know I should have ages ago. I tried!But there is nothing left of me. No self-esteem, no confidence in my self, no confidance as a man or as an adult, no confidence as a lover. I have nothing in me. nothing to support me. I have no tools to heal from this and I am so very very very tired. I have literally had to put the pieces of my life back together several times in my lifetime, and it is exhausting. I don't have the strength to do this again. I'm not even sure if I want to.And in all these years of struggle all these close calls at ending it. Meticulous plans and preparations to end my life that come within a hair's breadth of being taken, I have never written a note to my family. Tonight I wrote a note to my family. I am SO scared. I am SO miserable. And I am in SO much pain. And I am SO SO lonely. I have literally suffered torture these last 9 months I. Am. Done."
I can't take it anymore. This is what I was meant to do. At least no one will remember me anyway.,"Backstory, if anyone cares: I was sexually assaulted a year ago, I live with an abusive family, and these things contribute to me wanting to die.Okay, now on to the part where I bitch about wanting to die for the billionth time.I have no future, I have no one who cares about me, I have nothing good to contribute to the world, and I'm stupid. I just make everyone feel worse. I try too hard to be funny, even though I know I'm not. I constantly attention whore and make it harder for other people to do whatever they want to do. I humblebrag and I'm an asshole, et cetera, existence is pain. If it matters, I just started sertraline for my dysmorphia and it's given me the energy to try to hang myself. It obviously didn't work, but hey, at least I tied the belt around my neck this time. Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm bothering to post here. I'm fairly sure I'll try again in a few hours. Thank you all for taking the time to read. "
Feel like my life is pointless.,"Recently I've been feeling like I'm useless for many reasons,
I am a 18 Year old currently in the uk and I've made many wrong choices in the world for example gone down the wrong side career path which is now too long late to change, which I am not going to get anywhere in.
Feel as so I will never get a job that keeps me with a roof over my head, food and things that I wish to have.
I am over weight and find it really hard to lose weight, I've been trying for over 5 years.
I've got no friends.
No one ever speaks to me, only with small talk or one word.
I get ignored by lots of people.
When walking passed people around college, even people who I never met before, they all say nasty things or take the mick, which I don't know why because I have done anything.
Even one of my tutors wasn't really friendly whom I had last year as she always picked on me and never believed what I said.
I've never had a girlfriend, I've felt like I have fallen in love once before when I was 15 and i thought she felt the same about me due to the way she acted and spoke, when I told her how I felt about her she never spoke to me again and got a group of people who threaten me as it turned out she was just using me.
However this last year I have found someone new, which I have feelings like I've never felt before but she seems to good for me as I'm scared to tell her how I feel because of what happened last time and I know she will reject me as I'm not perfect at all but I also feel as if I find someone I truly like it will change my life completely.
Im completely unattractive
My anxiety makes everything worse what I do.
I am a very shy person.
My life goes down hill each and everyday, things becoming more worse for me then ever
People look down at me as if I'm _�թ
They are many other reasons wh�� I'm feeling down.
I know some of you will probably laugh at me because I'm pathetic, but this is how I feel but I'm scared of dying.
The only people who seem to care about me is probably my family."
i give up,"title. i've been through a sexually abusive past, lived through an alchoholic mother who was never there for me, and currently live with a dad who is nothing but extremely negative. i can't be intimate with anybody, I've got nobody. life feels like an endless swirl of guilt and helplessness. even my therapist has given up on me. i've ran out of distractions. i've played a video game enough to be on the best team in NA yet it's meaningless. played music enough to last weeks, but it's lost meaning. called a hotline only to have police at my door step, waiting to take me to a hospital. going to college to earn a degree that I don't know what. I'm wasting my life away, and I'm only 20. i've been wrestling with that question I'm sure everyone else has; why do i wake up in the morning and not kill myself?  i don't want to say it, but how is suicide not the answer???"
I have no idea,"The only reason i havent killed myself is because i dont want to make others sad. Im not happy but im not sad either. I take other peoples idea of their own happiness and make it mine. I feed off of other peoples idea of life because i dont have my own. Any relationship ive ever been in was only to give the other person what they wanted, me. Im so ready to give up because i truely honestly have no idea what i want out of life or what i want for my self. I have no goals or ambitions or dreams of how i want my life to be. I just do what others expect out of a person and that is simply to not give up on life. "
Unprepared for this peace to expire,"I've thought about suicide and cried a lot today.I must have written and then deleted several pages of text by now, so how about if anybody really wants to donate their time and energy to listening to me, then ask me what you want to know and we can take it from there.Currently I have a reasonable comfortable existence. For many, many reasons, my current living situation cannot last. It's with my parents.  I don't know of anybody else that would be willing to have me live with them. When this uneasy compromise out of necessity ends, knowing myself, I think it's likely that I'll end up killing myself. Right now, I don't want to kill myself. If I did I wouldn't run the risk of spoiling my chances by telling somebody and I wouldn't use a method that has a chance of being interrupted or failing. That's why it's important that I talk about this now because I don't when I make plans."
My parents are so strict all they want me to do is study and it makes me want to die,Have you talked to them about this? You can bring it to their attention that this is a highly inefficient parenting method for trying to get you to make good grades
I just don't know what to do anymore,Have you ever felt you just have no other way out I do. I am a 26 year old girl and have just had the worst year of my life. My mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of last year and after fighting with all her might sadly passed away in march I just feel empty all the time she raised me on her own and was my best friend. I have a fianc̩ and a 4 year old son but after my mums passing I started gambling much to my own stupidity and I feel I can't stop always chasing that win that just never comes I haven't payed bills am supposed to and now upto my eyeballs in debt and once he finds out he will leave me and take my son with him I just feel I have nothing left to live for and I know my mum would be so disappoint of who I have become I don't even know why I am writing on this maybe just to actually get the truth off my chest
"I don't want to kill myself tonight, but...","I'm a college freshman, and it's been more difficult than I thought. I've made friends who say they care, but I can't shake the feeling that I'll meet someone or already have met someone who will end up hurting me or deserting me. I've only known them for a month but they already know about my suicidal ideation. I've been having panic attacks every night and I'm sick of it. I'm terrified that people are annoyed with me or think I'm seeking attention because of it. I'm terrified that they'll eventually just stop caring and they'll leave. I'm trying to navigate my identity as a polyamorous queer girl but I don't even know how I can do that if I'm terrified of even making friends with people. I know friends are supposed to be there but I can't keep relying on them for support every single night when I know I'll just weigh them down. I can't even pick up the phone to talk to someone. I just want to stop being scared and feel secure. I just want to feel like someone cares besides my parents. I don't want to be alone for four years. "
A friend of mine wanted to kill himself at a party,"Last saturday at a party, a friend (we'll call her Lilly) told me that Alex (one of her best friends, who was in the party that night) wanted to kill himself, probably that same night. In my experience, I know that if you wanna kill yourself you dont really tell anyone unless you want some help from them, so I had my doubts but I was of course worried.  Ok so, by knowing this, now im in a complicated situation, I went to the kitchen to think a bit and Alex appeared, he said like 2 words and then I inmediately started talking about life and trying to be really motivational, he didn't say a word after that, I worried a little more.
About an hour later Lilly comes to me and says ""What the fuck did you tell him?"", Alex had been drinking A LOT and I told him to go outside and have a talk ""guy to guy"". I revealed that Lilly told me his intentions and that I couldnt ignore the fact, we talked like half an hour about his problem, we both cried, Alex told me that he didn't find any inspiration or meaning to his life, he felt like a failure, trying to live up to his parents expectations but ending up feeling useless. He didn't talk about this with almost anyone, he felt really bad about wanting to do it but not wanting any help.
I told him, mainly, that life is extense and full of oportunities of any kind, that he hadnt wasted his life, he's still young, he has a lot of time to get back on track and find meaning. He gave me a big hug and thanked me, but I don't know if he took my message seriously.
We go back inside, a few moments pass and he just keeps on drinking, he seems nervous, I try to make him chill, Lilly appears and Alex kicks her in the leg, I look at him and ask ""Why did you do that?"", he just looks at me and falls to the floor, passed out, we grab him and put him in the couch so he can rest.
I go to the bathroom and while i'm inside I hear Alex yelling at Lilly ""you fuckin bitch! you just think about yourself!"", Alex gets kicked out of the house.
A few minutes pass and Lilly recieves a call from Alex and puts it on speaker mode, we didn't understand him, he sounded very drunk, we both hear a weird sound, like the phone falling to the ground, we inmediately go out and search for him.
I was very scared in the way but we find him a few houses away, lying on the street crying. Their parents arrive at the scene, Lilly called them after Alex was kicked out. I only told their parents ""talk to him"". They took him back home and I hope he's doing well. This whole thing happened between 11pm to 3am (aprox).I'm not looking for advice really, I think he is the only one who can change his mind, but i've never been in a case like this. I, myself, had struggle with suicide in the past but I found inspiration in the unexpected. I never talked someone out of suicide and I hope I didn't make things worse, I just wanted to share this, to kinda take it out of my system and try to understand this whole situation from different perspectives."
Probably won't ever kill myself,"I think about it as an option every now and then, but then I'm like ""well from an honest utilitarian perspective, there's better options than the finality of death. My death would hurt some people, pretty much regardless of any other circumstances. So i can live with my unhappiness.
Maybe i can dedicate my life to helping others? Nah, too much work.
Well if my life is going nowhere i could join the military? But i keep hearing that it's really boring after training, work that they don't need a human to do.
Maybe I'll just do what i like? Hah, like i have that much dedication.
 Just live and work to pay for my survival while distancing myself from others to avoid hurting them? Im too much of a pussy for that.
Well shit."""
Looking for an easy out,"I have no reason to be depressed, and while I have never been clinically diagnosed, I have bouts where getting out of bed is the hardest task I've faced. My life from the outside makes some jealous. Single, good job, nice car, etc. But I'm worn. I'm a caretaker of someone close to me and Im the go to person for many friends. Im a good listener, and I believe I have set the precedent that I can listen but don't need to be listened to. Now for fear of the effects on my job and personal endeavors, if I admit my suicidal desires it would cause additional stress that would be counter productive. I don't want to commit suicide out of desperation or even dark depression. I want to just because it's easy. Logically I understand why I shouldn't, but selfishly and truly selfishly I want to and have for a long time. Just tired of carrying everything alone.I cant tell any friends because I've had others confide in my about their suicidal tendencies and have some understanding of the weight that places on the recipient. So I turn to internet strangers to share my secret and hope if I make up my mind to take the easy way out, at least I leave with one less burden.Thank you for reading and have a blessed day."
Anyone else just want to die,I do so I'm going to. Goodbye Oh who am I kidding no one cares what I do. They will just shrug it off. Edit: I'm sorry if I scared some people. I don't actually want to die. It's just that sometimes I feel like it.
I just can't imagine a future where I'm alive.,"It feels so pointless. It feels like I'm a patient who's been told they have a few months left to live. I know my end result, and I know nothing can change it.I'm so tired."
"Feeling just helpless, wanting to admit myself","So, I went through a very bad year of depression about 1.5 years ago and it's suddenly back. I always feel lost and hopeless and like my life is changing for the worse when it never is. I want a break from everything, and atm the only way I can see that happening is if I kill myself.  I'm back into self harm after that 1.5 clean streak. I don't know what to do. At least it's not as frequent or bad as it used  to be. I want to admit myself to a psych ward but that requires my dad knowing, and I'm not legitimately mentally ill enough to go. I'm probably just attention seeking. So that's not an option. I don't know what to do. Even having fun with friends and having amazing days doesn't fix it anymore. I want to die. I want to self harm. I can't do the first because family is over for the next few weeks.I have a lot of supportive friends but I feel attention seeking when I ask for help, as much as they tell me I'm not. I feel like I'm losing them all although I'm not, our bonds strengthen everyday. I don't see a way out of this life - there's no valid stress in my life rn and I still want to fucking die. I don't know what to do, I'm sorry for rambling. Maybe venting just helps. "
Afraid of both living and dying...,"I'm a pathetic 34 year old virgin nerd who has never kissed a woman and probably never will even though its the thing I want the most in life... I live in a third world country where therapy, meds, online dating, ect none of that is an option... there's nothing really that I think I can do to change my life, I know some people will suggeste prostitutes but that's not what I want, I don't care about sex I just would like to have some level of validation, to know that it's not impossible for a woman to be attracted to me... but I guess it is...I've been trying to land a job abroad so I can move to a first world country but that's also going nowhere... jobs in my field always ask for 3 professional references but I only have 2 and one seems too busy to deliver the letters on time... even if I had the references nobody seems to want to go to the trouble of sponosoring an average applicant for work visa.... the ones I've been able to complete the application I never get the job...I think of kililng myself all the time, I won't do it but I can't stop thinking about it, I don't want to hurt my parents and I am too afraid of dying... but I am also really afraid of living I think of my future and I see nothing but loneliness... I can't help to think that as I get more and more lonely there'll be a day where I can't take it anymore and I do kill myself...I'm at work and should be working but I'm typing here instead because I feel so bad and have no one to talk to and don't know what to do.... I want to cry but tears don't come out, I wish I had friend, someone I could talk to in person , get a hug... but I just don't know how to keep on going "
It's just really overwhelming,"I don't know what to do anymore. The voice telling me things will get better is quieter with each passing day. A little over two years ago, I was left completely on my own, she took everything. My home, my friends, my future. Don't get me wrong, I didn't give up, I fought to try put the pieces back together. Not of our relationship but of my own life. I'd realized that fighting for her love was mute and idiotic. Yeah of course I wanted her back but I wasn't going to fight for it, from the moment she said it was over I knew it was the truth. It sucks to think that when I was with her I was truthfully happy. It sucks that I haven't been able to get to the point that I make myself happy. I thought over time things would get easier and honestly sometimes it is. It's better not to have her stare at me with those ""are you fucking retarded"" eyes she would give me when I would mess up. Some aspects of my life have gotten better like, I'm more financially responsible (even if it feels like it isn't amounting to much), I've lost weight and feel healthier, I've progressed in my professional career. Yes I've been working really hard be a better person, and find happiness or at least the feeling of being ""just okay."" Everytime I get close to being able to breathe I'm pulled under by some random misfortune. I keep telling myself it can't be worse than the day I came home to a red note on the door, but deep down inside it doesn't feel like it's gotten any better. Over the past two years I've made some friends most of them know about my depression. But I don't think any of them really get it. They don't understand that I left the city because everyday I thought about getting to the top of the tallest most accessable building. They don't understand that beneath my love for all living things, the kindness shown to other, the generousity, silver-lining seeking, is just someone who is a constant state of loneliness. That even though I love them and I care about them they can't be there for me the way I need them to be. It's worse having tried making that connection and receiving the blank stare of sympathy. I'm so tired of having to put up the facade that I'm strong, tough, and unwavering. It's moments like these, where I'm sitting alone in my car stranded (due my car battery dying) after calling all my coworkers to no avail, and only then deciding to call them, to be told that I should just get a Uber (which I can't afford) and deal with the problem tomorrow. I'm just sitting here in my steel cocoon surrounded by those tall buildings thinking how easy would it be to get on that one ledge. How easy would be to just disappear on the night I've needed them the most. How much better off would I have been if I'd done it when I was at my lowest and never met them so I wouldn't have to feel as unimportant as I do now. It's enraging to think that if I was called and was needed I wouldn't have hesitated. It hurts to think after all the ""good deeds"" I've done this is the karma I'm rewarded with. All the pain I silently endure, waking up and hoping I don't have to see anyone so I don't have to slap that stupid ass fake smile I charade around. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. I'm tired of pretending I know where this is all leading to. I'm tired of being in charge of making the jokes and listening to everyone when they're sad or afraid. Or worse yet pretend to be happy because they are. I'm tired of silently judging them thinking damn I wish they knew how lucky they really are to not deal with what I deal with. I just want to be myself. I want to be loved because I'm sad. I want to be loved because of who I truly am deep down inside. But I guess who I truly am inside is a burning garbage pile that no one truthfully wants know. I've been trying to fill the void that she left with people, places and, things and I'm so utterly sick of it. I've tried being alone too. I've tried loving someone else. it's not that I'm in love with my ex anymore, I mean I do love her, it's more about the fact that I know that intense flame that we had for each other are cold ashes and I'm buried underneath. I can shake the feeling that one day I'll give in. I'll finally find that open roof access door and I won't hesitate. I'm afraid that the depression and loneliness will take me away from the two dogs I've raised and my mother, my brothers, and my sisters. They know about my struggle but they were also the ones who advised I fill the void she left with people, places, and things. I wish I could start over somewhere new, somewhere where I feel like I belong. Where the scenery isn't full of memories of us, but here I sit  in a dead car waiting for someone to come along rob and murder me or the sun to rise and it be the appropriate time to call again and see if they're in the mood to help. Idk maybe it's all meaningless and I really am asking for too much."
"I did it, I hope.","Just saying bye, I just took 10 Xanex, and am going for my last drive, hope it works."
need help for my new friend.,"���i want to kill myself and everyone thinks im joking�۝
this is when i knew i had to say SOMETHING to her... im just really not good at comforting people, i just don�۪t know what to say. i know how she feels, as im depressed myself currently, but i just don�۪t know how to make her feel better. despite just meeting her, i care and wouldn�۪t want anything to happen to her. please help"
I don't wish to live anymore,"I hate the way I look. I hate everything about my life. My mom is verbally abusive and holds me back doing a lot of things that are considered minor things to others such as letting me get a haircut.  I have never gotten my hair cut and I hate the way it looks on me. I want to get my eyebrows done. I want to learn how to do makeup. I have body image issues. I weigh only 120 lbs and my mom makes me feel as if I'm the heaviest person on the planet. I can't ever hang out with people after school. Even if I do she has to be there with me. I have no social skills due to that. She always favors my brother over me because he's smarter than me. I do decent in school. I could got 100% and she'd still yell at me for something. She won't let me apply to universities that are more 30 min drive away but I don't have a car and for the closest uni i could get into since I don't have a car would require me taking public transportation. It would be a 2 hour ride one way. She won't let me stay on campus. I don't want to miss out on the world but she holds me back in so much that I've just come to hate it altogether. Last year I hurt my back and it still hasn't gotten better despite getting treatment for it. It also makes me depressed. When I went to a specialist, they made me feel out this little survey to see if I was depressed or not and my mom was there and she filled it out for me even though I had wanted to tell him yes I am depressed I need help. Due to my back issues I'm not able to do a lot. I had to quit swimming because it hurt too much and it just didn't feel worth it anymore. I used to self harm but I somehow managed to quit because my mom would have found out. I still wish to harm myself. I want to just slit my wrists or take pills and never wake up again."
I just OD'd on benadryl ibuprofen and some other low grade painkiller,"i feel like shit and i'm trying to type all this before I pas sout cuse i feel like im going to. I felt like hsit for so long and no w i gave up and all my friends are fucking fake and theyre not my friends. They lied to me mother fucker. I hate my family, and i just ddnt know waht to do. "
By the end of the week...,"...if I haven't booked a new customer or gotten a call back for the job I've applied for, I'm ending it."
Kill Myself?,"Okay...so this is one hell of a story, but it's filled with tons of stuff that will make you go ""What...the...fuck..."" so here it is. Story of my life up until now. Summed up. LolI've always been a liar. From as far back as I can remember I had always lied about who I am, what I have, or what I come from. As a child it was about video game consoles, as a teen it was about my age and my family, and as an adult its become everything. I am a 25 y/o male. My parents are divorced after I had walked in on my father and his brothers wife doing some weird stuff at a family reunion when I was 11. In high school I got my first girlfriend, whom I lied to for three years about my age, and when she found out she kinda went off but decided to stay together for another three years. I was 22 when we broke up due to both of us cheating. After graduating high school my mother told our family that I made it into, and was attending xxx university, when nothing of the sort was happening. I decided to just go along with the lie. Instead I was really just attending community college and failing miserably.After my girlfriend and I broke up at 22, I moved to a new city in which I was now telling my family that I had transferring to xxx university. Not the case. I was attending community college, still, and still failing my classes. Not because of partying and hanging out with friends, but because I wasn't getting out of my bed. Well after a year of being in the new city, I was now 23, my family was expecting me to graduate. So, I ordered and paid for graduation invitations, and when the big day came I explained to my family that I had failed a class my last semester which is why my name wasn't in the graduation pamphlet, but the university was still going to allow me to walk the stage, I just wouldn't be receiving my degree until I completed the class I failed. It's something the university does do, so they bought it.So what I did from here was a combination of luck and also very stupid. I walked down, in the cap and gown I had purchased, snuck into the area where all the graduates were hanging out and waited on the side for someone to lay down their name card so I could steal it. Some girl laid it down, and since I am pretty good looking, I walked over to her and started flirting with her allowing me to pocket her card. After that I went to the restroom. Put the card under water and very gently scratched away her name. I then wrote mine in pencil and went to go stand in line. After this we were all walked out and sat down in front of all the families there to watch their loved ones graduate...including mine.. I ended up walking the stage and when asked about my card, I had said that I accidentally dropped it into the toilet and they bought it. They read my name from the card and I walked the stage. My family and everyone I know has absolutely no idea about the stunt I pulled, why would they?After graduating I got a pretty decent job, lying on my resume about graduating, and worked there for two years. During those two years my mom remarried and my step sister was attending UT and we ended up hooking up and then dating those two years. After the two years of working at my new job I decided to apply, and got picked up, by a new company doing a new job. I was clearly not able to perform the tasks, so after 6 months I was asked to resign.I lost my apartment and everything and have now moved in with my father, unable to get an apartment because I just left my last one. I am now working at another pretty nice paying job, and in a couple of months should be able to get my own place, but I am afraid my life will continue down this road. I am very good at my current job, but I just am not sure if I want to live like this my entire life.I am currently dating a girl who is about to graduate from college and the only reason I am dating her is because she is joining the military which will allow me to live a decent life since she will be an officer. Feeling pretty shitty about the whole thing, and don't really like using people like that, but I don't really see any other option other than to rid everyone from myself or man up and tell everyone the truth and eat that shit sandwich I had made for myself."
Are thoughts enough to seek help?,Some days are better than others when it comes to how serious these thoughts are and I often go quite some time without any.I blew my chance to get free psychiatric help through work since I just quit my job that most of my thoughts were stemming from. I also never felt like my thoughts were serious enough to get help
It's too hard,"I can't sleep, I can't get any peace, I live in a care home with annoying cunts who don't know how to shut the fuck up or switch lights off. The staff found a suicide note and knife in my room so my method is gone, and am considering jumping off a cliff close to where I live, my friends at school and I joke about it but I am serious. My psychiatrist offers no help and neither do the staff. Everything every day just causes more inconvenience and suffering for me. I get around 4 hrs of sleep then a 7hr school day. I've been in special schools for half my life and have finally progressed back into mainstream at the cost of not living with my family "
I wanted to kill myself.,"After arguing and it not being the same, my girlfriend ended our relationship. She had been my first girlfriend at uni so the first person I'd spent so much time with: living together, eating together etc. I've always had anxiety and she was always there to help me with it, always understanding and there for me. Over summer we visited each other and she was with me at my dads wedding which was a huge thing for me. As time passed the distance began to take its toll. I'd recently started on anti depressives which effected my sex drive which started to become a huge weight on my shoulders. I became increasingly embarrassed about it but didn't know what to say to anyone. Stupidly while we were getting into things I tried watching 'material' on my phone. She saw this and it broke her. I didn't realise how self conscious she was and how much it effected her. After coming back from the summer and back to university I hoped things would return to normal but it was obvious she was distancing herself from me and it was becoming awkward between us. She took me away for my birthday but it was obvious how awkward it was between us. She gave me my birthday present the day after and I tried everything to spark a conversation between us but because I felt so anxious I couldn't even maintain or start a conversation, I oversaw her speaking to another guy on her phone also which really shook me. Sunday night she came over and ended it. She told me that it had changed for her and that what I did messed her up. She said there was nothing I could do to make her feel comfortable anymore. We both said this isn't how we wanted it to go - but it's the way it's ended up. I told her that I would have to unfollow her on social media and she told me that she didn't really give a shit. I cried uncontrollably, and went to bed. I woke up the next morning feeling a low I never had before and went to buy two bottles of wine. After drinking them two I deleted any social media I had which alerted my family and I was bombarded with texts of worry but I couldn't face anyone. After going through my camera and deleting all the images of her from my dads wedding something snapped, and I decided that I'd had enough. I tried to overdose on my anti anxiety medication, but after googling it I realised that wasn't likely so I decided to look for a pencil sharpener so that I could cut my wrists. As I was looking my mom called me; I picked up and cried uncontrollably. Speaking to my sister and my dad they contacted one of my house mates who stayed with me. My dad travelled up and took me to A & E. I spoke about my issues and we discussed a plan. After taking me back home I insisted that my dad went home as I didn't want to be a burden. Waking up this morning I immediately had an urge to find a razor again, luckily my mom had came up to check and found me. The crisis team was called out and I have just kept crying on and off. I feel lost, in riddled with guilt and have no idea how to deal with it, I would have never have hurt her on purpose and I can't believe that I was so shallow to do something like that to her. She helped me through so much anxiety, but now it seems she doesn't care and I feel so lonely. I'm scared because I don't know how I will react or what I will do from hour to hour. Suicidal thoughts come and go, I just feel incredibly lost."
i just wanna say it i guess,"im miserable. i cant get out of bed most days. everyone hates me. i constantly get misgendered and i know i deserve it. i look like a boy, i know i do. i never will look like a girl. theres 0 chance i can even get hormones until november. im just a fucking piece of shit whose ultimate endgame is suicide. whatever. the world is better off without this mentally ill cunt in it anyways."
My psychologist prescribed me an antidepressant (FLUOXETINE 20mg). has anyone ever tried it? what were the effects on you? any warnings about the side effects? Any weight gain? (the possibility of gaining weight scares me a lot),"I was on that. The first time I used it was in 2016 and I foolishly came off them because I felt like I was getting better.The second time I went on them was two months ago. I went through a really bad breakup just after I started taking them and I was in a total state. I honestly feel like they made me worse because I was really prone to wanting to kill myself. I tried to overdose three times and I cut myself too.I've stopped taking them a month or so ago and I still wanna kill myself but that has nothing to do with the pills, it's because my ex is ignoring me after contacting me. I think the pills made me behave more erratically. I could be wrong, but I don't think they helped me. Take them and if you feel any worse, tell your doctor you wanna come off them.I don't know about gaining weight though."
Having a hard times...,"A couple of hours ago my husband punched me again. In my face. Till the blood. Yesterday I forgot to buy food for our cats and told I am gonna go in the morning. In the morning I got up and realized they have some dry food, well that's ok I thought, I have some time for a morning coffee before the shop. My husband waked up and the first thing he told was not a good morning or smt, he told ""hey, go shop, we need food for cats, go right now!""... I asked him if he is my boss to command me, well I got the answer ""yes and you will do what I told you""... I really couldn't react seriously on that and asked if he is having his days... and got a hard punch in my face... for this! For what?! Well I have been told I deserved it for the way I speak with him... sorry, did I got it wrong or he was trying to tell me he is my boss and I have to obey and and?
That's just an example of my life. That shit all the time happening to me in my family life. He punched me even on our honeymoon more than a year ago. Than he was standing on his knees and begging for forgiveness. Well I guess I am a total idiot. I forgave him and ever since every 2 months we have a fight with punches and hitting (ofcourse me, I never let myself to put a hand on smb else).
The problem is that to be with him I leaved my family, friends and good job in my country and moved to live in Europe. Except him I don't have here nobody. I have a couple of people I know here, but we are not in such close relationships to tell them what a ruins my life really is. I see I am not needed to my husband. The way he behave with me tells enough. But I also know I am not needed to my family. Every time I try to say I feel bad and wanna go home they tell me smt like it was my choice and giving me a feeling that I disappointed them. And that I probably will be a total disappointment if I will come back.
I more and more beging to feel I have no place in the world. I see I am not needed to anybody around me. Yes I have husband, friends, parents... and what's the point? One can't see me anymore and behaves with me like I am a peace of shit, another's not even a little waiting me back home and my friends? Well I know they will feel sorry for me and in the same time happy they aren't on my place...       I just want don't want to be hurt no more. I am so tired of emotional pain. I never was thinking about suicide. But last time I just can't stand no more. People whom I live with, they don't treat my words serious. They think it's on emotions. Maybe in the beginning it was so. Maybe I wanted their attention, wanted to feel I am needed and loved. But not anymore. It already more deeply problem and i realize it. No matter what I do this thought is always in a background of my mind. Specially in such a bad days like today. I don't feel like smb is actually care.  Probably nobody have too. It's a dark side of my life I have to deal with myself. But smt you just wanna tell things you struggling through to smb else and to know you not alone."
Thought things were getting better. I was wrong.,"I was so close to killing myself last year, I had a plan and everything. But then I told myself, ""just keep it going a while longer, see how it goes"". So for the next few months I tried so, so hard to put myself out there. It was absolutely exhausting, but I  thought people were actually beginning to value me and enjoy my company. I even started getting close with a girl I really liked.The last few weeks have shown me how much of a fucking idiot I was to believe any of it. Nothing's changed, it's all been in my head this whole time. Yesterday gave me conclusive proof that no one gives two shits about whether I'm around or not. God I feel like such a dumbass for letting myself get my hopes up. I can't do this again. I just don't have the energy. "
I�۪m tired.,"I�۪m just tired. I�۪m done. I get up, spend seven hours in school where I hate both everyone around me and myself, come home, and sleep. Maybe half the time I�۪ll wake up to get food, and then I go back to sleep. Life just isn�۪t worth the energy I used to put into it; not when I get fucked over anyways. "
Here I am again,For some stupid reason I'm still alive. I'm about to flunk out of grad school but I guess sometimes part of me is still holding out hope that that won't happen. Even worse the most likely outcome is that I won't fail out but I'll be here a really long time as a pain in the ass mediocre student that the professors can't wait to get rid of. I don't know why I don't just end it all now. It's all I can think about but I don't have the courage.
Talked to a suicide hotline today. Literally useless,Yea they made me feel worse when I talked to 1 too.
a gun...,...is surprisingly not that hard to get.
This could be the end...,"Screw myself. I'm so fake. Cannot take this anymore, I don't feel connected to the world, or to anybody. I feel like a distant observer not being able to interact genuinely. What's the point of continuing and pushing thru when in the end I gotta suffer for the rest of my life. I'm just peering out my eye sockets not even knowing myself which is the worst. Am I going crazy or is this just another emotional phase. All I know is this can't keep going on or I'll pull someone down with me. Which in this time is my family. I can't seem to let anybody into my life, be close to a person, even having a friend. I don't know if the past made me this way, having being sexually abused as a kid. Months back when I got better I thought I could change my mentality but in reality it's just a character I want people to see me, it's fake. I admire people who are just themselves, they seem to have a soul and a Life. But I'm just a empty shell. Useless. Scared. And alone. "
Getting ducks in a row,"I feel like I've run out of gas. I've been putting so very much energy into fighting my depression and ideations while trying so hard to help myself through transitioning. Months ago I had a week long vacation with my best friend planned. We were going to gencon for the first time ever. That very first day I had of of work I attempted to kill myself and feel I came close. I was found by another suicidal friend and she with my best friend nursed me back. I didn't want to survive and have been wrestling with that since. I've been crying and stuck on the couch since yesterday. I've now cancelled plans this week and therapy appointments. Today I documented my assets and where I'm intending them to go. I ordered the second part of my suicide plan online and it arrives any day. it's been tough not being rash while I wait for the package and falling back to another method but I didn't follow my plan the first time. Suicidal friend had wanted previously to make a suicide pact with me but she doesn't know how bad off I am yet and while it's tempting to let her know, I don't want to watch her hurt herself too though I know me doing this will trigger her as well either way... Best friend had had been touched by suicide in her life before and she's an amazing and loving person but I just can't handle much longer. I'm surrounded by amazing loving supportive people: parents, suicidal friend who adores me, best friend, little brother and an older sister. The trouble is after a lifetime of suppressing my emotions and who I am, it's overwhelming to try and cope with those same emotions I've run from for so long. Running has only ever added a equal part of regret to everything as well. I'm transgender... I was raped by family... That will always be part of me and I hate myself for it and so much more. I just need to hold it together until my package arrives... Then I can try to find some self peace and I can only hope that those I hurt so much can themselves move on."
"I'm still alive (or, why I can't die yet).","There are two reasons why I haven't killed myself. The first is that I don't want my mom to outlive me - she's been through so much and worked so hard to be happy, that I absolutely can't kill myself while she's alive. I couldn't do that to her. So that's reason #1.Reason #2 is ridiculous. I feel like I can't kill myself until I've done something worthwhile. Until I've succeeded at accomplishing something notable - publishing a bestseller, making a million in the stock market, whatever. Something that justifies the fact that for a brief moment, I was alive. Only when I've found that peace will I be able to die. I absolutely refuse to kill myself now and die a failure. I'd be fine killing myself if I were successful. And there's that tiny sliver of hope, an irrational hope, trying to keep me alive by refusing to let me succeed. Does this make any sense?Good night."
Why can't i just turn life off,"Everyday when i'm trying to sleep i hope to not wake up, it would be perfect.
I just can't understand so many things that it drives me crazy. I have a great family i love them, i am smarter than most, i'm healthy (at least my body is), but i can't do anything. I stared 2 colleges but could not finish either one, i'm 24 but in all my life I worked for 4 months.
Live today is just waiting for death to come, i'm doing treatment and taking my medicine for 2 years already and still think the same way, I'm not in a hurry to die, but I know that I'm on a cliff, the only thing holding me is the love for my family, I don't want to taint them with a son who killed himself I don't want my mom to suffer, but that's it and to live a life where the only thing I need to do is go to therapy twice a week I may be enough, but to live a life where I have to suffer everyday fighting against my own head to do things that's absolute natural to others is not even close to being enough.
It's scary to say that to someone that knows me or knew me, they always feel that my problems is not problems at all, that everything I'm going through is normal for everybody and even me thinks that way sometimes.
I can't understand how and why some people have the energy to wake up everyday and go to work at something they don't like. I know the answer most of times, they need the money to survive, but what would make me leave my house? Survival is not important to me.
I never had plans, never in my whole life I earned money and thought ""oh, now I can do that shit that I really wanted to do"". What happened was that I months after earning that I searched for a way to use it that would not be a waste.
The last time that I had sex was 8 years ago, the last time I kissed a girl was 6 years ago. Now the only thing I feel when I see someone attractive is anger, anger for still feeling attracted to them, everytime I catch my self looking at a girl I go mad, I want to go blind, everytime I have to interact with someone beautiful I feel bad, first I get anxious then I get mad at myself.
One year and something ago I download tinder, it was my last try at getting to know someone new, even just friends, but I found out that I have nothing to offer, why would someone go out with me? And found that I can't make new friends, I'm to scared to meet them, I'm too anxious to talk to them, receiving a message just make me feel bad, I don't have anything to offer and if I don't control myself I start to lie and it helps at the time but it turns everything worst at the future, it's like I have to study before every conversation so I don't say something stupid.
It looks so easy for almost everybody and I suffer so much to do it, I just want to turn me off in a way that I'll not hurt my parents, but even this is hard for me. "
Sometimes I want to end my life because of codependent relationship with NMom. Working on improving myself to get better job so I can move out. 25F in a codependent and emotionally abusive dynamic between parents. Mom vicariously lives through me and I constantly talk about her with strangers.,"I'm 25F and graduated college. I had several job offers, but decided to stay at home because of financial reasons. I want to move out soon, but make excuses because of my HOARDING. I always think I get better but don't. I haven't had healthy friendships or relationships in ages. I lost my identity because I let my parents control and make decisions for me.For example at Christmas when my extended family asks me what I've been up to my mom buts in and starts talking on my behalf. Currently seeing a therapist, but my therapist isn't helpful. I use my mom to vent about boys and life especially in college. But in reality she uses me to vicariously live her failed dreams.I tell her too much about work and she acts like she knows my coworkers and bosses when she never met them. She likes to assure my life is great working minimum wage in retail as a college graduate, when in reality it's not.She tells me my boss is great because he underschedules me but gives me hours later. Yet I'm making minimum wage on call.She plays the at least you're not like the people in Africa, Europe, or Hurricane Harvey card. She didn't believe in my anxiety and depression until my cousin got treated for mental illness a year ago.She likes to deny and be passive aggressive. She pretends to apologize but not sincerely. She blames how I don't respect me yet she doesn't respect me or my remaining family.I constantly go back for her for support when I don't need to. I like to talk about my life because I LOVE venting. I journal and rant personally to myself (even with my plushies) but it's not enough because I stopped talking with my friends two years ago because she didn't want me to drive 90 minutes to see my close friends. (Since I don't have my own car but now they let me use their car for work.)She tells me which guys to date. For example my ex was blondish and she wanted me to date brunettes because she's attracted to them.I don't know why I'm worthless enough to have her want to control me. I'm nothing special.When I put myself down she's personally offended. Do you know why? Because she see's me as an extension or herself, so I'm essentially putting herself down.I'm taking steps to improve myself and going to therapy, but it's taking TIME.Sometimes I want to end my life because of codependent relationship with NMom. Working on improving myself to get better job so I can move out. 25F in a codependent and emotionally abusive dynamic between parents. Mom vicariously lives through me and I constantly talk about her with strangers. Trying to move out but I don't want to this year. Help?"
Why? What�۪s the point?,"I genuinely don�۪t understand why I�۪m still here. I don�۪t see a point to living. We all die eventually and nothing in this world matters. Why live a life when you�۪re sad all the time and there�۪s no end game?I feel like I�۪m getting more and more disconnected from reality by the day and there�۪s nothing that can be done to change how I feel. I want to go ahead and get life over with, it doesn�۪t make any sense anyway."
Quick suicide methods,I've been in pain too long
What is happening to me?! I'm going mad!!,"I'm not quite sure how long I've been feeling this way but I can tell you that it feels like it's been forever. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. Lately I've been feeling extremely lifeless and hopeless. Time is flying by and i feel numb to that. I'm just going through the motions of life. I have quite a bleak outlook on my life and I often think nothing will get better and there's nothing I can do about my situation. I've lost interest in things that used to bring me joy. I can't seem to get myself out of bed in the mornings and simple tasks always seem to be an uphill battle. It takes a lot of motivation for myself to do these simple tasks. I have a hard time falling asleep at night because my mind is just high of thoughts and in the mornings I can't get myself out of bed because I don't have he energy or motivation. I'm not hungry throughout the day and whenever I am hungry I'm too tired to get up and make myself food so I just order food in. I've gained weight because of my unhealthy eating habits. I've become quite aggressive with people who are close to me in my life. I keep pushing them away for no reason. I guess you could say the relationships have become toxic because of me. I have a hard time remembering things and whenever I forget them and need to be reminded I feel like a complete idiot for forgetting. Often times the things I forget are fairly important things which shouldn't be forgotten. I have to write things down, otherwise I will forget them. I often feel like there's a huge build up of anger and anxiety in me so I've found a toxic coping mechanism. That coping mechanism is cutting and burning my own skin. I am aware that it's toxic and extremely bad but it helps make me feel so much better."
It's inevitable. I wish it wasn't.,"Today is really hard. Every day is hard. I don't know how much longer I can make my way through life. I won't kill myself but it feels fixed, and I don't think there's any way for me to recover and so I'm in limbo."
Here not looking for help with preventing my death but help with making it happen,"Please don't try to give me the ""don't do it"" stuff, I think what you guys do is great but in my situation I'd rather you help me do the opposite. I need help with mentally preparing myself and whatnot.I just need that blueprint or whatever, if you cant post it here then messaging me would work too. Thank you"
Tonight is the night I do it,"Goodbye, I hope you've made the best decision for yourself."
I just want to talk,"I'm a teen. A teen girl.
I get mood swings, whatever.
Two days isn't going to fix me, but the pain I feel right now is unbearable. I felt better after reading the comments on my last post. People actually cared.
I just want someone to know I still feel suicidal. I don't know.
This seems selfish of me.
I'm just upset with myself. I want my family to know how I feel. That will only really in my own death.
Lately I've been taking hour long bike rides around my town to get my brain going, to focus on things I don't usually focus on. In the back of my mind I'm still thinking
I know I'm terrible. Two days isn't going to fix me. School is still terrible. My teachers can be too. They make me feel bad.
Why am I like this? It's been two days but it feels like two years. I'm tired all the time and I'm stressed all the time, even if I'm doing nothing. Even if I have to run  errand.
Why do I always need help? Why can't I be independent like other people? My whole life I always depend on people. I want to make my own decisions. But at the same time I want someone to help me.
I want to kill myself yet I want to walk into the hospital and tell them what's wrong. They wouldn't do anything. But at least professions would know.
I'm a bomb. One day I will explode.
Each day I take a step closer to the edge. I don't want to. But life is just too hard.
Just. Please.
Help me.
I want help. I want to feel better.
I want someone to rescue me and that's selfish of me I'm sorry."
"Just wasted $10,000","My professor was going to drop me from class if I didn't show up today. I'm sick though, professor, I can literally be off the toilet for no more than 15 minutes at a time or I'll shit myself. I'm still gonna get dropped, though I'm waiting for health services to try and help me out. Why would I go to class and get others sick? This is a golden rule in the industry, if you're sick, do not expose others to the illness.Anyway, was probably just dropped from the class, so there's $10,000 and a semester wasted. I can feel the sweet embrace coming to comfort me in this trying time. Death has got my back."
"I'm too stupid to learn or improve, really just want to die",I work 14-16 hours a day on my classes and nothing EVER MAKES FUCKING SENSE NO MATTER WHAT I FUCKING DO. I'm in a fucking light courseload and I spend every second of every fucking day trying to do work and make no progress. I have no friends. I've never been in a relationship and never will. I'm in horrible shape and overweight. Despite this and studying constantly I'm failing all my classes with low Fs and every day I fall further behind because my stupid awful brain never gets anything. I really just want to fucking kill myself and probably will once these grades get closer to sticking. My life is headed nowhere and never will be and I'm better served in a ditch than stretching out the inevitable.
Only happy when asleep,"I posted a lengthy post in this forum so I won't get into it again. I can't survive another new years day. That's my most depressing day next to halloween, both because I know everyone and my so called friends will be out with friends celebrating and everyone else in the u.s. screwing around having fun while I take medications so I sleep through it because I can't stand the thought of everyone having a good time but me. I even sleep through my birthdays. The 30 or so people I thought were my friends that I've known for years in real life, not one of them wished me a happy birthday this year, only 2 online friends did which I've never met. And like I said in a previous post no one would know I'm dead. I'm going to grow old and alone, no kids, no gf. I'm the youngest in my family so I should be the last to go. I am in considerable debt so I probably couldn't afford any funeral plans and so when I die alone I will have no family to claim me and so the state will do the cheapest thing which is to burn me up in a oven and throw the ashes in the trash."
"I'm thinking of ending it soon, possibly tomorrow","My life is in shambles. I served in the military, had several good IT jobs when I got out, but then everything went to shit when I quit to take care of my dying grandfather. He passed not long ago and I'm not handling it well. He was a father to me. I'm not independent anymore. I've been couch surfing and my dog, my only source of motivation and love, it's getting to the point where I don't think I can take care of him bc I'm struggling so much.I've PTSD and severe depression. I've been hospitalized twice before at Veterans Affairs hospital for suicidal thoughts. I've been trying to get a full time, trying to get my own place... but my credit is shitty now and I'm working bullshit part times just to feed myself.I just don't see the point anymore. Every single day is a struggle and every day my debt increases. I don't see a future for myself. I don't see a light."
My friend needs help and I don't know what to do anymore.,"So, my friend is gonna try to kill himself tomorrow. This isn't the first time he's tried and I don't know how I can help him anymore. He tried to do it on Christmas of last year. He's been cutting for a while and seemed fine as if he started to feel better about himself. I know his home life is horrible as that his mom treats him like shit. I've never actually met him but I do know how old he is and how he usually acts. I've known him online for a while and know that he really can't handle the stress. I don't know what to do. Help, please."
I don't know anymore,I have school and so much work and I don't know what to do I HATE school with a burning passion but there's no way my parents will ever let me drop out. I have no free time due to school and I can't just be absent or it will make it worse I've been working for so long and I have an essay do tomorrow on a book I haven't even read yet nor started and I have to finish it before class. I don't know what to do anymore I'm exhausted
I just want to go home and sleep.,Me too. I'm so tired of this shit job I wanna die.
My Family And Everyone I know Hate Me.,"Ok so your probley wondering what this is all about well I'm in school right now (not literally of course) And I HATE School Absolutly HATE It And the Teachers are being Assholes They Tell me what i should and shouldn't do well your probably thinking ""Oh there teachers there suppose to tell you what to do"" well no they don't trust me and they expect me to trust and be fucking nice to them, one time (Fucking loads of Times, or started in Year 1, YEAR 1) My so called 'Best friend' Said I fucking swore and (I was 5) and it happened in Year 2 and Year 3 Finnaly on in Year 3 she left and my other so called freind said he wished I left school instead of her  (I'm in Year 9 now) When I was in Year 4 the teacher was pissed at me cause I done something wrong and she said to me I should kill myself and Bare in mind I was 8 Years old and My Year 4 teacher said I SHOULD KILL MYSELF And I didnt know what to do, after that I moved to a different school and it was going ok unroll my Year 6 teacher was there (She was the teacher that stuck up for my 'Best freind') and From the rest of year 4 upwards She made it HELL she started telling lies about me and being a bitch and guess what Every other teacher and everyone else believes Her and I was fucking pissed. After I was in Year 7 and I was ecited at first but after a while I hated it I was trying everything to get it of not going and when I went I walked out and when the Teachers found out they told my nan and my nan told my grandad then my auntie (I live my my auntie and grandparents)and my nan was pissed at me she and my auntie said to my nan at the end of Year 7 ,that I wasn't going to do it again and what did I do I for again and again and again and one time my 'freind' in Year 10 well Year 11 now she was taking the piss out of me |on the phone|She said ""you fucking idiot why did you do that"". My Reply to her ""I'm not fucking stupid"". She couldn't phone me |so I texted her witch is a bad idea now| I said: ""wtf fuck off if your gonna be like that then"" she phoned me and called me an c u next tuesday and told me to kill myself but she didn't tell the teacher that did she and the teacher believed herI'm sorry i did this it's just that I have no one to talk to and this is the only way it's just that I wanna die"
I'm tired,"I'm so tired of everything happening in life now because I don't see an end point and everything seems pointless and foggy... I'm still in school so I have no idea what I'm working so hard for because unlike my friends, I don't have an occupation in mind to aim for. All I know is that I need to keep achieving good grades (and I hate that everything is about grades now), but I don't understand what I'm trying to do because I keep asking myself why I'm working so hard if I don't know what I'm working hard for and I can't even answer that. My life seems really stagnant and I get really moody and emo because I overthink a lot of stuff like my friends not caring about me and stuff... My exams are coming and my grades have been declining so I feel even more demoralised. I feel like nobody understands me but it feels horrible to keep everything inside at the same time. I've thought of not giving a shit about anything and just going to do what I want and have fun, but society reminds me that society won't ever let me do what I want. I really hate everything now and the only thing making me feel alive is music. (I'm not suicidal or anything I'm just really really tired)"
Rage against the dying of the light.,"Fuck depression. Fuck it so fucking much. I just met a wonderful girl and we went on our first date two days ago and second date today. It was amazing, she's perfect and we mesh so well together it's scary. Tonight out of no where I just became depressed as hell. A few days ago I watched a video of a little girl that has experienced dying a few times and that video scared the hell out of me. Basically she said that there was no way to go out peacefully and that no matter how you prepare that you fight dying, kicking and screaming inside and it's terrifying. I hope that's true. I want to die tonight, fuck me. There's no reason for it. My job is fine, my schooling is going well, I'm loving life and really hope things work out with this amazing girl but I can't fucking care tonight. I get sick just thinking of texting her and bringing her into this hell that I carry inside of me. FUCK!!!! I hate this so much and fuck tears and fuck this world FUCK ME!!!"
Should I say goodbye?,"I think you should tell people how you feel, I think suicide is a permanent option that most of the time results out of a temporary issue. You're going to die, that's true and I'm in no position to judge how that happens but to do it by your own hand is taking fate and whatever else we take for granted away, you're consciously taking away tomorrow and tomorrow all your problems could just go away.You also write about ""saying goodbye"" which makes me believe you obviously have people that care about you and in turn, you must care about them. Do you really never want to see your friends, family, or whoever again? Do you really not want them to witness your success and your future? Do not be irrational about this, death is the thing you have to be most rational about. It's cliche but the evidence tells us you only live briefly in this tiny gap of life between two infinite voids of darkness. This could be it, buddy, and you're going to end it early?!
If you truly believe this and think this way and you're utterly convinced and you think it is the only possible solution (bearing in mind people with terminal illnesses and life sentences often decide again it) then you've got to at least talk to someone; someone you care about, about what you're going through and why. It's only fair to the ones you love.Personally, I'd say life is a lot more profitable than death because you're here and it's now. Death will come, just wait, that's all you have to do from damning the ones you love to a lifetime of sadness and regret. It's also good for you because meditating on this fact means you'll realise that you're not tied down to anything, problems are only ephemeral you can tackle them.I hope you talk to someone. Death doesn't hold an answer, it is only an inevitability."
"slipping back into ideation, no one to talk to","recently i was rejected from a position i've basically worked 3 years to be able to feel confident in applying to. i haven't really thought of alternatives should i get rejected, i recognize that's my fault. i just feel really disappointed and hopeless, i was hoping to use this to gain experience for my future plans but now that i don't have this i don't know what to do anymore. i don't know what my future will look like. i don't see the point in anything anymore. i've been contemplating a few different methods available to me and i can't talk to the people close to me in my life because i don't want to re-traumatize them, i don't want to get pulled out of school, i don't want to get pushed to the edge, and some of them i don't want to overload. i just don't know where to go anymore aside from death. i also feel like this is another failure in the string of failures in my life proving i'm just not good enough for anything, and will never be good enough for anything."
I just took 120g of Fluxodine. Am I going to be okay,"I just impulsively took 120g of fluxodine (It's an anti-depressant), not wanting to kill myself I just needed to for some reason. I'm feeling numb, but am I going to be okay? Please help."
I'm so lonely...,"I'm sobbing uncontrollably while I write this, attempted to kill myself Sunday night, obviously didn't work. I've been held captive by my suicidal depression since I was 12, I'm 21 now, nearly half my life and the longer this stays with me the less and less I remember life before this disease. I need companionship, female companionship. I have about 3, maybe 4 friends if you really stretch it, none of them women, even though they are the best people I know and they've helped me out through this as best as anyone can be expected to when they hear a close friend wants to kill themselves (I hate making my problems everyone else's.) I need a real relationship, a tender, intimate love to save me from what I've attempted 2-3 times (nothing makes me feel lower than fucking up a suicide attempt,) but I'm so terrified of rejection because I feel like if I keep getting shot down I'll be known as that loser who can't make it with anyone. I don't really have anything in common with anyone my age, I'm a guitarist (who can hardly play the scales or stay in rhythm after playing for 4 years and taking lessons with teachers who've had decades of experience all along the way) who loves 60s-70s psychedelic and blues and jazz music and I fucking loathe today's pussy ""rock"" music and shitty rap that everyone I know adores. I guess you can say I march to the beat of my own drum, but when everyone else in the proverbial drum line is drumming another way and the crowd notices the one rogue drummer, I can't help but feel embarrassed for sticking out like such a weirdo. And because of this I feel like an alien who doesn't belong with the rest of humanity. I could never tell my folks about this because it'd break their hearts, and I just can't see that happen. I'm trapped in a purgatory between wanting to kill myself and feeling selfish knowing I'll leave a void and break my mom and dad's hearts, not wanting anyone to know what's wrong with me and expecting everyone to read my mind and just get it from looking at me. All this is making college impossible, and I'm hesitant to see the school's therapist because I had a friend who went to Northwestern that did the same thing when benzos and coke and alcohol were making him suicidal and the therapist got the cops involved and stuck him in an in-patient facility, called his parents (who had to make the haul from Indiana to Chicago) and he had to drop out. NOT happening, NOT an option, but I need professional help that my parents will have no idea of my seeing."
Missed my chance. Now what ?,"I had planned to sneak out of my home , borrow the car, and take a drive for 2 hours to a cliff face not far away. When the time came I could not muster the courage to do this so stayed at home. Now my options have become very limited. I can only hang myself or jump in front of a train. I cannot stay around into October. I must find a way out. I had my chance and blew it. I am so disappointed in myself. Partial suspension seems the 'painless' way out but I have not had any success in achieving unconsciousness from test runs. Short drop looks the only way to go but will be very uncomfortable for an unknown amount of time. I don't want to jump in front of a train as it will mean involving innocent people which I do not want. I am hurting, I am fed up of taking medication from doctors that don't work. I just want out. "
The End,"After 4 years of battling suicidal thoughts and self harm, I feel like my strength has been exhausted. My feelings spiralled again and I've been stuck in this cycle of self harm and suicidal thoughts while trying to stay sane and focus because my finals start tomorrow. I've never told anyone ��� my friends or family ��� about how I'm feeling because, long story short, it never ends well. I'm planning to do it today because at this point I am honestly so, so tired and all I want is to be okay. I know I'm being weak because every time I'm that close to committing suicide I used to be able to pull myself back, but at this point I'm giving up becuase things don't look like they'll ever get better."
Is there anyone I can talk to?,I really need a friend right now
I really don't know how I am supposed to live,"4th Year College kid that is currently miserable, going to be 120k in debt for education and not knowing will I ever be able to pay it off. Felt like I made the wrong decision choosing the school. My parents make horrible financial decisions and I am literally helping my dad pay stuff while I'm still in college. I know that I have no hope in really establishing a family or anything. I don't see a future in myself. Idk what to do."
I keep having thoughts about killing myself,"This is a throwaway because my husband knows my regular username. I can't help just thinking about how easy it will be to kill myself. I want to do it but I can't bare to put my kids through that pain. Besides my kids and husband I truly believe no one else will miss me. I've tried it in the past and sadly I was unsuccessful.I'm the sole provider for my family. I have a job that most people consider wonderful. I constantly fake being happy. It hurts to fake it but I have to. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. My life insurance doesn't cover suicide.  So I've been slowly building up a savings account with my ""fun"" money just in case. I have no friends anymore. I can tell Reddit because I'm anonymous here.  I'm tired of waiting to die. I've tried therapy in the past and it never helped.  I just want this to end."
Hanging on a thread,"Hi I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go.Very long post ahead.
Advanced sorry for the shitty formatting.So I'm currently with a girl (we havent been together for long) and this is the happiest time of my life so far. I'm dead set on making this work. At the beginning I thought that if this fails, I'll never go for a relationship again but it turned into something worse. I'd literally choose her over everything. Every outcome I aim for is literally for our relationship and time together(or so i'd like to think) .I was a bit depressed and a bit suicidal before we got together. Just a bit. No actual acts involved. Though I was thinking very hard to go to a therapist because I felt I was going down that sad inevitable path.Now I realized that I became fully dependent to her. There were times we came close to a breakup and my thoughts were only zeroing in to suicide. Like there was never another option but that.She's nice but sometimes she'd like to mess with me (not very serious) but sometimes because of anxiety and trust issues I'd take it seriously but she still won't stop. (for instance I asked who's this guy then she'd answer in a manner that'd make anyone think there's something between the lines).Sometimes it leads to an endless cycle of fight that would end up with me apologizing like I'm begging for my life. Because I probably am.A hint of cheating(although unlikely) from her would also give me attacks of ""those"" thoughts. And it' d be enough to keep me wide awake until it gets resolved somehow. We havent fought for a time now. And I'm desperately fighting to keep it this way and fortunately there hasnt been anything weird hsppening lately but it's inevitable. I just want to make sure that I'll make it through next time. With her fortunately. In my current state, I probably wont last 3 weeks without talking to her. I'd be dead by the end of the 2nd week. I'm wish I am joking but I have enough anger and sadness to push myself from a high place when I'm at a really bad place. (almost seriously did it once. Stood on top of a footbridge for almost two and a half hours. The only thing that kept my feet on the ground was the fact that she hadn't broken up with me yet but was very close to doing so) Everything my life is depends on this relationship right now. I have a lot of hobbies but nothing makes anything work in me when we're fighting. Even the things I love the most turns into nothing when we're fighting. I'm paralyzed. So basically, I want to be less dependent. For the sake of both of us. Having someone commit suicide because of you is kind of traumatic(at least for me).If she ever breaks up with me, i want to last a bit longer than two weeks. She may get convinced that she's not the reason or something. I dont know. Im a mess. I dont even have a reason for writing this right now. I just think I should. Having to live without her is something I can never do at this point. This is the cringiest thing ive ever written but I have no other way of asking for help. "
Advice?,"I've been depressed and anxious for as long as I can remember. I'm hyper sensitive of my environment & overly empathetic, which leads to panic attacks and intense bouts of depression  For the most part, it's been pretty manageable; I'd see a few therapists here and there, keep myself occupied with school work. My doctors seemed to believe my calm, level-headed demeanor signified the problem was moderate and didn't push a strict treatment plan of any sort.A few years before I graduated from college, I had an accident that led to chronic headaches--at its worse, I had a nearly year long headache. My hyper sensitivity increased; I found myself having an insane amount of trouble managing crippling emotions. The headaches subsided, but the moods worsened. My panic attacks became more frequent, the depression was a growing black cloud obstructing my life. I started experiencing what I suppose would be described as an auditory hallucination: it sounded like someone screaming in my head, the epitome of madness. She'd insist that everything sucked, no one liked me, I'd be better off dead. This voice started to dominate me. I was given a medication for the anxiety. Then, I tried a few antidepressants, but they made the suicidal urges worse so I stopped.Recently, the depression and its voice have been so loud I've literally started to feel like I am losing my mind. I feel hopeless, lethargic. Nothing interests me. I don't care about anything, not even myself. I can't maintain positive habits. The howling darkness consumes every facet of my attention. All I want to do is sleep so I don't feel anything at all... I know the feeling, like everything, can be temporary, but this is persisting stronger than ever. I moved a few weeks ago and am in between doctors, I won't be able to have an appointment for several more weeks. Until then, does anyone have any advice? When you feel like everything is meaningless and there's no point in even trying, how do you go on? What motivates you to persist when you'd rather give up?Thank you for reading ���"
Fuck everything,"Not a day goes by without me wanting to shoot someone and/or myself. There's nothing particularly wrong with my environment, I'm just fucked in the head. I'll take a good thing and ruin the shit out of it. I'm in college, 2nd year. I was diagnosed with depression in my 1st year. The social anxiety was murdering my fuckin soul and everytime I would step out of my dorm I would feel like everyone is judging me. I hate it. I've been on Zoloft for 5 months now and I have mental breakdowns every other day. I want to kill someone. I fantasize about shooting the people that done me wrong in the past. Even if you took a measly 5 dollars from me I still want to kill you. My friends are all doing better than me by a long stretch and I hid away the fact that I have depression from them. My parents know but they don't understand my pain. Sometimes I feel like no one does. I ask myself what I did to deserve this and then I realize that it's all self inflicted. I let the only girl that ever loved me get away and it was done by my own hands. Was the IG clout worth it bro? Was it? Fucking moron. Nowadays the only thing that keeps me going is basketball. I really like playing it, even though I'm not good at it. Only thing keeping me from ending it all. I can interest girls but eventually they lose interest because..I'm me. I can't even express my feelings. Haven't gotten pussy in monthes. Send help. I want to kill but I know I lack the balls. Are you a man or a mouse? I can't stop overthinking. I'm so paranoid I feel like someone's gonna shoot up my house. Help me? Please? Please? I feel like shinji."
i can�۪t handle it anymore,"so i�۪m gonna tell you a little about me. i�۪ve just recently turned 15. i have always had eating problems, i remeber times from 2nd grade where i refused to eat certain foods. i�۪m now to the point where i eat about 15 different foods. i normally have cereal for breakfast, chips for lunch , and cereal for dinner. i am sick all the time, and my anxiety has gotten so bad. my legs shake, i feel nauseous, & i�۪m dizzy. i can�۪t take it anymore, the only thing stopping me is my little brother & my best friend. i don�۪t want them to have to go on without me & be sad. please help me.

(Asked to cross post so i will but pretty dead set) While answering the wife whos mad at husband for making plans when her surprise party got cancelled i thought i should share it as a warning to those seeing early red flags but march forward. Stay safe and dont fall in love with just anyone.,"You are such a horrible self centered person... his birthday... didnt tell him or even warn him, then get mad at him for things not going your way, then make a low key complaint about how the people you invited didnt go and you didnt even include his friends HE chose to spend his bday with... like as a wife how do you not know the people he would want to spend his day with? And again flip it on him and get mad he doesnt want the same people as you... why did all of ""his"" friends cancel on his bday when they were already available that day for him? Then on his birthday you resting bitch face him and intentionally be a sour puss on his birthday cause you didnt get your way and you dont like mma? And the worst is having the nerve to justify all your shitty behaviour by using the pms excuse.. like come on its not the 50s. You come across so spoiled and he thanked you for being bitch but letting him go thru with his own plans... fucking toxic relatiomship and he fucking loves you and puts up with it... Sorry but i just got ended 6 years of a relationship with someone i swear was you her self if not married..and me loving her and being the type to just let things go on top of you/her making everything into a giant fucking drama filled marathon where pleasing you/her is dam near impossible. Get into disagreement... i yell cause im mad cause shes yelling at me. Get told im to aggressive and hurt her feelings cause a man shouldnt yell and be able to take it. So i stopped yelling in fights and stayed silient and got told i didnt care. She kept attacking my man hood thru whole relationship and since yelling and staying silient/trying to walk away for a second to calm down is unacceptable i broke down and cried during a fight out of shear frustration since thats her goto and thought she will finally understand and got told ""you look such like a little bitch when you cry"" why cant you act like a man?"" Icing on the cake? She cheated on me with coworker who only texted her late around1-3 am when doing coke and drinking to fuck but she shouldnt tell anyone. He was embarassed people would know and she thought she was the shit. And told me its a mature relationship. Oh i went thru drug problem before this and she said me using discusted with me.. i was clean over a year, worked out regularly but yet coke head drunk fuck was hot still.. the truth was his giant dick helped her overlook most things and made her back the default position... my dick is 7 inches.. i know its only average but she literally told me it was mezmerizing and it hurt at first when apologising and asking me back cause he ignored her and wouldnt date... then a series of me taking her back followed by her cheating, leaving and fucking her friends while lying then admitting it to leave me for a week then rinse repeat... now shes the mother of my child we dont get along im a fucking masocist cause i love her to death even though she literally crippled me with mental pain and heart break and when i couldnt deal with it all and act like nothing happened or ever let it effect my opinion or trust of her she left me turned her nose up to my pain, belittles me and is now just fucking people for fun while telling me to be a better dad.i just want her back and be a family and be with my daughter but will never happen... i get her one day every 2 weeks and my biggest fear is she wont remember me or love me I actually a wrote a suicide note, got everything in order and left the house today with no intentions of going back... i actually am so confused sitting in mc ds thinking about best way to do it.. iv drug use is top of list to make it a quick rush of pleasure and end in eturnal slumber.. because why end it being sobor? So to wrap it all back up... chill out, take a step back and think about your anger and if it makes sense and know he loves you. Oh and dont leave him on his bday 2 years in a row to fuck a coworker who called her a hoe and dumb as fuck but still the magic dick power... Idk enjoy your life people. Im checking out soon. Soon as i can man the fuck up and not be such a bitch. Tl;dr loved someone with asburgers(sic?) Who i swear never was caught cause shes a female and pretty sure my life is ruined and will only be misery and me mot being able to mentally take it all and function as an adult now , i also will ruin my daughter by being a shitty dad adding to my depression and final conclusion to just step aside and let life game over and see whats next. And wanted to warn others what little things can turn into."
Please help if you have the time,"Hi, my name is Gavin
I'd like to say I have depression, anxiety, and pretty bad anger issues. Recently my mom has kicked me out of the house and I've had no one to rely on except my grandparents and my cousin, also my girlfriend, Claire. My girlfriend and I are both 19, she is also pregnant. I know It's very early to have a child around such a stressful environment but I really do love this girl and I think If I put my mind to it it'd work out. I ended up moving with my cousin just last night with my girlfriend and we are staying there. Claire and I argued a lot in the past week about trust issues, she had let her ex come over to see her a few times in the past few weeks and I got angry and said a lot of harsh things telling her to get an abortion. I regret everything I've said but It seems she wont forgive me and I get that. I also feel betrayed for her hanging out with her ex while we have a kid on the way. She is only about a month pregnant and we both wanted the kid, we never planned on having one but If I did get her pregnant that we would keep it. After we fought she told me she changed her mind and that she wanted an abortion, this broke my heart. I know I said terrible things because of my anger but that hurt me so much. Along with that she said she no longer loved me and she doesnt think she ever could again. I apologized and tried to fix things because I felt like ending my life more than ever. Two nights ago she said she loved me back and I've never felt more hope or happiness in my life, and then the next day she was hinting towards keeping the kid! and we would move out and find a place to live, it really felt like a new hope. Until today when she posted a few pictures of a concert she went to with her ex on instagram and I reacted poorly because of my anger. I said my horrible things for a solid 5 minutes and she said she would go home, abort the kid, and never talk to me again. I snapped out of my anger and felt guilt, I did it again.. I promised her I would stop being mean. I did agree for therapy and medication but I'm also stressed because of everything else. We are sitting in the same room currently and she is listening to music and making some bracelets. I failed to mention she is also depressed and has DID(a very serious disorder which causes many problems in our relationship sometimes). I do love this girl and I cannot lose her.. But I have accepted that when she does go home and we say our goodbyes I'd like to end it a few weeks after when she forgets who I am. I am ashamed of myself and I don't think I'll ever be the happy person I once was..."
"Lack of energy, will, and motivation.","I cant see my kids, barely talk to them on the phone, not much seeing my family, no women single for 3 years, no job in almost a year, disabled but the state won't believe me. So no food stamps, welfare, disability etc. Barely any friends. I feel like I am in prison spending 20+ hours in a small room in my father's apartment, I cant get my degree (two classes away) until I pay the college like $1500. I am an addict with an eating disorder, insomnia, and depression/anxiety too btw. Nobody quite understands and I am close to calling it quits. I really don't want to wake up tomorrow, I know it will hurt my kids but I barely see them, hurt my parents but they always dismiss my struggles."
Dealing with suicidal thoughts alone,"I have 0 friends, and I'm not exaggerating one bit when I say that. I'm going through a bunch of shit now (have been for a month and its hit its peak), I have stress response syndrome so I cannot cope with anything at all. First off on my list of things, I'm only 19 have agoraphobia and severe anxiety so I can't get a job or go out whatsoever (I barely managed to graduate high school). I have a abusive household that I can't escape cause my agoraphobia and I'm attached. I recently found out a good friend of mine has been manipulating me so I cut them off a few weeks ago. Then I had to cut my best-friend off because they didn't wanna be friends cause my struggles are too much for them, it does't help that they were always hanging out with my ex that I still haven't gotten over. So really it's good (i'd like to think), all the people who have been causing me grief are essentially gone but now I'm alone and fighting to breath by myself, I'm scared and I don't want to be miserable forever. I have a doctors appointment in 2 weeks and I don't know how i'll make it. Sorry this post is a mess, I really need to make friends but its so hard for me."
Feeling off lately,"Hi all,Lurked for a while, not sure why I decided to post. Maybe to vent, i guess?Ive been feeling useless lately, and i dont feel valued, wanted, or needed. I honestly wish i could disappear without causing my wife, family, and few friends any sory of pain. I feel like im never taken seriously, and feel like a living joke. Ive always been the ""funny guy,"" which would explain the lack of being taken serioualy i guess. I feel so trapped in my career, and hatr knowing i have at least 40 more years of work. I know career changes are a thing, but ive found that im not really good at anything, which i guess leads to my low self esteem. Im ok at lots of stuff, but that one thing i excel at is just non existant.I try to be a good husband but i can tell my wife would be happier with someone else, and i honestly cant blame her.Im losing interest in existing, and im losing it fast. Writing all of this out is as helpful as it is scary. Im not sure if these thoughts are normal.Again, not sure what im lookjng to get out of this post. Just to vent, i guess."
I'm the worst part of everyone's life,"I'm reasonably certain my two year old hates me. My dad's an asshole who I don't talk to. My in-laws fucking despise me. I have no friends, I spend all day every day just alone with a toddler. And on top of it all, my husband told me tonight that I'm the reason for his depression. The one person who's supposed to love me for me and I'm fucking destroying his life. At this point, the only reason I'm alive is because I'm pregnant and it's not her fault she's got such a fuck up for a mother. I'm considering suicide, but I'm sure I'll chicken out because I can't even fucking die right. I want a fucking drink, but again, I'm pregnant and I can't do that to her. So basically I'm stuck. And everything fucking sucks. "
I just don't know where to go,"I'm trying SO hard. I'm trying so hard to keep myself together but this is so difficult. I KNOW I have to keep it together. I feel like this is just an endless loop of me struggling, then pretending I'm not struggling, then struggling again. I want to reach a point in my life where I'm at peace but that may take forever and I just don't know if I can do this for much longer."
Im scared of dying but I'm more scared of being alive,im 20 years old and have severe anxiety and depression. It's gotten to the point where I just don't care what happens. I know people would be sad if I died but i just dont care anymore.im just so scared to talk to people but being lonely is really hurting me. im crying just typing this out bc im scared of what people might say to me. i got bullied severely in middle school and it destroyed any confidence i've had. im scared to leave my house bc im worried i will get hurt.  i dont care enough to change anything so i just stay in my room all day and pray to god to give me a sign to stay alive but i never get anything.sorry for this jumbled mess
My only goodbye note.,"Hello, everyone. Recently, I've found it very hard to not think about suicide. I have had depression, sleeping disorders, and many suicidal thoughts for 6 years now. I am now 17, and all I do is sit in my empty room almost every day, no family except a father who is rarely ever here, no pets that would provide any entertainment from the loneliness, nothing. But even if I were to see my family again, I have lost the ability to have a normal conversation, all I do is yell, even if I'm not mad, I just tell them to go away. It's hard to say, but I have felt so down this last week than I have my entire life, and that's saying something because I've attempted before, but right now I have not made any actions, because it's different this time. This time, I've felt so empty and void of feelings, and sometimes even of consciousness, because I would usually just sleep all the time, trying to avoid everything else, but I can't do that anymore. It doesn't work. I don't even have another viable solution to this, as I don't have friends to talk to anymore, since I can't find myself being nice to people as I used to be, and I would like to get rid of myself so that nobody has to worry or care about me anymore. I have no way of getting a job, every time I walk out of my house or see people I hold back major anxiety and pain because of how hard it is to even do that. It's been three years since I've last shed a tear, but what pushed me to the edge and made this painful week start was the realization that I wouldn't amount to anything in adulthood. Actually, I don't even know how long it's been since this started, I lose track of time a lot because I never leave my room, I just sleep or use my worthless computer to make worthless progress on worthless games. I have no one to talk to who would understand, the only people I would talk to would just call the police and get me arrested for it again. I haven't harmed myself in any way for quite a while, but that's not considerably a good thing because back when I was doing that, I wasn't making a plan to end my life or writing a goodbye story. It's so hard to continue about this thinking that nobody I know will ever see it, but all I want before I leave is for someone to read this, and maybe help someone they know suffering before it's too late, like it is too late to help me. I currently don't have a written plan, but I've been thinking of taking a big jump, or hanging, or hopefully finding a gun, but I want to do it, and soon. Very soon. I can't keep waking up at midnight after sleeping for 12 hours and wondering what I'm gonna do all alone today, and how I'm going to handle every waking hour of my life doing it, even though I can't change myself to do something else even though I want to. The only reason I'm not gone right now is because I'm too scared of what the pain I may experience will be like. But I hope I can soon find the most quick and painless way to make it all end, and I'm trying my hardest to find how to do that. EDIT: To add a little bit more before I really leave, For a year now, I've had nobody to rely on. No girlfriend, no family, no friends, nobody to even talk to. It's not like I couldn't go out and get some new friends or date again, but it seems pretty pointless to me now that I can no longer be helped. All people do when you get to know them is cheat on you, or do some fucked up shit behind your back. That's my only experience with other people. Not once have I been able to meet someone and trust them with much. I've also not been able to handle school, let alone going and getting a job. School had always been hell and prison combined for me, and the people in it always sucked too. But anyway, I did find out there is a pretty high train bridge not far from where I live. Hopefully this will work. I might go there tomorrow, maybe in a week, but no longer than that.If you cared enough to read all of this, thank you. And goodbye."
Today was supposed to be the day,"So, I should preface this message by telling you about my Mother. She has this odd obsession with having every window in the house open. She loves to rearrange things, so it should have came as no surprise that I would have come home to a different room. She hadn't done it for a long while though, so I sort of got neglectful at hiding certain things. She had even been leaving my window alone and accepted my preference for a dark room. On Friday I came home to my room well lit and everything was in a different position. At first, I just let it go. If that is what makes my Mom happy then so be it. It wasn't until today that I realized that the things that I had ""hidden"" were gone. My journal was moved and my noose was no where to be found.Now my Mother isn't your traditional loving Mom. She is very awkward and just not cut out for motherhood. She has the inability to show affection or have a meaningful connection with people. My guess is that she has bipolar disorder with a hint of narcissist personality disorder mixed in. Basically, she couldn't give a shit less about her kids.However, she knew that I have been suffering from depression. We never had a talk about it or anything, she just drops me off at my psychiatrist once a month. She hasn't brought up the noose or my journal. She took my blades as well. With all of these things being found, I am in a constant state of panic. She is emotionally abusive and will use this knowledge to try and tear my self confidence down in later arguments. My journal had several passages about her and how she has been nothing but a nuisance in my life. My suicide note is in there as well. There is also a passage about sexual assault that no one in my life knew about. I know that she read it because my pen was moved out of the spiral metal spine. I cannot help but feel angry towards her. She was in the wrong by rearranging my room in the first place, but even more so, she should not have violated my trust by reading the journal. I would have ended my life today had she not taken the only ""tool"" I had. This is how I realized that everything I had hidden had been moved/taken. I couldn't find my damn noose. I refuse to go out by slicing my wrists because the odds of dying aren't great. She had taken my blades anyway, so even if I settled, I would not be able to do it.The rope was perfect and thick and the noose itself was tight. I am now more than ready to abandon this earth as I know what lies ahead will only be worse. I don't have anymore rope and cannot bring myself to jump into the street. No one should be forced to feel guilty about my death so I would never go that route.I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to bring it up to her because like I said earlier, she will just use it as leverage to try and break me down further. She couldn't care less that I have made plans to die and she has made that very clear. I am ready to just walk away from everything. My Mom will never be able to change as she is ill. She will use my death to garner attention and then once that dies down, the thought of her daughter will never cross her mind again. I've come to terms with that.I just need peace. Today was planned out for months and it was ruined by the person who had put in me in that headspace in the first place. I just want death, is that really too much to ask?"
I have lost the will to live,I have nothing all I tell is a tug on my heart I have lost all emotion just fuck this world bye
Some days are livable and the rest are insufferable,"Ya, I hear that. I don't know you so I can only speak from my life. It's not that some days are livable and some are insufferable. It's that they are survivable. I don't live. I survive.
I'm still trying to figure out why I do this. I guess my hope is that if I give it enough time things will change.  eventually. Who knows? Maybe I'll hit the lottery or maybe a buss will hit me. Either way, I win.
Some day the survival instinct will fade, but that's not today.
I'm 52 with not much to look forward to. If you're younger give it time. If you're older then your survival instinct is still strong."
Evreytime I get off the phone with her..,"( can't describe how I feel. It doesn't feel good sometimes and sometimes it doesn't feel bad) we're happy most of the time and we could talk forever a long time. After every phone call my thought are saying I want to kill my self, I want to kill my self , i want to kill my self , kill me, kill me ,  kill me.( I would keep saying those words over and over)Thoughts would last about 30sec or a minute and would feel like a long time. Idk know what's going on."
"I feel guilty about being this sad when I have no reason or right to be, I feel pathetic and worthless- if you aren't busy, please help me","I feel that way too, sometimes "
I�۪m done living,"I�۪m 17 but already fill like I�۪ve had my fill on life. Ever since the fifth grade I�۪ve had this sense of already knowing what�۪s coming next - pain, suffering and, the biggest, people. I have a boring life. Wake up play video games, go to school, come home, masturbate and repeat. Video games don�۪t please me anymore, they�۪re just something I play out of self hate. I try working out but I always end reminding myself that I�۪m not worth the effort. I want to hate myself for wanting to die. But honestly who�۪s gonna remember or miss me. I hate my brother, sister and father. And even if my mom misses me she�۪ll forget soon. The school will probably have a couple moments of silence and maybe a mention at graduation. The few friends I have will forget too. I tried to think of a few reasons to live. But they�۪re inconsequential. Live for the cute girl sitting next to me? Live to keep my family ���happy�۝? Live for a bright future? I�۪m curious too. I�۪m an atheist but I still want to know what comes after death, if there�۪s anything. The sooner I die the sooner people stop talking behind my back. Plus no one really cares about mental health. ���Just pray it away�۝ or ���Get over it�۝. Hell Reddit or someone at school can make a joke about me committing suicide later. I just need the right combination of pills to OD on or a tall tower to jump off of."
My mother is suicidal and I don't know what to do anymore,"God, I really hate myself for posting this because I have never spoken to anyone about this... whatever, here goes.I'm 16, and my mother has always been rather volatile, with severe mood swings and irrational behaviour at times. She's in a pretty terrible relationship with my father, who has anger issues. My dad isn't deliberately cruel or anything - he just loses control of his temper and to be fair, when she's in one of her moods, she goads him and manipulates him. Unfortunately, both have their issues - and neither can or will leave.She recently tried to kill herself. This isn't anything new, but this is the closest I have ever been to losing her. We found her near dead, lacking vital signs, and she was hospitalized for days. She's back and is better, but its getting harder to prevent her from getting her hands on dangerous substances. Every time I hide something that she can use or has used, she finds something else. I don't know what else I can do, or how I can talk to her. How the hell can I explain to her that what's she doing ? That it won't solve any of her problems? She says that when she's gone I can focus better on school and my dad will be less angry. That's untrue. My dad would be broken. We all would be.She keeps telling me how proud she was of how I handled myself when she was hospitalized. I'm now worried that she will be less bothered about killing herself because now she feels I'm mature and responsible enough to be without her.To compound issues, I'm planning on attending university abroad. I have the marks and the stats to get into some great places, but I'm scared that if I go, she'll get worse and I won't be there to prevent something from happening. I still want to go - call me selfish, but I hate dealing with this and I don't want to put my life on hold because of my parents - but the guilt is getting to me. Is there anything I can do to hopefully help her so when I leave, she won't be as bad? I think I'm asking a bit too much there. Thanks for reading anyways. Cheers and have a nice day :)"
Ready to jump off a parking garage.,I'm really depressed sad of living the same day over and over. So sad of keep on crying every night. I just wanna die I just wanna go take a bus trip to a casino and  have one last good night before i jump over. I'm so done. I have nothing to hold me back. I want to die i have nothing to live for.
I just need someone to talk to. Please,"I'm 15, I don't want to die, but it seems like the only option, I have an abusive dad, bad grades, and I've been depressed since I was 11. I really don't want to die, but why keep on living like this?"
Would it be a dick move if I did it on my birthday?,"So my birthday is next Monday. I'll be 27. I have my first counselling session on Wednesday and I'm gonna try to get tested for bipolar. I've already written out my note and I've sort of made a deal with myself that I'm gonna kill myself on my birthday, even if I get told I'm not bipolar. My ex broke up with me recently and I don't wanna spend it alone without her. I think if I am bipolar then it'll be easier for me to do it. I'm also hoping that none of my friends or family wish me happy birthday just so I have the proof I need that no one cares. The only person I want to wish me a happy birthday is her.Am I being a dick if I do it on my birthday?"
I can never have a good day..,"I�۪m abused at home, the online friends I manage to make just bring me bad drama and hurt me, failed attempts of social interactions at school, ex friends that glance at me in the hallways, and my anxiety that makes me look pathetic for a senior in high school.  Honestly. The only thing not making me pull the trigger is my (yes online again because I�۪m pathetic like that) boyfriendI�۪m tied between wishing I was never born and wishing I never met my boyfriend. I love him. But I just feel completely worthless. I stay at home every chance I get, he�۪s the opposite. I�۪m a fucking loser that�۪s just going to drag him down. I don�۪t even want to go to my graduation ceremony. I fucking hate my school and everyone in it. I want nothing else to do with this place. Everyone is fake. Causes drama just because they can. Has no regard for anyone else�۪s feelings. It�۪s a society of morally low minded kids and I want to forget everyone there. I want to start fresh after that."
I'm ending it tonight,"Hi again.I finally gathered the courage to end it for good. I don't see why I should bother going through all the shit people give me every day. I'm so sick of all the pain and anxiety I've been feeling for way too long. I always try so fucking hard to make it through, I try so hard to fix my life, but each time someone just casually comes and fucking destroys it. People either try to avoid me or they shit all over me. I don't even know what's worse anymore. I have no motivation, no will to live because I'm constantly uncomfortable and hurt, and nothing brings me peace. "
Fucking worthless defects like me should paint the walls with their fucking brains!!!,"I shouldn't exist!!! I'm a worthless fucking freak, a defective piece of shit!!! People like me shouldn't exist, and me killing myself would simply be natural selection at work, I should've been smothered or bludgeoned the day I was born. I'm a mistake, a crime against nature, an abomination, and I don't even know why I'm defective, I just know I am, that's why everyone treats me like a monster!"
I haven't posted here in a while,Not because I am better tho. I haven't felt like i have to the words to say to y'all. I don't see a happy ending in my life. I have broken nerves from fibromyalgia. i have a body that causes me so much despair. in my life i get more and more exhausted from every little thing. I never get energy back. Im dragging myself around everyday. I feel like i'm ruining everyone's day by being near them. I spent a while today holding all the meds I hoped to OD on and decided to look it up and see if it is enough. it wasn't. I don't even have an easy escape now... I wrote a poem on how I feel. Why shouldn't she? By Serena [Redacted]She looked in a mirror The horrifying images always reflecting The room echos the bass that harms She doesn't understand why a god made her like some jokeI don't know where to goWhat to even do.I am supposed to live a lifeHappy and like others I'm not like others I'm wrong. That word fits too wellWrong. I'm not worth the effortTo become like themShe glaces down��_ Little chemicals and a bitter drink. Just one bad momentShe will ease the pain of everyone else. Why shouldn't she?I don't see a reason to be worth it. I don't want my own life...
I feel like not taking my medication and sitting in a bathtub until I have a seizure and drown,"I can't get it off my mind I'm so fucking lonely. I want to get off work so badly to come home, and I don't do anything. Everything I enjoyed is just boring. I feel like just getting home, get stoned and go to bed until tomorrow to repeat.It's a never ending circle and who the fuck cares about me nothing would change if I were gone, I doubt anyone would even show up for my funeral, and if they did they probably just felt obligated to go."
Huh. Weird.,Rough day. Weirdly rough. Social anxiety seems to be rearing an ugly head and that's weird cause it's new.
"Back where I was a year ago, cant keep doing this.","Was in the psychiatric floor at the hospital a year ago for a bit less than 2 weeks, my second time there. I felt like it dod me some good and I came out feeling like I coukd handle life, I got a job at Tim Hortons that lasted for something like 4 months but like with every job I've ever had my boredom and depression come back, I dont have much fulfillment in my own life and remaining at 100%  at work gets harder and harder until I just dont show up, it always goes like this, my job history is terrible, I dont know why anyone would hire me.Ive been staying in a house that my mom owned by myself gor the past year, had a horrible relationship with a subsewuent employer, a man who owned a plumbing business, he would threaten not to pay me, send me on jobs claiming I had been with the conpany for years ecen though I had no experience whatsoever, he let me use a work van since I didnt have a vehicle bur also made me pay for work related gas, and we routinely drove 4 or more hours a day, he made constant fat comments, slapped my belly, called me names, threatened to fire me and said a mpnkey2 could do my job among many other instances, one more being the several times I showed up to his hpusw fpr work to have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours off the clock. I ended up quitting thst and havent found something else, my mom is downright sociopathic but I'll tall about that more if people want to, she constantly makes things up, says family members she wont name are talking about me, telling her she should cut off contact with me, she and her new husbamd call me a manipulator, and Im just finding it hard get back on my feet, I need to reeaply for medicare, Im gping to be homeless soon, theres all this stuff coming down on me, phone bill to be paid, I just want to kill mtself, If anyone wants to talk I'd appreciate it."
"In a bad place right now, urge to self harm growing","I'm having another mental attack, I always get one a couple of times a year and they last a few days. I have no friends and no one to talk to.

Empty inside,While since I posted but I'm doing better. Not as depressed as I was before but I still feel that emptiness feeling inside. I still think bout my ex and motivation isn't there still. Idk I guess need more time . I'm trying to meet females but it seems to end in disappointment. Maybe it's not meant to be for me . Friend of mine keeps on telling me to grow thicker skin . I just can't be that way and this is how I am . Emotional to much and I get token advantage of cause of that . Also she told me I have no ambition and to laid back . She is right and I feel so shitty . Weak and worthless. Maybe that's why I can't keep a woman cause I'm not ambitious enough. Fucking hate it and myself. I still have thoughts of suicide but I wouldn't have the courage to go through with it .  I'm so afraid of getting hurt again and I don't think I can take another disappointment
life is boring,"first there's indoctrination, memorizing pointless information and spitting it back out, not understanding why. You're then left at an awkward stage after school not knowing what the point of anything is so you get a job so you can live on your own. maybe you meet someone along the way who does the same. after 45 years of suffering, at your dead end job that didn't go anywhere, you decide to retire with the little money you both have saved and are finally able to rest without worrying about tomorrow. after 10 more years you die not knowing what any of life was for, questioning why you put up with so many problems, and why you pretended to care for so long and why you didn't just end it when you knew it was going to be like this at 13. "
I hate myself,Texted my ex of 2 years ago today. Everything is adding up. I moved across the country for a good job and I'm still laying in bed at night wishing I could blow my fucking brains out.
Relieved to be able to say how much I want to die.,"Anywhere, even anonymously. Even mentioning in normal life that I don't feel my life has purpose or meaning gets me pity and pep talks at best, and not terribly subtle hints to stop the conversation or withdrawal from friendships at worst. And while I don't know for sure what saying offline that I want to die (and in fact have multiple plans with multiple pro and con lists in my head) would get me, I'm pretty sure it would involve a two-way ticket to the psych ward along with all the negative impacts on the life I would have to go directly back to afterward that that would entail.I'm mid-30's, female, childless, single. Just got dumped in a really ugly and protracted way by someone I should have known better than to mess with in the first place, actually. I'm not close to my own family, who were abusive and/or nonsupportive, but haven't completely cut ties with them either. I have friends, but friends in your 30's are not what friends in your 20's and earlier are, and most if not all have priorities which come (and legitimately should come) far above a seemingly pretty stable if not entirely happy friend. Hell, even above an unstable friend. I was seeing a therapist for a long time. She was very kind but ultimately not that helpful, but that is not my point. I mention her to say that anytime I would mention how much I felt I was lacking due to not having a family, she would push the idea that I could have friends who were ""like"" family, no matter how much I would say that wasn't what I wanted.The thing is, I don't really believe in that. I wouldn't say it is fake, but I would say it is a simile rather than a literal truth. ""Like"" family. But not really family. The degree of permanency, loyalty, even a certain amount of closeness is not the same. Yes, I could get myself some invites to some awkward, third-wheel Thanksgivings. Even have, in the past, though many of those ""like family"" friends have since drifted away, proving my point all too well. But for what?The thing is, I want the real thing. I feel so awfully unlovable... and then, the greatest mindfuck of all is how much I feel there is something wrong with me for feeling that and typing that, even totally anonymously.I also feel very ungrateful. I have a solidly OK job and career path. Not great, but solidly OK. I pay the bills. I'm enrolled in a graduate program, part-time. I have a safe, affordable place to live, even if I simultaneously feel very trapped there and it is less than ideal in a number of ways. I have pets. I have the aforementioned friends. And I barely have the focus, will and energy to keep it all barely together in all these domains despite all the many responsibilities I don't have that most people do at my stage of life. But still, I feel ungrateful for not wanting this life, and even seriously considering ending it on a regular basis, when others have it so much worse and my life is by all objective standards a fortunate one."
I dont feel alive?,"Im not suicidal and im not depressed. however, ive been thinking about my future and whether its worth it. i still study, hang out with friends, etc, and i would feel like ���myself�۝, but when im stuck doing hw or something late at night, the thought of death doesnt intimidate me. like i always have this thought ���everyone dies. its just a matter of when u die.unless ur steve jobs or abe lincoln, a majority of things u did wont matter after death�۝. this leads me to believe that theres no point in trying to make a difference in the world bcuz ill die in a couple of decades (unless im steve jobs or something). i have goals, family and friends, and im in a decent situation (my social life at school could be alot better and i would appreciate less hw and tests).just a little rant. im really bored and stuck doing hw.

Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria is killing me and I'd rather die than live with it.,"I have rather severe ADHD, which comes with a heaping dose of . It is defined as  I take everything personally. I hate seeing other people happy. I constantly worry about things I have no control over. It's so hard to tell people about this because I'm constantly fighting through misconceptions about ADHD. Yeah, sure, it's hard for me to focus and I always sway back and forth like I have to pee. But it's impossible for me to function as a human being emotionally too. But I always get either I'm ""making it up"" or ""we all have a little ADHD"". I'm just so fucking tired of it.When my meds are working, I don't have to worry anymore. I can talk to people. I focus on the things I can control. I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. But it never lasts. Adderall gave me mood swings. I developed a tolerance for Ritalin. Concerta requires 3 hours of exercise for it to activate. And I was making do with that for the time being, even if it doesn't leave me a lot of time to do homework. But now, even with the exercise, it's not working anymore. I'm already at the max 72mg for Concerta. I don't really see any other options.  And I'd rather kill myself than live with it. Hopefully, this time, I don't fuck up."
Which is the easiest way to die?,"I am not sure if this is the right place. I've read this subreddit for years and never commented once. There have been stories that made me hopeful and I carried on. Now, I'm unable to cope with life. I need this to end. I'm sorry. "
i can no longer go on.,"I can no longer take anymore criticism from my mother. I can no longer hear another word of how useless i am every single day. I can longer live with her comparing me to others. I can no longer stand my father ignoring me. I can no longer stand the tone of voice when my father replying anything I was saying like I am an eyesore. I can longer tell myself to stay alive for my family. I can no longer believe there is another way out. I can no longer seeing my friends leave my side one by one. I can no longer imagine life if I ever find a job and move on. I can no longer imagine life getting better. I can no longer say I love myself. I can no longer trust any professional counseller, psychiatrist, nor psychologist which i met all three that judged me and given me and my condition a name within 3 minutes of meeting me, without me telling them anything, everyone was in it for the money. There is no more hope. I am just waiting for someone to tell me to die so I can finally do it.
I have been imagining hanging myself and stabbing myself a lot more frequent. I used to think of ways of killing myself with lesser pain, but I no longer do, as long as it kills me, I don't think I would mind the pain. I don't know what and why I'm asking.
I have seen people who claim to want to help only to be leaving sooner then I expected. I want a reset, but I know there isnt and wont be one."
It happened today.,"I have not felt this feeling in a long time. I have not thought about suicide in a very long time. Today, that thought popped into my head and quite frankly scared the living shit out of me. A few years ago, I was ready. I had it all planned out. Letter's written. Everything. My parents were on vacation. I had stayed home because I had band rehearsals mid summer for the upcoming season. I'm not sure why, but one of my dearest friends showed up at my house to watch our favorite musical. (Phantom of the Opera) Her arrival was not planned or expected. She ended up spending the night and we stayed up all night and just talked. If it was not for her, I would not be here today. I have never told her this and probably never will. She is in my life today and that is all I'm worried about. Fast forward to today. I have been going through a lot lately. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress. Anxiety has been extremely high. I've been feeling very very alone lately. I live in a city where my closest family member is over an hour away. My boyfriend just left me. I work with what feels like 24/7. I have absolutely no friends that I can turn too.. and I thought to myself, ""no one gives a shit about you. If you were to disappear, no one is going to notice."" I cried for hours and I am not feeling ""okay"" right now. Any positive, helpful thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated though the next few days. I'm finding it very difficult to pick up the pieces right now. "
I'm so unattractive it makes me want to die.,"I've never once seen myself as attractive, and I've never had a girlfriend because of it. I have the weakest jawline and my nose outweighs my forehead as well. I felt like if I got plastic surgery I'd be judged for not loving myself enough. I've thought about ending my life before, I've felt that if I did it would somewhat be better anyways, because of my unattractive mess of a person I am anyways. "
I am literally unable to stop thinking about it,"Suicide. I CAN NOT stop thinking about it. Ways to do it, how it would feel, the relief of finally having some blood pump through my veins right before I hit the ground. I'm so bored and unhappy with my life that the act of ending it would be the only thing to provide sufficient excitement. I'm depressed and have been since 17. The fact is I don't feel anything at all except empty boredom. I'm on autopilot and want to die. I don't even know if I'd consider myself unhappy. Happy and sad are emotions and I am completely void of emotion.Found this subreddit after weeks of obsessing over it.I think I'll flip a coin."
I've decided I'm going to do it tonight. Need someone to talk to.,"I have enough of this shit. I'm doing it tonight. There's no one that can talk me out of it. I'm so afraid for my family and what they will go through, so I'm going to cover everything in my note. I'm going to say I asked for forgiveness for my religious mother's sake. I'm going to apologize to my father for being such a waste of time and money. I don't know what I'll say to my brother and sister. I'm just so sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't be better. I'm sorry that I couldn't be stronger. This is the liberation I need right now. People mean the best but all I can do is throw it back in their faces. I'm so sorry."
Lost my sense of self preservation,"It's weird - I suddenly just don't give a fuck anymore. I don't think I care much if I don't graduate or if I don't go to college or if I get expelled or if I hurt the people I love and that love me. Nothing really matters to me anymore - I don't have goals or anything to really work towards, and I don't want anything. I'm about to get a zero for this project and so is my partner if I don't go to school today. And strangely enough, fuck it, I don't think I'm going. I'm a horrible being, and I wouldn't mind being erased. I'm on an anti-depressant and a mood stabilizer and now I just want to overdose. What do I do now? "
"Dead end job, losing hope, mental health dwindling.","Hello,
I have entertained the idea briefly years back. My mother has been very sick for sometime and I don't think I can hold on any longer. The thoughts are beginning to make their way into my life in lots of different ways. I've been convincing myself that the easiest option is death. Do you have any advice for changing my patterns of thinking over the long term? CBT with a therapist and medication have been consistent for years. "
My mind is a mobile prison,"I can never seem to get away from it. I'm constantlyon edge, worrying that I'm going to make some split second decision to stop the pain, stop the longing. I'm haunted by memories of a life I don't get to live anymore, full of happiness and hope. The same memories that helped me fall asleep at night keep me wide awake in pain or fear. Everywhere I go, everything I see has some memory trigger that reminds me ""You used to be happy. You used to have hope. You used to have purpose. You used to care for people."" Anything I try to do is like a quick high, it only lasts for a matter of minutes before it dies. Death may not be the best solution, but it is a way to get out of the hell hole that is my mind. "
"18, i don't see a future","where do i start? just graduated from high school and i have over 9 months to study for some tests to get in to a university. i want to be a english teacher (in Turkey) but i don't want it i just feel like thats the only thing i can do. I hated school, i hated classes, i hated students and i hated teachers. Don't get me wrong i got lot to tell. You see during this period of time that i have i want to study. maybe go to a gym as well. that's not how my parents think, they want me to work while i study . me? working? now? having a 1 minute conversation feels like getting chased by 50 murderers to me. I got no social skill and unsurprisingly i got no friends, none. I can't work, not now. i have terrible cardio, walking for 5 minutes is a torture to me. How the fuck i am going to work? They don't want me to work so i can bring some cash to the house thats not reason. They want to convince people that i am normal. Every motherfucker that comes the home talks about why i should work and get some ""experience "" I've been the kid that everyone shit on. Because i am not so smooth at talking and i don't go out much everyone talks about how weird i am. Like thats my fucking fault, like i raised myself for fucks sake. Also i am 18 and im tall and i got beard which basically means that i am completely 100% ready to start living. No one asks or even wonders what the fuck going in my head. Going trough all this alone is really tough, i feel like if i had person in my life that would care about me i can overcome everything but i just don't. I am alone there is no way that i will find someone like that. I just know i will fail at everything, i will never be able tell people how i feel. From now on i am going down and that's how it's going to be. When i used to think about my future i would see a nice girl, my dream job professional wrestling and good friends. now i just see a grave. Only thing i can think about is just how and when i am going to end this."
Meh.,"Just turned in a bunch of assignments for school.  Several of them late. A lot of easy bullshit like sample resumes.  I don't know, it's all self reflection garbage. My life is nothing but mistakes. I hate it, I hate everything I've done. I hate myself. I just dream for the day I finally kill myself."

Im all alone in this evil, hatred filled and despicable world.. I hope someone would just place the gun on my head, and finish me. That way i wouldnt have the guilt of causing the single or two people that cared grief (thats if anyone actually does). Im already dead from the inside. Im just a lifeless body waiting to rot. Im just a fallen leaf. Waiting to be crushed, or waiting to slowly fade away into the abyss.Who am i kidding. Im all alone, noone will care, noone will bother to read this. I should just stop fucking lying to myself. I should just place the ice cold barrel on my head...... And do it. "
Accepting my Fate,"So.. I think I�۪ve been depressed for 3 years now and this summer has been the worst. I finally found my happiness but, she wanted to go separate ways. Being alone is something to get used to and definitely hard. My sister and her were bffs and now the bond has been broke. I think I�۪m going to accept my fate by fixing what I broke up and then ending everything because I don�۪t see a point of living anymore. "
Spiraling Down,"I�۪m so sad that it hurts my head. I�۪m broken. I�۪ve never been able to connect with anyone. Wife of 17 years says she regrets meeting me and I�۪m her biggest mistake. This is consistent theme in our marriage. My three daughters are so perfect, if I stay in their lives I�۪ll break them too.I was abandoned by my mother at 10 and I never recovered - I never will. I will never be able to give my wife the connection she deserves and my girls the father they need. I�۪m broken and I don�۪t see a way out.I tried to be strong but I want to quit everything and sleep. My only solace is being unconscious. I crave escape and sleep. Death can�۪t be that different. I know it�۪s not politically correct, but is it such a bad thing to extinguish a single spark from a roaring fire? I have no significance on a cosmic, planetary or even municipal scale. I can�۪t think of a reason to stay. Everyone will say ���stay for the girls - they need you�۝. But if I�۪m being honest, they need a much better father figure than what I�۪ve offered or can offer. I am broken and I just want to sleep."
What�۪s the point anymore,What happened?
my relationship with my mom.,"I'd rather not be in a situation where everything i say is taken as a joke. as some sort of pun. As if im trying to make you laugh by telling you about my issues. as if you somehow deserve my trust after you laugh when i told you that <i> i was molested </i> by a man you brought into the house and laughed with and drank with and brought around other small children and when you laughed when i told you i was suicidal but then cried when i cut - as if i hadnt told you i wasnt okay. you tell me im making you sad that its my fault youve gotten worse, as if im the one in the bad because im doing this to spite you. to make you feel bad. i tell you i don't feel okay but you only listen when im lying on my deathbed. I tell you i cant feel my hands but you only listen when i can't feel your touch. i tell you i can't see but you only listen when my eyes roll on the floor. You want my help when im dying and i want yours when youre thriving, but only one of us gets what we want. and that someone isnt me."
Why do treat you like shit when trying to commit suicide?,"Edit: I meant to say why do PEOPLE. ....I understand that most humans are angered at the idea of someone close decided to take their life away. But when you're aware of how much joy you give to those by helping them out with their problems and ask for no reciprocation you can't stop but to ask yourself, ""why the fuck are they treating me like shit?""
I've been institutionalize for suicide as a teen because my significant other preformed fellatio to a friend in front of me but ive never tried again ever since. I have a ton of friends and  I always put a smile upon them and it makes me happy. It truly does. But I'm depressed and sometimes can't stop to think to dissappear. No one's really reached out to me except one girlfriend. But she overdosed on heroin so she's out of the picture. I have a gf now but every time I tell her about something she has little to say or doesn't know what to say. She makes me laugh and all but doesn't get me truly. I do think about suicide from time to time but if I were to attempt again and fail I'm sure I would get so much hate.
Im not asking for help. I just wanted to vent."
Ready to try again,"Bought some rope today. Not sure when I'll quit messing around and just do it already. Attempted to OD back in March, but that didn't work, obviously.I tried to get my foot into therapy, but my work schedule clashed with their availability, and now I'm about to lose my insurance.Can't talk to my family about these problems. My sisters think I'm useless and already tell me I should just die sometimes. I have so many trust issues with my mother. (Snooping through my belongings, reading my diary, opening my mail, etc) The relevant one in this situation is the fact she made jokes about my most recent attempt, instead of trying to help.It's weak stuff to die over probably, but I'm pathetic and over being a burden on so many others."
Suicide,"I want to kill myself. I find myself very envious of my dead friends. I think of myself as a survivor and know I sound like a pussy. But, I just don't really understand what I'm doing anymore. I've been struggling with the loss of my significant other. We dated for ten years on and off and my life with him was the only normal life I've known. I've been through not one but several traumatic experiences which I've never received help for. And there's also a lot of pressure I'm dealing with in terms of success. I'm trapped in a job that I hate which earns me a great deal of money. However, my mom depends on me so I can't quit or get a normal job. I've never attempted suicide even though I've always thought about it. The problem is that Ive been thinking about it more and more frequently over the last year. I cry almost every day, I think about it everyday. I know there are people in worse situations. But are they just better equipped for those situations? I don't know. I just know how I feel."
I have everything going for me.,"I have a good job, a loving wife, financial stability...yet I am so sad. I remember being suicidal even in third grade. Walking down the playground in the winter with my head down 'cause I was teased and felt worthless. Things never got better until maybe the end of high school.I developed a problem with alcohol which I still deal with, and my job sucks. I really want to jump off a bridge. I won't do it now, but I feel like I will someday. I don't know when. It could be tomorrow, it could be five years from now. But god, I don't understand why I feel so shitty. I mean, I guess I could think of a million reasons, related mostly to my mother, but that was twenty years ago. I should be over it now. But right now, I am crying, drinking and just want to be numb.Thanks for reading."
Please help me,"I feel alone and no one cares. My family hates me, my friends aren't there for me, and even my dog doesn't like me. I can disappear and everything will resume as normal within a couple days. There's no point in staying when I have nothing keeping me here. Does anyone have any reason to stay?"
Extremely overwhelmed,"I don't think I am brave enough to actually try suicide because I can't abandon my pets, but I wish something would just make the pain stop.My mom's dog died today from a tumor and while he wasn't my dog directly, I took care of him as a puppy when I lived with my mom and always paid attention to him throughout the years when I would visit. He was 11 yrs old and just entered his senior years (he was a chihuahua and small dogs age the same as cats making him 60 yrs old in human yrs). I'm not a big dog person but I care about all animals in general and I cared about him a lot. My mom is extremely self-centered and only thinks of herself. I have a cat she bought around the same time as Paco. She said she wanted the cat back but couldn't cause her place only allows 1 pet per apt. So now that Paco has died I thought she might take the cat back and now she doesn't want her and has completely abandoned her despite the fact of knowing that I cannot afford 2 cats. Then I saw on fb that she wants a pug now. Paco's body isnt even cold for 12 hrs and she's already looking for another. The narcissistic bitch. She never asked me if I was ok with the death and I am the reason he went to the vet in the 1st place cause she was whining about the cost so I threatened to report her for neglect cause the poor dog couldnt even walk anymore.On top of all of that, most of my friends treat me like shit but tell me how nice of a person I am. My 1 friend had a kid in Jan and hasn't even invited me to meet her baby nor has she talked to me since despite me trying to talk to her. Yet she randomly posts happy birthday on my fb wall to make herself look good. I supported her through everything even though I was going through heartache and after 20 yrs of friendship she treats me like she is much more superior than I am just cause she has a husband & a baby and I am all alone.I just cant go through this pain anymore. I dont know what to do and I am literally stuck in my situation cause I have ptsd that cripples me from doing much. Even when I try I still need help and my mom bitches nonstop. I am 32 yrs old and I am screamed at almost every single day by her. I cant even go without answering my phone for a day without her flipping out on me. I do have a mental health team but my insurance cut back the hrs so I only get to see her every 2 weeks. They put me on watch a few weeks ago and my sw called my mom to tell her to be gentle with me and stuff. My mom hears Im suicidal and talks to my sw about a book she wrote and if I had told her about it.Other than being here for my 2 cars and hamster. I have nothing else."
My biggest regret,"A little over 2 weeks ago, I was inches from ending my life. I had my poison drink in my hand, wrote my goodbye letter, but couldn't build up the courage to drink it.Later that week, I admitted myself to a physchiatric (sp?) rehabilitation center thinking that would help. I wasn't considered a serious case so I was released in 55 hours.Something to work on was to communicate my feelings more to trustworthy people. I've since had in depth conversations with my closest friends. This has backfired. I have felt more alone than ever. I feel like they're avoiding me at all costs.My biggest regret is not swalling the drink when I had the chance. Here Im sitting contemplating my choices. My closest friends don't seem. Like they'll miss me. We all had talks in my signs of hitting rock bottom and how to help. I've been showing those signs, only to be given the cold shoulder time after time.At some point, I just have to be selfish and do what's best for me. "
Last note..,"I am 18.. and I will commit suicide today, 26th of September~ My story you want to hear? Simple, I am getting abused my family us abusing me, my classmates is making fun of me. before I die I wanted to tell you this guys, don't trust people you don't know, they are cruel one of them pretended to be my friend what did I get ? I got stabbed with a knife on my chest. I tried everything I had a bad past with drugs.. my boyfriend knows of'et and he thinks that I am all right.nothing is going as I wished, I just wanted to smile for once in my life after 5 years of depression I came to the point wher I will say goodbye.You may think this is not a reason? Ive been abused so often in any way, none can imagine.I will take my life by cutting my wrist open and taking sleeping pills.
My boyfriend... I love you so much I just wanted to thank all of you reading this and
I love you, I never meant to make you sad..."
Honestly: bleh,"I'll not write another post lying to myself. I'll never have the guts to actually commit suicide. I'll just do what everyone does, you know, wake up, work and go to sleep until I eventually die."
Lost,I feel like the only way out is to get out of life. I can't keep going this way. My family deserves better and I don't know what to do
Brain injury,"I am 33. Male.
I sustained a brain injury in the army about ten or fifteen years ago.
I have cluster headaches
The pain is indescribable, random onset and duration.
Light and sound make it worse.
I have two children.  Their mother got married a couple months ago and moved them 1200 miles away.
My father and three grandparents have gambling problems,  my sisters have drug problems.  I have been getting a check for years and have nothing to show for it. They take advantage of my brain injury and I lose alot of money.
I can not go out to meet people. I haven't gotten laid in 5 years. I can't even get family to go out with me,  let alone a woman. The few times I had an option the crap my ex has put me thru makes me hesitate,  and she loses interest.
There is no medication I can take to help with the pain. Antidepressants don't work.
I get angry at all of this but have no one to blame,  I pace and go for a walk and now I take the shotgun out and put in my mouth and imagine if there is any reason not to pull the trigger,  sometimes I pray to god to ignite the round. I stop for my sons,  but they are gone and I have nothing left now nothing to live for.  There is no hope.  No karma.  This world is hell. "
Hello,"Hello I am a 32 year old man from the U.K. I am just posting here on the off chance I might get some advice or, well I don't know really I suppose there is nowhere else I can really say any of this. I have called Samaritans many times but it never really changes anything and I always feel like I am having the same conversation.
So basically I am 32, at home with mum and dad, university drop-out, cannabis addict, fired from every job I have ever had except one (I have had around 20 jobs) girlfriend left me around 7 years ago been single since then. Have been trying to get mental health help from the NHS for the past 3 years and all I have discovered from my appointments with several people during that time is that I don't have ADHD and I am not a danger to anyone.
Long term mental health care is impossible to find if you can't afford to pay, the Tinder culture has ruined my chances of ever being in a relationship, my career prospects are zero, I have no friends and spend every night at home on the PC either playing video games or watching pointless youtube videos until I fall asleep. My parents have made it clear they can not afford to finance my living at home but they will continue to try until I am able to ""sort myself out"" which is a possibility I really have no belief in. The only thing stopping me is the fear of a painful death or of something going wrong and having to live with a permanent injury.
I suppose I thought maybe talking to some like minded people might make the long nights a little easier to manage. Thanks and best wishes to you all. "
I am exhausted.,"There's nothing left for me here. Sometimes, for a moment, I'll get sad thinking about the wedding I won't have and the animals I won't get to save, but I'm just too tired to care that much. I either feel nothing, or intense, overwhelming despair and that's it. The hot and cold is sucking the life out of me and I don't know if I can stick around much longer.
It's impossible to tell when it'll really be it for me. I feel like it'll happen with the car somehow, or maybe I'll OD. Jumping off a cliff is also plausible. I just don't want it to be messy, I'll feel to bad for whoever finds me. "
I'm so worthless,"Everyone around me is so successful. Everyone around me is loved. Me? Things I can do, I'm not great at. No one truly loves me. I feel so alone. I feel like my existence is so worthless."
Lost in the World,"So I think I'm going to finally kill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts since middle school which I've been able to suppress, but I think I'm going to act on these thoughts soon. I'm almost 27 now and I got nothing to show for it. My life has been failure after failure. I'm a college dropout, havent had a girlfriend in years, have no savings, I work a dead end job, I've gained 100 pounds just in this year alone, my meds don't work, therapy hasnt worked either. I thought things were going to get better. I left my old job back in April and did a partial hospitalization program for 2 months, but that ended too soon. The only thing it did was leave me unemployed and uninsured. Sure I learned some shitty coping skills but thats not going to fix my life. I got no idea how to fix my life or where to start. I honestly don't know what I want out of life. I feel so fucking lost. I hate the idea that I need to find a job and save money and buy a house and buy a car and have a family. Whats the point of any of it. I've looked for jobs and I've researched them and I have no idea what I want to do or where I want to go. I just don't believe any job will give me joy. Sure I like the idea of going back to school and doing things right this time, but I got no idea what I would go back for. Nothing interests me.The popular thing on reddit is to tell people to learn a trade. Well I'm so out of shape now, I don't think my body can handle it. Instead I'm biding my time working retail making 10.75 an hour which isnt even enough to pay a car payment. I just don't care anymore I don't feel attached to it or anything. I could go on and on, but I doubt anyone really cares. The fact is that I'm going to die and the world will move on and no one will remember me.I've been told if I start to feel like this I should go to a hospital, but I don't have insurance anymore, I can't afford it and they probably wouldnt keep me. I just feel like I'm having a full breakdown. It feels like the world is just passing me by and I'm just a spectator who's lost in it. "
Confused.,"I have suicidal thoughts often, but they're not what seems to be usual ""suicidal thoughts"" I have severe depression/anxiety, and most of the time (sometimes I do have instances where I want to actually die) I want to attempt suicide and fail just so that I can show people that I'm really struggling, that I need help. Right now my parents aren't big on therapy or anything so idk, I feel selfish or like an attention seeker. Maybe I am an attention seeker, I just feel like I need help"
Cliff or train,Which one would you choose. I can get to a cliff which is a 200 foot drop. Train station where high speed trains go through every morning.
Tired of everything,"I�۪m 18 years old and dealing with depression, social anxiety, still living with my parents because I have no money.My mother, who clearly sees it, making everything worse on purpose. It all started when she called me a hamster (when I was looking to the mirror). I said that I�۪m not a hamster and she started to laugh. Then I said that she looks like a hamster herself, but the replied that she�۪s  looking better looking than that (basically she told me that I�۪m uglier than her). I�۪m not a smart person. I have a hard time doing my homework/school work. I�۪m not good at math, science etc. The other day, after I got home, she told me that I�۪m completely stupid and couldn�۪t pass any exam without her and  private tutor�۪s help, that I should have ended up in vocational education school than gymnasium (she said that I�۪m not worth studying here, that there�۪s somebody better than me who should study here instead). She told me that I am worthless and that I don�۪t have a future, and can�۪t do anything on my own, she thinks of me as a person who has a learning disability. It really hit me. I know that I�۪m not a genius and I easily get bored at school, because of that I get bad grades, but that doesn�۪t mean she can put me down like this. ���You�۪re childish, can�۪t manage your time effectively, can�۪t do anything on time, you�۪re like a child, when will you become less stupid, look, your cousins are even better than you, they get good grades at school and deserve more than you, you will never be smart like them, because you�۪re worse than average �۝.When I try to lose weight, she buys food that I love to eat and then tells me that I�۪m spoilt and not grateful for everything that she does for me. She says that I�۪m nothing without her, that everything about me is shit, that my taste in everything is also shit.I hate how she treats me like a child, calls 10 times a day, I don�۪t need her help. I just want her to disappear. She always asks how I do at school, drags out every little detail about my life and then she uses that information against me to put me down, or when I achieve something, she tells, ���You could have done that way better�۝. She never tells me anything about herself.I can�۪t believe that she is my mother. I mean, she should support me or at least accept me for who I am. I�۪m so tired of this. When the only enemy is the person who�۪s my mother.
What should I do? Should I ignore her? The only solution I see is to kill myself. I don�۪t deserve to be here, I�۪m just flesh who�۪s getting I the way, useless human being, who's not talented, not a genius, not even attractive."
Considering writing a note.,But just a note. I don�۪t plan on actually killing myself. I�۪m just curious what a note would look like. If it would make sense. To see all of my issues down on paper. Does any of that make sense?
theres no reason for me to live,"using a throwaway. Like I said theres no reason for me to live. I am completely alone. I'm an idiot who's failing my class and I missed one this morning because I overslept. I can never do anything right and always seem to mess everything up. I have no friends the people who I used to be friends with never respond to my texts or ever text me. I dont have a family that gives a shit about me. I go home and get told to kill myself. So why not indulge them. I've been bullied my entire life with people making fun of my voice and everything else they can think of. My anxiety and depression and intrusive thought are just too much for me to handle anymore. I don't see any way this could get better. There is no other option for me anymore. I'm a loser and an idiot I would be doing the world a favor by killing myself. It's the #1 request I get from people every single day. So I might as well. I have a plan and a date set. I just wanted somewhere to vent for a minute. Sorry about the shit formatting, I can't think straight at the moment."
Not sure if this is really worth my time to write out and anyone else�۪s time to read...,"I plan to end everything by this weekend. I�۪ve had a few people try to convince me otherwise, but of course, as you can tell by this post - it�۪s not worked. I�۪m a financial burden on my parents (whom I still live with at 21). I�۪m in credit card debt (shouldn�۪t complain - that�۪s my own fault). I hate everything about myself - how I look, how I think about things, my weirdness...Some people say I�۪m wrong, but it�۪s extremely hard to believe otherwise - I�۪m not worth anyone�۪s time... I�۪m a waste of space, air, and just everything. Regardless of what anyone says, I AM and everyone else is better off with me not being here. That�۪s just how it is. As much as I�۪d rather not die in pain, I know I deserve it."
"Too afraid to commit suicide yet I want too, and no one cares if I contemplate and/or actually commit it","I have tried posting in a bunch of different subreddits about my problems, in hopes of someone actually bothering with me, and all I get is zero comments and my posts get zero attention.  I'm sick of living, yet I'm scared to death of dying. When I see people having a good time together, I get angry and sad, because I have nobody, I never had friends at all, no real relationships. I'm always tired too. I am a below average person with a dead end future of crap, can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed living.I probably sound whiny, but I never have anyone to talk to. I'm sick of being ignored IRL and on the damn internet. Where's the people who actually care? Nowhere. I feel as if I opened up to people, they'd laugh at me or be condescending.This post will be buried under more important suicidal posts, but I just wanted to write my thoughts. "
Slitting wrists hypothetical question.,"If someone is alone at night and no one will disturb him, can he successfully slit wrists? I know how to do it and I'm seriously not asking for help or something lol. This is a hypothetical question. Can't someone bleed to death for 9-10 hours if cutting is done correctly?"
My Girlfriend is suicidal.,"I love her with all my heart. She is constantly depressed but goes through periods of almost normalcy before sinking into depressive episodes. She constantly says she /needs/ to go and that she wants to go, that she is ruining my life by holding me back etc. (It isn't true however.) I love her very much and I never have any idea how to help; I've read the sidebar links and she hates counselling and will never go not even with me and she is firmly against using meds saying she would rather die than use them"
My bf says he wants to die...,"He's been depressed since I've met him (2 years), but I didn't think he was at this point. He's angry all the time, and very irrational. Yesterday he dropped a bomb on me-he just wants to die. Nothing makes him happy, and the only emotion he can really feel is anger. He also thinks he's too messed up for help. That he can't be ""fixed"". How do I convince him that he can get help, and he won't feel like this forever? He says paying money to talk to someone is stupid, and that he's tried a few different anti-depressants before, and they all made him horribly sick. I don't want to lose him. What do I do??"
I�۪ve had an ongoing battle with depression for a long time. And I think about death a lot.,But I also have a few people who truly love me. And I won�۪t let this beat me. Because that�۪s the cowards way out. I can overcome! I will not let this own my life. The sun has already risen and I�۪m still here!
I need help getting though today,I am having severe physical pain (on-going chronic illness that doctors can't fix) and horrible depression and just don't want to be alive anymore. I'm struggling to find housing so I don't have to stay with my abusive spouse anymore but was told it would be 6 months to a year to get housing assistance. I'm unable to work because of physical disabilities so I have no income & about 40K in debt.
Hate,"I just hate my self so much I can't take it. My whole body is hurting so much because I'm tensing up completely and have uncontrollable spasms the whole time. There is a huge urge to gag I can barely think straight and all I want is to stay up, go out, get a clear thoughts and simply walk to the scaffolding, climb up and let myself fall down. That's the only thing I can catch a clear thought onto right now. And I'm alone, nobody is there, everyone is asleep busy or ignoring me although I anyways don't really have people to talk to. I'm done"
Nothing ever changes,"I'm going to kill myself because I am fed up of surviving for no reason, there's nothing I enjoy,  I've never really enjoyed anything. I am a boring person that no one wants around, which is why over the last ten years I've steadily lost any hope that things will ever get better. Doctors can't do anything, not even sure they're that good at dealing with this for anyone. I've spent the last of my savings on a trip which I knew wouldn't make me feel better, but I did it anyway because what else can I do. There's no reason to go home and no reason to stay here, can't really anyway. Just got to work up the courage to do what I've known is the best solution for me since I was 10."
Just can't keep building myself up then dropping down and feeling like this,"Hey all, anyone else tired of motivating themselves, feeling like you've finally learnt to overcome this thing and are ready to move forward in life but then something happens and you are back having these thoughts?Yeh well I was having a lot of anxiety as a kid but it's when I hit 20 and started balding that's when it really began. And there has been on and off peaks were it's crippled me from leaving my room.Something so stupid as hair which I have tried drugs to bring my hopes up then didn't work. Tried seeing a therapist for a year feeling really good, dropped lots of addictions like gaming and porn and finally ready to move on with life - but now I am on exchange and these thoughts ave returned. I even got this SMP procedure but I still have a way of thinking about my head ... it's like I just don't want to let go of this pain.And it feels like I will never let go so what's the point, right? My personal fixation is with hair but can anyone else feel the same with building/improving yourself then falling back down to square 1 and feels like you start again?"
"What would happen if, while in therapy, I express suicidal ideation AND reveal that I have access to a firearm at home? Could I be committed?","This doesn't exactly feel like the correct subreddit for this but I figured some people here would have first hand experience. I live in California. I've been in therapy with a LCSW for a short period of time now. My suicidal ideation is sometimes discussed but I have not been open about the fact that I do have access to a gun in my home (it belongs to a family member and is unsecured thus accessible to me). This is really eating at me because suicidal ideation is something that I have struggled with over many months, even years now but with more regularity and intensity in the past half year. I know that I need help managing it. In my ideation, the gun is my method of suicide; however, I don't exactly feel suicidal currently...? In fact, I have never tried to harm myself before nor am I actively planning an attempt. But I frequently desire death, feel extremely depressed, and fantasize about killing myself. I also often fear that I could and would/will kill myself.I don't know what to do. I really want to be open about the gun and my troubling thoughts but I live with my family and am TERRIFIED of them finding out about my mental health issues and suicidal ideation. I recently came across a news article about a California man's guns being confiscated because his wife was voluntarily committed for mental illness (this occurred in 2013 though). I guess my fear is that I'll be committed too or that law enforcement will attempt to confiscate my family member's gun. In either scenario, my family would undoubtedly learn of the situation and I just so desperately want to avoid that.Do you have a similar experience? Do you know what the protocol is if a patient reveals a plan and means (being a firearm), but not necessarily active or immediate intent? What is the likelihood that law enforcement would attempt to confiscate the firearm?*might post to multiple subreddits"
There's only one thing keeping me alive at this point.,"Starting in middle school, I stopped wanting to be alive. That drive for new experiences, for interaction, that happiness, died with my best friend when she hung herself. I'm not angry with her for what she did. I understand why she did it. I'm angry at everything that's happened since then. The people who made me feel guilty for it and blamed me. All the suicides and attempts from the people I loved. I lost three people to suicide. Five of them never succeeded. It will take too much for me to write out everything that's led me here for the past seven years. I just recently graduated high school and started college. I've spent so long hurting that I don't know what happy feels like. A couple years before I lost my friend, I started dating my boyfriend, who I'm still with today. He's a big part of why I'm still holding on. I guess I've just made the realization that nothing I'm doing is really for me. I don't actually have anywhere in life I want to go.  I don't have a goal. Any passion. I'm just doing everything in the order that everyone is telling me I'm supposed to do things in. Graduate. Get a job. Start college. Move out. I'm so lonely. I'm not really staying for any other reason than the fact that I've had to see what suicide does to the people left behind so many times. I love my boyfriend so much. I love my mom. I love my friends. But it's just not enough to stay. I'm only here so they don't have to feel that pain I've had to feel so many times. I hate thinking about what happens after they find me. My parents having to outlive two children. My boyfriend breaking down every time he sees our photos and all the things we've made for each other these past seven years. My friend having to cope with losing her dad and me the same way. It hurts so bad to think about. I spent a year in therapy, and was switched around different anti depressants for that time. Nothing worked. I just stopped showing up.I don't really know why I'm writing this. I'm just hurting and I don't want to be here but I know I can't go through with it. Please help me."
I feel no emotions,Have I accepted this as the end. My wife and kids are gone. It's my fault and I'm feeling sick physically and mentally. My brain is against me. My family is against me. THE WORLD IS AGAINST ME. RIP ME FROM THIS SOON I WANT IT TO STOP
I'm in so much pain right now. Should I kill myself? I don't know what I should do. Please help...,"I'm 17. I have depression and suicidal thoughts. I self harm practically everyday. When I was young, about 6 or so, I was physical, emotionally and sexually abused by members of my family. They say they had to do it. I was misbehaving. I asked for it. I'm a guy so I should get over it. I'm still living in this situation. I don't know what to do. I have no where to go. Maybe I should just kill myself? Maybe my life doesn't matter. Maybe I'm what's wrong."
My girlfriend has suicidal thoughts,"My 6 months girlfriend has been a victim of physical and sexual abuse as a child from her step dad. She still lives with her step dad.She has depression and suicidal thoughts because of her lack of self worth and reason/hope to live. The only people that care about her is me and her mum.Self worth isn't something you can just give but I want to do my best to improve her well being. Ideally for her she would want us to be together forever (that's what she says) because no one else cares about her. I'm not ready to give my life to her but I'd give anything else just so she can have hope in life.Our relationship is great. We've had amazing times together. She say's I'm the best thing that's happened to her. But what I want is to be sure if our relationship ends, she'd have hope to live.I'm looking for what I can do in the short term because I don't think we'll be together forever. I care about her so much. What's the best thing I could do to ensure that she won't kill herself in the future?"
feeling clear,"I have felt suicidal for around 5-7 years. I normally feel suicidal when i am very sad, usually thinking of suicide as a way to stop being a burden on my family. Today, i did not feel sad , i felt very clear. I felt like the best option for me was to disappear. I do not feel like i can function in society. I am ashamed of what i have done and how i have treated those who tried to love me. I do not pity myself at all, the condition i am in is all because of my own actions. I feel certain that my life will not get any better, although i couldnt possibly know that. Honestly, i am afraid. I feel disguting in my own body, i feel like every second i spend in it is almost torturous."
Still here,"I know I post here quite a bit (in my opinion), but I'm just in the process of building up the courage to try and end it once again. I hope I won't be around to post here much longer.I don't really have any meaningful relationships anymore. Everybody that somewhat cared for me abandoned me. I myself carry an aura that depresses people, which is probably one of the reasons why I get abandoned a lot.I'm in my first year of college and out of the four classes I have, the only one that is really just suicide fuel for me is Biology. I failed the first exam, there's so much homework, and I suck at studying.And on top of that, there's this lingering conflict in my mind, with one side telling myself to keep on living while the other is trying to get me to finally end it. The latter side is gaining ground rather quickly.My family decided to plan our trip to Hawaii (again) right in the middle of my semester, in fact, it's actually right around midterms. I'll be gone the second week of October. I tried to talk them out of going during that time, but they just don't understand that my classes are rather rigorous even though they've been through college as well. They just say, ""You'll just catch up when you get back."" Pffft... It's already hard for me to catch up after missing a day of class, how the hell am I going to catch up after missing an entire week of class?I figure that after this trip, I'll finally do it. It's quite fitting, actually. One last trip to paradise before I fade away for eternity. Life really isn't worth living, no matter what anybody says. I feel terrible all the time, I hate waking up because after the first few seconds of waking up, the pain returns and I realize that I'm still living, and I also hate laying down to sleep, because I know that morning will eventually come (it's one of the reasons why I stay up so late). I used to be able to at least do my work, but even now that's a mental chore for me. All I'm doing right now is existing and going to school, and tricking my mind into thinking that life is worth living for such and such passions which don't even make me feel any sort of excitement or happiness anymore. I can't socialize. Trust me, I've tried. Many many times. I don't know what it's like to be valued by someone else.As much as I want to live to get rich and find happiness, I have come to realize that the journey to seeking happiness is somewhat a false hope kind of thing, and I figure that even if I reach my goals I still won't be any happier or any less lonelier than I am today. Besides, I think being dead is better than suffering through every single second of my life. My existence is literally pointless. Why not put an end to this ridiculousness?"
Going to do it...,"Yup, this worthless ignorant son of a bitch is going to attempt suicide today! I will be trying to suffocate myself with a pillow tonight, I'm going to force myself to not resist and feel the pain and suffering. I don't deserve to live, and I can't handle being this way. Fuck you shyness and social anxiety, thanks for ruining my life. I'm sure my parents will be fine without me, I hate how religious they are. I have to pretend to care, but I really ironically do not. This is too much for a 16 year old to handle, I hope this works I don't wanna even celebrate my 17th birthday in December 8th. All this stress and my fucking English teacher crumbled up my paper and threw it in the trash because, I accidentally smeared my Book Check paper with my Quick Write, everyone in the class saw, and was in shock. He said""How many times have I told you not to do this?"" He only told me like once though, fucking hate this and got to present on November 6th. I can't handle public speaking it's so bad for me. Yeah i'm looking for pity and attention, I saw someone in a post here and they got cussed out. Cool, I hope nobody gives a fuck about this shithead of a child. I see no reason not to. All I've been doing is bluffing, time to do the actual action. Things won't get better, I have tried to listen to that."
I don't know what to do about my girlfriend,"This is such a tricky situation and I don't know what to do.. I started dating my current girlfriend 2 years ago, we met online via a game and have been in a long distance relationship, though we've met up dozens of times and have stayed with each other for weeks at a time sometimes.Both of us have dealt with depression for a long time, and when we started dating she was the sole reason I wanted to stay alive still. It feels reversed nowadays; I still love her a lot and she loves me, but my depression has gotten so much worse since I started seeking help (which I gave up on because my life felt considerably worse when I started acknowledging the depression) and I'm an even more negative person now than I was back then. I think this may have pushed on to her and now we are just a rolling ball of negativity.It feels like it is going to push me over the edge to suicide, but I also feel that if I leave her I will be pushed over the edge to suicide because I don't have anything going for me if I don't have her. On top of that it would crush her and the guilt itself in that would just fuck me up. I don't know what to do. Should I just try and get over it and push through until it feels like it is getting better? Should I risk leaving her ending in a likely suicide for me and a possible one for her? I'm not even good for her, I'm such an awful emotional support, I can't even support myself, how can I support her?Even if I did decide to break it off with her, I have no idea how. This is the first and only relationship I've ever been in and I really don't think I'd ever find someone else that would be willing to be with me that I also like. But putting future possible relationships aside (if I continue living to even have a second), I don't know what I should do about this one.I'm so lost and confused and I don't know what I can do about it, please help me. I'm sorry I came here instead of  or  but they wouldn't understand the depression situation like I feel a lot of you would."
Idk whatelse to do,"Hey Reddit I don't have anyone else to talk to and I never post to Reddit. I'm 25 and feel like I'm going to lose it all. I have  cirrhosis my liver cause I would just stay drunk after my mom died, I drank everyday for the last 3 years. I spent over 2 weeks in the hospital so my job let me go. I do have a girlfriend who lives with me but is no longer happy. She will make comments about she doesn't love me and hasn't been happy for months. We are just on a lease together. Now rent is due that I can't pay, no family to fall back on or help me. Now I just can't stop thinking about being with my mom. I don't wanna be homeless and lose everything again . I'm at the wall"
"Update from my post a week ago, dog bit puppy and I blamed myself for it's death.","Thank you people so much for the support. I was off of my meds for a week  because they ran out and my mother was overseas for work, which is so why I was looking after the puppies.They were born in the very early morning and I checked on them every 1,5 hours the whole day, at about 2 or something in the next morning I left the mom dog with the babies while I went to wash my hands. When I came back she had bitten the really badly. She was holding it by what was left of it's head and I completely freaked out and instantly blamed myself. I know I did my best, we already decided this dog isn't getting anymore puppies, she was also aggressive towards the last litter.The sad thing is, she bit the other one as well, the other puppy was defecating blood throughout the day and died in my hands while I was crying and begging for it to have a better life than this one.For those concerned, I had to look after the puppies because my mom breeds with yorkies and when the mom was close to being due, she had to go on an important work trip across the world. In this time I ran out of medication and couldn't get until she came back and I was entrusted to look after the puppies. I'm on my medication again for those wondering. Thank you for the supportAlso sorry if anything is weird, English isn't my main language"
It's my birthday in less then 10 minutes but I have never felt so worthless and depressed.,"I have always had thoughts of suicide on my mind but have always been too afraid to do anything since I am terrified of death. But lately my life has not been getting any better, one day is worse then the first and the stress builds up and I am in a situation where I am worthless in every way. I honestly don't feel like I belong here and don't deserve to be alive, everyone hates me. People only humor me, this life isn't worth living. I never thought I would be here writting these words Edit: if anyone could please let me know how much Tylenol I can take safely without killing myself that would be helpful, as much as I feel like killing myself I'd rather get close to the edge without actually jumping off it. I want to numb myselfEdit: I didn't take any Tylenol instead I drank a wine cooler and some. NyQuil but since I have been taking NyQuil every night it has no affect on me, also I want to express my appreciation for the birthday wishes however I just want to point out that I am not searching for birthday wishes or attention I just felt like I needed to vent "
Therapy has made things worse.,"I started going to a therapist 6 months ago. Tonight, I'm considering going to the ER.I could rant about my problems, thought patterns, history, abuses, traumas, addiction, etc., all fucking night. I could do it and I would probably never run out of terrible things to say about myself. Why am I like this? I can't keep up the facade of ""ok"" or ""normal"" anymore. A friend (they all live in another country) messaged me on facebook a few months ago while I was blackout drunk. The next morning, I had 47 missed calls from him and I read through the messages I sent. I laid out pretty much a summary of how I feel and the Big Words: ""I wish I was dead."" Since then, he has offered to be a wall to bounce anything off of, no matter what. Countless posts in this subreddit are written by people who truly do not seem to have anyone in their lives to even talk to, let alone have a person to vent to. I feel very ashamed and guilt-ridden that I cannot appreciate and use the support I have.But here's the thing...I don't want it. I think that being sad, being angry...its all I have. Its my personality. Its my passion. Before I turned 12, I knew I wanted out of this place. I knew that it, and the people in it, weren't for me and I will NEVER understand or be one of them. I've learned to be quite the performer, many say I am charismatic and cheerful. After 29 years, something has got to give. I've told my therapist the gist of what I have typed here and they directed me to the emergency room. I'm not going to do it tonight. I probably won't for a couple years, just for the grandparents to pass on with their version of me in their minds. Its the least I can do, I had a charmed childhood and they were a part of it.Thanks to anyone reading this rant. Without the internet, the sheer ""normalness"" of the world would have pushed me over long ago."
"Disowned, overstaying in a foreign country, going back to home country is a bullet-swallow","I am Ukrainian and I am 21 years old. I have been in Canada for 4 years now. Everytime I would speak up about my feelings to my family, I would be objected and called a selfish jerk because I have things to express about as a minor. My parents were verbally abusing me all my childhood Everytime I would speak up about how I feel about certain things in a polite way possible. I was raised mostly by my grandparents until I turned 12 when parents started to stay home more rather than go around countries doing fuckall whatever it is. My grandparents introduced to hobbies I always loved like videogames, cooking and football, I was introduced into them, also my grandfather was the biggest influence to me that made me embrace computers, games and how they are made. I had his computer after he passed away due to heartstop, I was never depressed being 14 years old, I cried a lot for 4 days straight. My other grandfather was also raising me who was a WW2 veteran, he had a crazy love for animals and music, and my voice comes from genes of his vocals, unfortunately he also passed away due to a heart stop. Losing 2 grandfather's at the same time of age is fucking horrible. I felt like I lost all hope but I inherited all what they loved. My parents never liked or never interested in what I did, constructing my first 3D character model in a pirated version of 3ds max to use in source engine bring a 14-15 year old, I would never have anyone noticing me. I feel lonely. My high school grades were horrible, but I loved doing 3D designs and minor programming for game development, I loved video games thanks to my grandfather. My parents never liked my doing, they would take my grandfather's PC away, that was constructed by him for me, because I don't give enough care or attention to my parents, but I never felt care nor love for them even though they kept buying me stuff never ask for and I kept saying ""I'm fine with what I have."", Instead I would be told ""You look like a fucking hobo and you should listen to us."". My grades were cheated by my parents cause they wanted to get rid of me and send me over to s different country - Canada. I had seen many opportunities of what's in there, but bring a misslguided 17 year old boy it was very hard for me to embrace an environment like school, I am not good at studying in classes, and my attention span makes it worse. I don't even know if I am mentally ill, I was never checked if I had anything conflicting with my health psychologically or not, until I realized I am fucked. My parents registered me and sent me to Canada with a degree of science when it was clearly agreed it's a computing science, it costed us extra for changing the banchelor from science to IT cause of their fuck up, but I was at fault for expressing it and I have to pay for everything they did to me in live apparently starting from diapers to what it is. I would always be fucked by my father's.temper issues leading me to confusion, fear, severe anxiety and sadness. There is another in my head right now I am very sorry for such mixed sentences. My first semester was grim, it was hard for me to focus on subjects, I wish I could study everything alone in piece without time frames and literally sit for hours at the computer screen reading articles and examples over and over again without going to someone who needs to give me marks. With that I found out I have a social anxiety, I had fear to face my instructor and people at University in general even advisors, because I feared they will report me or something and it will be known by parents, so I decided to not show up at classes at all. I've been spending all the money on tools for PC from Autodesk, online courses for advanced 3d but also for more expensive equipment so I could experience how it is to work with such specs. It sounds very selfish, but I thought it's an opportunity for me, I've been getting noticed by gaming communities, their developers, meeting with people who made the games I love and it was such an honor to work with them for their projects volunteerely, but not when shit went down.I am still in Canada, currently overstaying my study/work visa with a severe depression, anxiety and pretty much with a willing to die in bed right now. I failed the university, things it provided was not for me, I was very afraid to speak up about it to my parents that j don't like it otherwise I would've experienced a biggest guilttrip and mindfuck rather than s rational discussion I am always up to, but no, everything has to be fucked by me. It's all my fault. I was holding my parents behind all that time in Ukraine with this shitty situation there going on, knowing they might get shot or die anytime soon, but I don't feel care or love for them at all. I wanted to enjoy my life without them. I liked about graduation, they still went over here when I said multiple times don't come over here, then later on I had to tell them about what actually happened and how I felt about it. They made their way here to tell me all this in person, punch me in the face with the cup, destroy my belongings and take my national Ukrainian citizen passport to ""do something that is not bad to me, don't worry"" they said, when I clearly feel it is being disowned. I didnt feel anything this moment,y body was sore, cold, I was ready for anything to get hit by, I didn't care, pain is all I want in this life, after that I was laying down the trail rails waiting for a train to rain me over slicing my head just right, but no train was there, I went back home to my room to try and fall asleep. I wish I did not wake up. I couldn't find a proper job that could situate me in Canada, out of an impulse I was very desperate for anything to start life anew, move to Australia with my shitty minimal funds somehow to meet the love I met and friends/family I made through all these 6 years online... I want to go to Australia, but with my no uni skills and with only 489 sponsored worker visa I do not know where to go. I have anxiety that I will never make it there, never see.my loved one and friends in Australia even though I kept telling them I can.make it there when I shave no knowledge in visas and travels there whatsoever. I have fear that if I come back to Ukraine I'm going to forcefully be sent to army where ear is still going and my mind tells me I should shoot myself there just to not give satisfaction of killing me to anybody else. I do not know what to do. I feel like I will never make it to Australia with my worthless, shitty, stupid existence of a corpse that will never achieve anything in life. I'd rather jump off the roof and die, or wait for a train in the middle of a night so it can run me over. Life is not worth it, j don't think any employers will come back to me who wild will to sponsor such piece of shit."
06/10/2017,"I'm tired of going over my story. I'm tired of social workers, doctors, medication, hospitals and people only pretending to care so they can feel good about themselves.I find the world is a rotten place, but sometimes I feel like it's just me that's rotten. I could never hurt another person. Every time I back down from doing myself in, life gets worse and worse.I've set a date. October 6th, 2017. Everyone thinks it's when my next song is coming out.I don't want to be remembered."
Just feeling down for too long,First post. Lurked for a while. I feel like the only thing keeping me from killing myself is it I know it would hurt some people. More and more I feel like they'll all be better in the long run without me. Sorry I just felt like I had to put something out there to someone.
Please don't send me PMs,"I feel guilty that some stranger is showing some kindness and I can't repay them back.Anyway, just a few more days. I feel empty. I've given myself the liberty to do whatever I want for the next couple of days but there's nothing I want to do, you know? I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.No, I don't want to do anything about it. I know you're thinking I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't want help but I just want to leave this here like a note of some sort. Obviously this still doesn't explain why but I want people to know I had thought about this for a while and it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing."
Somehow I made another day.,"I'm tired. I think this is how people three times my age feel when they are lying in the hospital taking their final breaths. Just ready to be done. I constantly have to fight back against my gender dysphoria and depression. I've wanted to die since I was in grade school and the urge has just gotten stronger with age. Exhaustion is the best way I can describe what I feel. I don't see the point or why I should get up tomorrow. I made an attempt a couple of months back. I wish I would have succeeded then and not have to continue on with the daily debate. A bit of background about me. I was raped as a young child by multiple people. Then, a family member found out and used the shame of that trauma to rape me continuously until I left for university. I hate myself for not being strong enough to tell someone when it mattered; instead I kept everything secret and just let myself be screwed up.  I am also transgender and experience dysphoria, body image issues, and self hate on a daily basis. I'm in a good environment, surrounded by people who love me, I'm lucky to have amazing friends (more than I deserve by far), but still I just want to die. "
I'm Feeling Suicidal Again - I Really Need Advice,"For the past month I've been staying with my partner, and I just got back home today. We've been together for over two years now, and we're long distance. We visit each other three times a year or so but it never feels like enough.I've been struggling with chronic suicidality for almost as long as I've known my partner. When we're together I rarely even get depressed, but now I'm back home and I've been home for less than 12 hours and I feel suicidal again already. I spoke with my partner about moving in with him, but he's in the US and I'm in Canada, and the only way for us to legally move in with each other is for us to get married, which is something he says he's not comfortable with and he doesn't think he ever will be. He doesn't want to break up, and wants us to be together, but he says that maybe we might have to just be long distance because he doesn't think he'll ever be okay getting married. I don't want to get too into it, because I really feel like I need help quickly and don't feel like I have much time. I don't see a point in living if we're going to be apart like this forever. There's so much I'll miss out on, and I get so depressed being here. I don't see a way out. I feel very urgently like I want to kill myself. Please help me somehow. "
I've really just fucked up everything,"I've let myself lose a job that I really liked with people that I loved working with. I'm now working overnights which hasn't bode well for me in life before, I end up feeling more depressed and suicidal when I work jobs like this but it's all I could find.  I've fucked up a lot of friendships and relationships recently because of my attitude towards the world and my attitude towards others, getting mad at people for no good reason and I'm guessing it's exhausting dealing with me. I've ruined the closest thing I've had to a relationship with this guy. I doubt he'll ever want to talk to me again after what I just got done getting upset at him about, and I don't blame him whatsoever.  I joke about suicide a lot because it's how I dealth with my suicidal feelings a few years back, but the jokes are becoming reality and I want nothing more than to not be alive anymore.  I know this all sounds really fucking stupid and I have nothing going on in my life that warrants me wanting to put a gun to my head but I don't know what else to do. I'm a shitty person that has absolutely no future, why keep living life like this?  fuck"
I think I'll just sleep on it one more night.,Was planning on tonight being The Night.  But I think I'll sleep on it one more time.  Just posting this in case it anyone else might be thinking the same.
It feels more real.,I think when I first started having suicidal thoughts it was more of a comfort than a plan. Like if things ever got worse there was always a way out. Lately it feels a lot more real. I can't imagine a life where I don't end up killing myself anymore. Everything feels pointless. I'm not getting better. I don't even know what I'm trying to say.
Just want to die in two weeks,"Said some stuff I shouldn't have to therapist.
I just want to die before I need to see the therapist again. I've already been looking at legal dosages of things which I know possess serious threats to the human body.Or I move. But I have a year left here in HS even though I'm a legal adult. I can't move since I don't have much money when it comes to moving, and that all that money would need to go to a name change if I even wanted to board a plane. I need to move before 2 weeks if possible."
I just don't know how to feel anymore,"I hated my whole life ever since I started becoming conscious. My life has been up and down, parents always arguing, always getting bullied, even now in High-School.. people are using me and then they mock me. My girlfriend and mom are probably the only persons I really care about.. I'm not suicidal but I need help, I literally can't take it anymore, I don't understand why people are like this, I used to be their friend and now they do this to me. I'm their laughing dose of the day, they know that if they mock me I get angry and they just laugh at me like I'm lifeless.."
Getting Closer and Closer every day,"Thousands of dollars behind on bills, rent is due in a couple days and my wife and I can't even stop fighting long enough to talk about how we are going to try and fix things. I don't know what to do and I don't want to be alive when we get evicted but then I look at my kids and I just cry. Part of me doesn't want to leave them.. but there's a part that just.. doesn't care.. I guess.. I've struggled on and off with the thought of killing myself for at least a decade but it's never been this bad before. I've always been the kind of person to just run away when shit gets tough but this time I have nowhere to run to..Please tell me it can get better. Please help me see it because right now I just want to be gone."
I posted on here 19 days ago..,"..and very little has changed. Things have slowly gone downhill, despite all that's happened in the past 19 days, I'd say two weeks within those 19 days were fairly unforgettable.. but I genuinely miss the circumstances in which those two (really three and a half weeks) were spent. The only person I have really any true feelings for is quite hard to get through. Despite what I (vaguely) know, I don't even know how they truly feel about me. Part of me says ""why bother?"", but I know I can't. Regardless.. the past four/five days have been almost a blur. I've gone out for walks everyday for five, six hours at a time.. I still feel manage to feel worse. I keep coming to the same conclusion, I'm not sure why I even bother waking up. There's a quote by Vladimir Lenin I read that's stuck with me. It seems very relevant, but I still.. don't know. No matter what I do or try.. what's the point? Just offing myself seems the best option.. there's very little for me to do other wise. Suicide, amongst a few important things, is the only thing on my mind.. it's very tempting at this point"
Why am i so sad 24/7,"Halfway past high school i started feeling this way but since my mother doesn�۪t really believe in psicological illness i�۪ve never really tried to figure out what was wrong.
Now i�۪m a freshman in college and things were getting better related to that subject but since summer everything just got worst, i have suicidal thoughts again, like do i really matter? people would even notice if i�۪m not around? would they even care? do they care?
My boyfriend is super worried about me, only because we end up fight in my crisis and they affect him so how, but he never even asks me if i�۪m okay... I end up crying almost every day, everything always gets so blue somehow, sometimes because of the fights, but mostly everything gets so confusing and overwhelming in my head that i can�۪t help to be mad or cry, usually both.
I want help, but will a talk with a psychiatrist really help? He will give me medication but they can make things worst not better..."
I don't deserve to be here,"The horrible shitty thing I've done makes me want to die every single day that I'm still here. I don't know how to make all the voices in my head stop, I don't know how to be okay. I have no one. I'm losing my mind with all this shit going on in my head and I can't stand it anymore "
That voice inside your head,"What does it say to you?I�۪ve been in counseling and heard it described as ���intrusive thoughts�۝ and inner monologue. It�۪s suggested that the voice/voices and phrases you constantly repeat in your head is depression itself (almost like a separate entity).I�۪m curious what phrases other people hear when they are in their lowest state. Here are some of mine:-People would be better off without you
-You�۪re nothing
-It will only get worse
-You only cause others pain
-You�۪re a failure
-You�۪re worthless
-Just give up
-You deserve to die
-Life is not worth it anymore
-What�۪s the point?So what are some other things that run through your mind when you are seriously contemplating suicide? Perhaps if we see others going through something similar it can help us all know we are not alone."
Its all over tonight.,"Its over today. No more excuses, no more waiting. Ive had suicidal thoughts for at least 10 years now,without anyone noticing or even caring. I have never been in a serious relationship, and everyone of my mate has told me im an embarresement for my family at least once in a fight or somthing along the lines. And they are right, everybody who blamed me of being lazy and idiotic and of no use is right.I hope you have a better shot at life.
I seriously do "
I'm at the psychiatrist rn,"He always makes you wait like an hour to see him for 5 minutes and by the time i get into his office i just want to leave; i don't feel like elaborating on how my nightmares have been getting worse, how i haven't deleted the suicide note on my phone from months ago, just in case, how i haven't been sleeping well, etc. I just  feel like even when I'm not suicidal in the moment, it's always going to be an inevitability. When i eventually die, it's going to be at my own hands"
Im sorry for this,"I'm nearly 30, I have a wife and child. Own a business.  Own a house.  Nothing ever gets better.  You will always hate yourself.  You will always want to die.  Please someone tell me something that will help.
The only thing therapists have done is hurt my credit and made it impossible for me to leave my son a life insurance policy.
I want to die every day, but I can't because I love my son too much.   Everything hurts, I'm a secret alcoholic, I'm secretly diabetic, I vomit and shit every morning.
But I love my son.  I can't leave him. "
I Suffer In Silence,"This is a burner account as If I posted my main, many would mock me for my political beliefs. So I created this instead.I struggle with Depression, it varies in strength. Sometimes I'll have my good days and the others not so much. I'm in my 2nd year of nursing school so stress isn't light. I've dealt with a lot of physical and emotional abuse as a kid and from time to time it haunts me in flashbacks. I'm 19 male, I've tried telling my dad whom im on good terms with about how I don't feel right and he just shrugs it off. He attempted suicide about 9 or so years ago from battling depression himself. He doesn't like talking about anything in that aspect so I feel isolated. I suffer in silence, As soon as I mentioned it to a friend I've had since growing up they distanced themselves from me. I tried counseling, talking to other people, making new friends. Talking doesn't resolve the issue. Lately I've been having severe intrusive suicidal thoughts, and I feel at this point if I don't find a way to numb/treat the pain I feel like something dire may happen. I feel so isolated even though im surrounded by faces, if that makes sense. To boot on that I have almost daily migraines, I've tried a slew of medication but nothing seems to help. So it's a constant cycle of either emotional or physical pain. I don't know what to do anymore.I didn't know where to post so I posted at  as well."
Am i all alone here?,"Hello. This is really hard for me, but im a 34 year old male and i am struggling to cope with the ever increasing thoughts of suicide or the days when my mind decides to start planning on killing people or acting out violent revenge on people who i only imagine are wrong doing me. i am currently pn a 5 month waiting list for councelling and anger management. At this current time, although i have an amazing wife and child and some good friends, i have never felt so alone. Sometimes i find talking to someone who is going through the same thing helps a little to make me realise im not alone in this world. please leave a messagd if you would like to chat. "
"I hate my life. No support, I've lost everything. Except the job I'm bullied at every fuckin day. Kill me. Why not give it a third try? I'm just a piece of shit anyway.","Hello,
will you be willing to tell me more?"
"I don't know how to change, I feel like it would be better if I just wasn't around","Sometimes, I really think I am crazy. Looking back at all my past mistakes, and trust me, there�۪s a LOT of them, I often wonder how I�۪m even still alive. In fact, most of the actions in my 25 years of existence have been missteps, simple mistakes that could�۪ve easily been avoided with better attention, calm awareness, and rational thinking. But what bothers me the most is, as I got older, and continued to make mistakes, even though I became smarter [at least I think I did] and became more aware that some of the actions I took or were about to take were not good choices, despite that, I still chose to make them anyway. I didn�۪t care, I just wanted to feel good in the moment, I wasn�۪t thinking about who would suffer [which was me most of the time] and what the consequences would be, I just wanted to be happy, even if it was for a very short amount of time, I wanted to at least pretend that I could have long lasting happiness in my life, whether it be in the form of games and toys I stole money for, rebelling against my elders because I didn�۪t [and still don�۪t] like being told what to do even though they only had my best interest at heart [at least i hope they did], seeking the company of unsavory, unkind, or immoral people because I wanted to feel acceptance so badly that I was willing to LITERALLY pay for it by buying them stuff, and seeking the companionship of animals, because I figured, ���At least they won�۪t judge me for my weirdness.�۝ My ���weirdness�۪ being my interests and demeanor. The only people I feel I�۪ve ever been able to be my true self around without fear of rejection are my online friends who share many similar problems with me when it comes to dealing with depression. My inability to effectively be around others in a public or a ���real life�۪ setting without at some point driving them away stems from my insecurity and angst. Yea, a grown-ass 25 year old man has angst. Maybe other people my age do as well, but that�۪s besides the point. First off, I�۪m a nerd, of epic proportions. I collect Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, watch cartoons, draw and buy comics, the works. But I�۪m smart enough to realize that those interests aren�۪t enough to repulse 95% of the people I come into contact with. My insecurities are, however. These insecurities stem from my fear of being rejected due to my interests, which in turn, cause me to act like a complete ass to people because I believe they think lowly of me because I what I like. I figure, ���Well, they�۪ll never see me as anything other than a loser, so fuck ���em, they don�۪t deserve my respect.�۝ Yea, real smart thinking. Thinking which at some point, no matter what group of people I end up with, causes me to do and say very annoying, weird, and sometimes offensive things to them. And when I DO get rejected, it only fuels my insecurities and projections of other people looking down on me, causing me to become angry or frustrated. Not hard to see why I�۪ve never been able to keep or even have real friends for most of my life. Despite that, however, there are SOME people who have the good grace to put up with me and my stupidity. Ironically, these people usually tend to be very religious. I guess you would have to be blessed by the holy spirit to be able to endure my nonsense. Or maybe there�۪s some truth to what Bill Burr once said, how assholes seek out wonderful people to be around because other assholes won�۪t put up with them. And while I am more than grateful to have my best friend of 7 years in my life, the fear of losing them always lingers over my head, like its an eventuality with me, that I�۪ll never be able to have a stable lasting relationship with another person. The majority of why I feel this way, I suppose, comes from my relationship with my family. Now let me say one thing before I go any further. I love my parents, and I love my siblings. And even though I don�۪t agree with of like some of the choices they�۪ve made in life, that fact will never change. Then again, how can I say I love them when looking back on my actions in my youth, particularly between the ages of 7-15, and how horrible I was. As I mentioned before, I used to steal. A lot. Particularly from my father. I�۪d use the money to buy childish things to enjoy, not caring if I got caught, at least in the moment. I couldn�۪t happiness from other people, I sought it in objects. I also used to beat up my siblings and say really mean things to them, probably because I got bullied a lot at school, and didn�۪t know how to vent my aggression and anger. My little brother got it the worst. I�۪d pin him down, punch him, slam him into things, say horrible horrible things to and about him. My mother see this and say, ���What�۪s wrong with you? Don�۪t you realize your brother looks up to?�۝ Looking back, I really could�۪ve messed my brother up and helped him grow into an awful person like me. Luckily, my brother is smart, and knows not to follow in my dumbass footsteps. So do my sisters. Things weren�۪t always bad between us, I still remember days when the 5 of us would just play together and not hurt each other. Funny enough, these days often involved us doing very stupid things for fun, like jumping off the roof, and or ���wars�۪, in which we would grab anything that wasn�۪t nailed down and hurl it at each others�۪ heads. Still, the cruelty I showed towards them left an impression and later showed as we grew. The thing I regret the most was something I did when I was 13-14. In my youth [ages 4-5], I was a coward and sometimes called my dad to sleep in the bed with me when I had nightmares. Around my early teens, there was a night when my youngest sister, who was about 6-7 at the time, walked into my room and asked if she could stay in there, because she was afraid of the dark as well. I told her to grow and leave, to which she did, in a very saddened voice. My youngest sister asked me for help, help with something I suffered with as well and one point, and I flat out rejected her. Some brother I am. As we got older, I calmed down a bit and tried to form better relationships with my siblings, but they rejected me at every turn. Whenever I�۪m at work and talk about my siblings and people ask me if we�۪re close, I smile and lie, saying ���yes.�۝ I can�۪t blame them at all, I don�۪t in anyway justify of defend my actions, but instead try to make sense of them to myself if no one else. Part of this aggression that I had [and still have somewhat] inside of me is likely not just from the schoolyard bullying I endured, but also the discipline I received from my father. I can remember as far back as my time in pre-K that he�۪d hit me. I can even remember the first time he struck me. He was trying to teach me to tie my shoes and I just couldn�۪t seem to get it, so he smacked my hand with one of this shoes [he wore size 12s lol ouch]. The beatings would come mostly from my lack of good grades in elementary school. He would sometimes pick me up from school and bring me to bathroom of his office and spank me with his belt when I got a low mark. The worst 2 beatings I remember were when my mother was out of town and I tried to sneak up on my dad and scare him as a joke, to which he replied by chasing my to his closet where I tried to hide, and kicked me when he couldn�۪t pull me out to spank me, and the other being when he hurled a chair at me when I was 8 for not bringing my books home from school. For a while I thought this was something every kid felt with when they got disciplined by their parents, but talking to other kids made me think otherwise. I can even remember being sent to therapists as a child, because my parents were so concerned with my grades that they thought I was mentally ill, and when therapists would ask me if i got spanked, I�۪d lie and say no, unknowingly doing so out of loyalty to my folks. I wasn�۪t the only one who suffered my father�۪s wrath. He later went on to slam my mother into a window for not aborting my youngest sister, a fact I would later use as fuel for a horrible comment I would tell my sister when we would fight, ���Dad never wanted you anyway.�۝ Christ, I�۪m a scumbag. My dad later had a stroke when I was 9, and died when I was 14. My mother, bless her heart, did and continues to do her best for all 5 of us. She�۪s not perfect, but she loves us, even when she does some questionable things. There have been times when I would talk about how my father would discipline me and she would say things like, ���That never happened,�۝ and then would go on to say things like, ���If your father was here, he�۪d knock you on your ass,�۝ when I would disobey her or act out. My mother has a knack for getting under my skin, she knows just what to say to get my so angry that I have to leave the room or the house. Not surprising when she brags about how she was a bully in her youth. If there is a god, maybe me getting bullied so much is some sort of cruel irony thrust apron my mom by the vengeful spirit of god. Anywho, my mother later became the main disciplinary force in the household after my father was unable to do so due to his illness. It wasn�۪t as bad as having it be my father though, 1 being due to the fact I was a teenager and much bigger at the point, and 2 her being a woman made the blows less painful as well. However, getting hit in your 20s usually doesn�۪t prompt the same response as it did when you were 6. One day she tried to hit me for forgetting to do something small, I can�۪t even remember, and when she swung, I blocked her hand and pushed her to the ground. And that was the day I got kicked out the house. I lived at my grandparents�۪ for the next few years, until I eventually moved back to help my mother with her current problems. One thing i found very interesting is one day when my mother took me out for my 24th birthday, she asked about my future plans in life. Embarrassed because I didn�۪t have any, I asked her, ���What did you want to do when you were my age?�۝ She simply replied, ���Find a safe place.�۝ This made me think back to all the stories my mother would tell me how she would endure physical and emotional abuse from her brother and mother. My grandfather, her father, and the best man I�۪ve ever known, thankfully, didn�۪t inflict any abuse on her or her brother and sister. Thinking about that comment and my past, it troubles me to think that my mother likely believes to she failed in finding or making a ���safe place�۪ for her and her children. Around the time I turned 17, I began to turn a new leaf. I wanted to have a good relationship with my family, I wanted friends, maybe a girlfriend, and respect from my peers. However, I soon realized in my idiocy in my younger years, I had missed out on learning social skills and had severely damaged my relationship with my family. And while I DID want to get better, I still continued make dumb decisions, like put off my studies and say mean things to my siblings. My family also said [and some still say] very demeaning things to me. So I trained myself I have no or very little reaction to them, even though they hurt. This indifferent demeanor I developed caused them and other people to see me as uncaring or cold. Despite my efforts however, I�۪ve often been told that I have ���resting angry face�۪ or always look very serious or sad. I continued on, seeking help from people I found online who seemed to have similar issues with self-loathing and feeling like a failure. And after some serious soul-searching and looking back on all my missteps, it became apparent to me that my likelihood of finding another human being in real life I could truly do right by would be very unlikely. So, I turned to animals. I figured if I could at least do right by another living thing, that I wouldn�۪t truly be evil. Because even if I cleaned up my act, changed my attitude about myself and other people completely, it wouldn�۪t undo all the horrible things I did. But, if I could care for an animal, and never bring harm or allow harm to come to them, I could find a way to live myself. I began to invest most of my time at home with my dog, bringing him with me wherever I could, allowing him to live my room when I could and sleep next to me in bed. He�۪s been with me for 10 years, and I love him like family. Recently, he ran away, which caused me to become very distraught. For 4 agonizing days, I get home from work and walk around the neighborhood and surrounding areas, shouting his name, looking for him in every space he could possibly be, asking people for possible tips and even offering a cask reward. I even sobbed when it occurred that I might never see him again, whether he got picked up by some random people, or was killed. The thought of me failing him was too much to bare. Luckily, he was returned to me safe an sound. But I began to think, what if he got out again? With my luck, he might be gone for good next time. I thought, ���Maybe if I get him a companion, something that�۪ll help him WANT to stay home, he won�۪t run off again.�۝ Which brings me to what prompted me to type this little essay on my stupid existence. A few weeks ago, I went to an ABC to get the addresses on my driver�۪s license and state ID changed. I arrived there early, and saw there was a Petsmart across the street. I decided to go in, thinking I might find some good supplies for Deuce [my dog]. I found that this store not only sold pet supplies, but also offered pets for adoption. There were birds, lizards, turtles, fish, and cats. That�۪s when I first saw them, my kittens, Sophie and Sapphire. Two small black kittens, curled up together in a cage against some glass. ���That�۪s it!�۝ I thought. If I could just adopt these cats and introduce them to Deuce, he�۪d have companions. This, of course, was another awful decision on my part. Not only did I not have the first inkling on how to properly take care of kittens, but there was no way in hell my mother would allow MORE animals in her home. Despite me knowing this however, I chose to adopt them both a few days later [pursuit of happiness n all that]. I figured I�۪d learn how to take care of them and after having them in the house for a while without my mother knowing, and then revealing to her that they haven�۪t made a mess, and also using the fact that I�۪ve been helping her ever since I moved back in with her, she�۪d allow me to keep them. Flawless logic, I know. Well, 1 the kittens DID make a mess, like one of my coworkers warned me they would, and 2, it didn�۪t take long at all for my sister to discover them in my room. Right off the bat she told me, ���You need to tell mom soon, or I will.�۝ After doing my best to convince her to give me more time, I managed to clean up the mess made and plan my next move. Sophie and Sapphire had time to become well acquainted with me and my room in the 2 weeks they were there. I became quite fond of them as well. I hadn�۪t had time to properly introduce them to Deuce however. He had flees at the time and it was recommended to me to keep the kittens away form other animals with flees and to slowly introduce them to other animals in the household. Then a realization dawned on me. What if my mother wouldn�۪t let me keep them? What if they got sent back to the shelter they came from? What if they got separated? What if they were adopted by someone who wouldn�۪t take good care of them or abuse them? I decided that if worse came worse, I�۪d find a new proper owner myself, someone I could stay in constant contact with, someone I�۪d interview myself to see if they�۪d take good care of the kittens. There were many takes, many were collage students who wanted one kitten for a companion. However, I desperately wanted to keep them together because they were sisters, and wanted them to at least have company if their owner didn�۪t give them enough attention themselves. Then the day came, when my sister told my mother about the kittens in my room. I braced myself for the verbal lashing, the name calling, the curse words, everything I expected to happen after enduring it for so long after I went against my mother�۪s demands. Then, to my utter shock, I got a text from my sister that said, ���Mom says you can keep them if you clean up the roach pills off the floor in the laundry room and put them in there.�۝ I couldn�۪t believe it. Things were going to be alright, I could keep them, I could give them the care and home I promised to give them. Then, as if god himself decided to give me the finger, I got another text saying, ���The cats have got to go, they gave me ringworm.�۝ Then everything I feared would happen happened. What especially hurts about this was how my mother and sister assume that I don�۪t care that my sister got sick from the cats, that I�۪d gladly risk their health by bringing animals home, that I care more about cats than them. I had no clue that the kittens were sick, and wouldn�۪t have brought them home if I knew otherwise. And I would�۪ve also paid for any treatment my sister required. Despite that, they have every right to be angry with me. I was forced to find the kittens a new owner, someone who I thought would be a constant contact with me, but who is now unresponsive to me. I fear the worst for my cats. I�۪m probably being over dramatic again, but I can�۪t help it. I hurt my family, again, due to my negligence and dishonesty, and I may have effectively hurt the lives of two animals. Every time I mess up, I always try to piece together what led me to make such horrible choices. I don�۪t know how I became so broken that I can�۪t have stable relationships with people, or make choices that don�۪t end up hurting someone or something. Its getting to the point where I don�۪t even want to know the answer anymore, the answer that might�۪ve led me down the path to fixing myself. I just want it all to end, I�۪m tired of to trying to deny that I�۪m a horrible person, someone who doesn�۪t deserve to live. I know for a fact that if I just disappeared, so many people�۪s lives would be better for it. But right now, Deuce still depends on me, and I want at least help my mother with her current problem, which SHOULD be solved in the next few months. But after I�۪m no longer needed, I can�۪t see any real point in sticking around. Ever since I was a child, the idea of killing myself has been in my head, even before I became aware of the concept of suicide. I would look over bridges I�۪d walk over or be driven over, thinking what it be like if I just threw myself off. Would it be painful? Would I not have to deal with people anymore? Would I be missed? Being older now, I�۪m pretty sure I know the answers to the questions, yet, it still doesn�۪t me from those thoughts. I�۪m sorry to my family for being such a monster, I wish I could�۪ve known sooner how I should�۪ve acted, I wish I could�۪ve seen how my awfulness would�۪ve effected you in the years to come. You all are truly the most important people in my life, and I don�۪t want to hurt you. I�۪m sorry to Sophie and Sapphire, I wanted to give you a loving home, but do to my dishonesty, I was able to do that, I let you both down. Maybe if I had been honest in the beginning, you�۪d be home with me right now, and not with some stranger who I foolishly trusted to care for you. And to all the people who are or who tried to be my friends, I�۪m sorry to all of you for being so unbearable. You deserve a better friend than me, and if you chose to walk away from me now, I wouldn�۪t hold it against you at all, cuz I�۪d walk away from me too."
I'm running out of time/options/resources,"I don't know exactly what help I'm looking for. I have been doing fine for a couple months in what I thought would be a slow progression towards stability. Except i guess it wasn't fast enough. ii hoped i could grow enough that i could get a job so i could start paying off my credit card debt. i couldn't, and i've been avoiding all the calls from the bank because a) everytime i gave it thought it would always lead back to me thinking about suicide and b) phone calls give me so much anxiety that it also leads to suicidal thoughts. this morning i just got a call from a collection agency. i'm pretty sure i'm just fucked at this point. even though i'm on my meds now this is the closest i've ever felt to killing myself, even compared to my attempts last year. i cant tell my parents because they already have enough with paying my student bills because i couldnt make it though a single fucking year. i thought about telling my doctors but dont see the point anymore. this is the last place i thought of because it doesnt involve talking in person or over phone but even as im writing i dont see the point in anything anymore"
I Feel Free,"I posted here earlier in the week about a recent suicide attempt, and I would like everyone who posts here to say good-bye or to share their anguish to read this so that they may be inspired by what has transpired in less than a week after a failed attempt.I know I'm not supposed to talk about methods, but it's relevant to my story and can give you hope as to when your ""better"" that everyone always says gets can happen. I was drinking an entire bottle of Jonny Walker as fast as I could to kill myself when in my drunken state I called up my best friend to tell him how I felt (maybe I was pussying out, maybe I was just drunk, at this point I'll never care.) He stayed on the line for over an hour with me to talk me down from the ledge, and so in the time I spent talking and not drinking, I didn't consume enough quickly enough to be lethal (it was a fucking monster of a hangover though) and I woke up the next day numb to the outside world. When I saw him again on Wednesday, he gave me a great big hug and a necklace that was given to him when he went through suicidal depression from his Unitarian church that turned his life around. On the necklace, it reads, ""what the caterpillar perceives as the end, to the butterfly is just the beginning."" Seeing the kind of support and effort my friend was giving just about tore me in half. When people tell you to think about your loved ones, it isn't to shame you into not doing it because of someone else's sake, it's because they want you to look at the people you can turn to for help. I never told a soul for the 9 long years I suffered from suicidal depression until I told him. I burdened myself with my demons because I don't like making my problem anyone else's, and so I played the part of Atlas, carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders when I didn't have to. I now understand that there are different ways of looking at things in life, like a phrase such as ""think of your loved ones,"" or the analogy between the caterpillar and the butterfly. We can look at every outcome in a negative, bleak way like our lives are over, or we can see it as an opportunity to start fresh and get back in the hunt, whatever it is we're hunting for. And if the hunt scares you, don't let it. Don't feed emotions that aren't worth feeding. If you suffer from social anxiety like I did, don't think about the rejection aspect that isn't even guaranteed with each encounter, think about the prospect of meeting new friends who might be as wonderful as my best friend, someone who will stand by your side as you walk down the most lonesome road known to mankind. Think of looking for a job in the most competitive labor market as the chance to find your calling in life. Think of a break-up in a long-term relationship as the chance to meet someone who won't leave you or you them.But what you need to know is that it all depends on you. You might not have to feed depression and sorrow and pain, but in order to feed a zest for life, an appreciation for nature, or general happiness, you need something to feed it with. Take me for example. I long for a relationship because I've never had one. I no longer feel despair over that fact, I instead make it my best effort to get what I want and I am excited for what I know will be around the corner, and there's nothing women love more than a confident man who's sure of himself. It will take hard work to present the best version of myself, but that's the one I want everyone to know; the one who smiles at every stranger I meet, the one who sits with people who eat their lunch alone, the one who is no longer afraid or ashamed of asking for help. And I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for reaching out for help and offering help to those who truly need it, because you're doing heavenly work.It's been a roller-coaster of a week for me, with some fucking nutty ups and downs, but I long for the ups nowadays, and I am willing to make it my life's work to reach out to those of you in need. I don't even have what I want out of life yet, and I already know I'm not going to attempt suicide ever again because of the future I can have if I put my best foot forward and add a little strut to my walk, humming Ripple by the Grateful Dead all along the way. Please heed my advice if it makes a modicum of sense to you, because I want all of you to get out of this hell we find ourselves in. I love you all, and I believe there are other people out there who value your life and want you to stick around. I'll be the president of your fan club if no one wants to join. Stay with us, and Godspeed. "
The idea of death seems so peaceful,"I want to do it, but I can't. And I want it."
would a bottle of ibuprofen do it?,"I have a whole bottle in my hand. If not enough, I have access to more pills. "
Something to hold onto,"Over a week ago I had posted on here about how I had reached a stage where I just wanted to end things and that having the option available to me was extremely comforting and it still is, those feelings haven't disappeared, however I realised I could never go through with it. Whenever I thought about it, one person would always pop into my head, my nephew. I couldn't do this to him, I don't want him to grow up without a male role model, I don't want him to grow up the way I did. I want him to look at me and be proud to call me his uncle, I want to live so he can have the best future possible.
I hope one day I can love myself and I will be working everyday to reach that stage, I've hit rock bottom and the only way is up.
I hope everyone else in this sub can find something to hold onto like I have. "
I'm here again. Feeling the weight of guilt and the pain of realization.,"I've had a rough couple of years. It started with an unknown illness. Doctors passed me around like a basketball, bouncing me from one test to another, never could quite pinpoint what was going on. Hormones were out of whack, possibly auto-immune. I got sicker and sicker and lost my job.Tried to start a business, and I am failing at that. Failing badly. I've ghosted on a client - I feel awful. I feel guilty. I don't know how to recover that relationship.I've been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit 3 times in the last 9 months - twice involuntary. Suicide attempts have fucked with my heart. It's hard to tell if I am feeling ill because of mental illness, or a physical illness, or a suicide attempt, or all of the above. The red pin-prick rashes on my feet and back tell me I'm not crazy, but doctors could never confirm an auto-immune disorder. Some days I am completely bed-ridden and can't function at all because of pain. So here I am again, considering suicide. There's nobody to catch me as I'm falling. If I can't make rent, I'm homeless. If I can't make money, my marriage is down the tubes. It's hard to see your dreams fade away as you desperately try to get healthy to no avail. I'm almost 28 -- I had plans, I had wants and wishes and goals. Now I can't even get out of bed in the morning without ibuprofen or pain killers of some kind. There's really no way this ends well. "
Done.,"Hey, you need to talk?"
I think I have depression.,"So I've been feeling suicidal for the past 2 or so years. I think I have depression. How would I go about getting diagnosed for this? I don't really want to just go up to my dad like ""hey, so I've been wanting to kill myself for a while now..."" Also, when I do get diagnosed, how would this effect me and my life?"
So tired...,"24 year old survivor of hellish childhood. Beaten 3-15, molested 8-15, raised by virulent narcissists my whole life. My mind is a hellscape constantly and i never get any peace. Haven't felt like living in years and just been too scared to end it. Harvey rolled through and took everything i've built since escaping my N's house. Been thinking seriously about a short drop and a sudden stop lately. Can't get it out of my head. I'm just so tired. How do i stop feeling like it hurts my soul to continue? "
Any ideas?,"sry for my english
Okay so first of all I don't know If I'm posting this in the correct subreddit but this is the only one I've found so far related. If it's not then you can remove it but can you redirect me to one where it should be posted?
I thought about posting for a while, but i didn't, but now i do.
So I'd like to know the best or a good way to commit suicide.
Now I don't live in the US, i live in a europian country.
I've heard of all kinds of methods, including many different products.
But It's not legal to buy a gun, and I don't really understand how you can get acces to these kinds of gases and pills, I can't really get them, i never really heard about any ordinary person just buying them either.
I thought about the jumping method, but there isn't really any tall buildings around here, that i can just go in at least, i know of one but a few people fell from that and they survived so it's not really good.
There are a few bridges but they are very low also, at least compared to the US, I don't really understand the physics behind water.There's a big one but it's really far away, and unfortunately I don't have the ability to get a driving license,and I can't imagine a scenario where a stranger just takes me there, but i refuse to use pulic transport.And apparently under the big bridge there's grass so that can modify some things as well.
I've tried hanging a couple of times, but it didn't really work, at least as far as I understand I must have been doing something wrong.
But in general there never seems to be an agreement whether hanging is actually efficient or not.
I actually don't mind pain all that much, so it's not a primary concern,but I'd be really happy if there was a painless and preferably quick way, but i refuse to use blades and fire.
Also I have to ask what about trains?
I know what the general opinion is, but I'm a 270% selfish person, so.. yeah I'm really not into limiting my options. I am very sorry.
A train usually goesy by not far from here, so it would be kinda convinient FOR ME (obviously), but again i don't know the efficiency.
Thank you very much for the advice, Im trying not to violate any rules, but we'll see about that i guess.
Thanks!edit: also i should mention I'm not going to read the replies regarding loved ones and a better future, im sorry, but I just cant handle them."
Grad School has made me severely depressed and i fantasize about death daily,"i have told my husband 2x and while he seemed concerned in the moment, he never brings it up or asks me if I'm okay. i love him and he is a good person but it makes me miserable that the 1 person who should care doesn't do anything and everyone always tells you to talk to your loved ones about this kind of thing but that didn't work for me at all. I don't even know why im posting here ...i just want to tell some one that i feel like im losing this battle with my mind and i am afraid of myself and what i might do"
Tired.,"I've spent the last 8 months living in hell. Divorce. Losing my son (in the sense I havent been with him in months and have no means). Loosing my home, and job. Many many friends. I've tried several times...
Medication hasn't helped, counseling hasn't helped. The hospital made it worse. Made me feel less than human for feeling like life is meaningless.
Every time I fall, I think I'll hit the bottom, be done falling... but it never ends. Every day is a new pain. Every day. Im not planning far ahead, only far enough to say goodbye to my son. im here to stay sane long enough to do even that honestly... If I could say goodbye and I love him to him now, I would be gone the next minute."
"Can't stand being autistic, I don't know what to do","I'm 24 and have Asperger's syndrome. I go to college, trying to get a good job, finishing my associates, wanted to go into computer science but I'm so fucking stupid I'll probably fuck that up too. If I'm not in school, I'm working. I don't really have ""friends"" just acquaintances that come into my life when it's convenient for them. I feel like such a freak, I can't pick up on simple communication cues and never know how to express myself emotionally to people. When people are sad or crying to me and expressing themselves, I never know what to do or say or even feel, I can blame Asperger's all I want but that won't change the fact I feel like I don't belong on the same planet as normal people do. Medication just makes me a robot, so I stopped. People say I'm hilarious but that's not a trait that will get me anywhere in life and it can be hard when I'm usually sarcastic and people just ""don't get it"". My gf of 5 years cheated on me and hasn't spoken to me since I found out, the one person I felt safe with is now gone from my life. I feel like I'm in some sort of glass room just watching everyone else and no matter what I do I can't break the room due to genetics and my failure of a mind. Should I just end it so I can quit ruining people's lives and hating my own? I'd rather hope for a second life where I can actually enjoy being a normal person than continue living as a failure.   "
Always praying and wishing for death,"This is going to be long, I don't know what to do or where to go. I've never felt so lost in my life and I know all the sequence of events that got me here but I was too young to control them and the adults around me too foolish to see them.I don't know what I want from writing this but I need to vent, I've cried myself to sleep the last few nights and I only want to die, I only want death's sweet embrace.If I dig deep back to my earliest memory, it's me eating a bowl of corn flakes with orange juice, there is no earlier memory, this was before pre-k (age 4). It was only when I started going to preschool that I realized something was different...Parent's talked to their kids, they hugged them, they laughed with them, they told them that they love them. It blew my 4 year old mind wide open. My parents didn't do that (my eyes are getting watery).My parents never hugged me, never told me they loved me and never gave me affection by any standard in the United States at least. I felt no love growing up and watching the people around me, it hurt.I have 3 older siblings, our age gaps range from 4-10 years. We grew up like strangers because of our parents yet we lived in the same house. My two older brothers always treated me like shit and I was the punching bag. I always got the worst of it. I never really spoke to them growing up.At school, I didn't make too many friends, I think by the time I hit first grade I was already broken. I had no one to talk to at home, my parents frequently beat me with wooden spoons, hot pans, belts (metal side too), flip flops, fists, etc. My siblings beat me...I don't remember having friends, I remember loneliness and crippling depression.In 7th grade I was introduced to public school in a new state, it was my first time going to public school. Being brown I was called a terrorist immediately and bullied. I tried to defend myself but I was scrawny and weak. I used to have so much patience at this time in my life...it was slowly erodedAt school it was just bullying and harassment. At home it was just bullying and harassment. Bullied by peers, parents and siblings I only wanted to die. I knew I wanted death for a long time at this point but I was too scared. I held a knife to myself many times but I was always too scared.I went through middle school and high school creating a facade that I was happy, that I wasn't suffering from crippling depression. Everyone believed it, including my family. Through middle school and high school I probably cried myself to sleep almost every night, I had giant bags under my eyes which I still have to this day at 24. I would pray to God on a daily basis to kill me, to end it all or help me end it all. I went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable I really believe in life after death, I believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere I don't want to go. I suffered so much in this life already, how can I kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity. I don't know what I want out of writing this but I just really want to die so badly.I felt better in college, I felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends I still felt it...my baseline emotion at this point was crippling depression.I realized I don't know how to actually make friends, I have had so so very few friends in my life. I have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing me.No one really knows but I partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak of...I'm looking for that now and I realize it's just like anywhere else. I still have trouble making friends and I really don't know how to fix it. Some people I just click with, maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest I just don't have anything to talk about, I don't know what to say. I don't want watch any sports, I don't like that stuff. I'm weird and I always try and keep that happy facade up....Lately, the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that I cant help but cry myself to sleep. I just want a friend, I just want someone to talk to, I just want to die. I pray to God that I can get into some kind of car accident where only I'll get hurt and die. I pray I can die in my sleep, I pray to have a heart attack, to get cancer, to die some sudden death or get run over. I pray that God takes the breath from my lungs.I don't love anyone on this planet, I have no desire to stay here. I have no attachments. All I've ever wanted in this life is to have my own family, someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly. A real family, not the bullshit hand I was dealt...but it's hard.My parents let me eat like garbage growing up, we never went out to eat but all I really ate was cheese and pasta. My body never properly developed if you look closely. My head is smaller than most males as is what's between my legs, they are both closer to a childs. My body even though people think I'm muscular is soft and pudgy. I am undeveloped, my emotions are a mess, my mind is a mess. I don't know what to do with my life...I don't know why I'm writing this or what I want, I just know that if I was offered the opportunity to die, I would take it in a heartbeat. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear I'll go to hell but oh my gosh...I wish someone would kill me, the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling, it hurts living each day. Everyday I stop caring about hell just a little bit because I want to leave this world... I want the pain to end, I want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit: I think I know what I want ...I mean I want friends, I want people to talk, I want to be normal but I know that takes time.For a while I used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought. I want to know how I can get out of this, I want it to stop until death can find me. Until I die, I need these thoughts to be gone, I know that's what's good for me but it's just so hard when pain and mental despair is all you know."
I want to die but I don't. Someone help,"I have depression, there are days when I don't want to get out of bed or I can't stop crying because what's the point in trying, right? I don't intend on killing myself although to be honest I've found myself thinking more and more about how much easier it would be than my life right now. To give you some background, my year started okay, going to college to follow my dream. It wasn't great, I failed the class pretty badly but I wasn't really trying that hard so I ended up dropping out of the course with the idea that I would try again and excel. My boyfriend was an amazing person through all of this, he was always there to give me advice, comfort me when I cried, give me an escape when my house was too much. This summer I had two classes but had to drop one of them because my teacher would accommodate for my special needs (which isn't that much I think, extra time on tests and assignments and no presenting in front of the class). The second class I barely passed but only because my teacher didn't want the whole class to fail. Then I started take-two of the class earlier this year. It started okay, a lot of work and not enough time but I managed to survive. But then on the second week or so I got drugged at a party and stuff happened with four people but I don't remember most of it or who knew about my mental state. After that I missed two classes because of doctor's appointments and trying to deal with related things. After I told my boyfriend he was afraid to let me out of his sight for almost a week but I didn't mind, it felt safe and I wanted that. I kept trying to do well in class but it was hard with so many distractions and I didn't feel well because of the medication I went on for what had happened at the party. My boyfriend has also been in school but his grades have been slipping. I want to tell myself that it's not my fault he's so distracted now but I just can't find it in myself to believe it. Then within the last three weeks my best friends tried to hang himself (unsuccessful), my boyfriend is becoming increasingly depressed, saying he wants me to give up on him and constantly mentioning killing himself, and I'm constantly thinking about how much easier it would be for me to just stop existing and trying and putting so much effort into making things better only to have them get worse. Now to make things better, I just got my grades back for the first section of the semester and I did even worse than last semester (and this time I tried to do better), both of my teachers think I'm suicidal and notified the school about it, my parents made me start mood stabilizer meds to try to help even though I didn't want them but I didn't get a choice. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't help anyone else with their problems, I know I need to try to fix myself but I have no fucking clue how and the only person I have to talk to only listens to my bullshit because I pay her to (therapist). I feel completely lost, everything I do ends up making things worse, I can't help anyone because I'm too broken, I can't help myself because I don't know how. The only good thing I feel in my life right now is my boyfriend but his talk about killing himself don't sound much like idle threats (the kind like if I wasn't there for him I don't think he'd be around much longer) and they scare the hell out of me. I'm so tired, I'm tired of pretending I'm okay because I'm really not, I'm tired of people caring all of the sudden now that I've stopped pretending, I'm tired of feeling like I don't have a voice or a choice, I'm tired of feeling unloved, I'm tired of life..."
This is cross posted from the depression sub. And also just because right now I'm not doing so well.,"This is my story.. I'm 34 years old. And I have lived with depression for the last 18 years of my life. Each year it gets worse and worse. There are days where I just do not want to get out of bed. There are days when i'm off from work that I do not get out of bed. I just lay in bed, eat junk, and just watch tv or youtube all day long. And frankly, that is just what I want to do with my time off. I don't want to do anything that is extra work. I just feel drained and lazy most of the time from my depression.It hurts. And what hurts even more is that I do not have anyone in my real life that seems to care. I have come out with saying that I am depressed and all I got from my mother was, ""I'm sorry you are sad."" Sadness and depression are two different things. She doesn't understand and she is not willing to understand. She told me to snap out of it. I can't snap out of it.My depression about four years ago really took a nose dive. It got horrible. And that was the day I learned about mom and dad getting a divorce. They told me about it first thing in the morning on my 30th birthday. It hurt. It hurt a lot. To tell me first thing in the morning about it all. She didn't stop there. She decided to tell me all about my dad's new girlfriend and that I also had a new half brother.I felt rotten that entire day. This is where people look at me really funny. But I found something later that day that did make me happy and something that did make me smile. Or, should I say someone.I came home from work and I turned the TV on. I sat there for a few moments in this kind of trance. Because I still couldn't believe what was going on in my life. I was suddenly snapped out of that trance as I looked back at the TV. The Colbert Report came on. I had never seen it before, so i gave it a shot. The first thing that ran through my mind was, ""Oh he is cute."" but then later on as I watched it more, I began to laugh and smile. That was the first time I had smiled that day and in a long time. I started to look forward to that feeling every day.Now, you may laugh at me. Plenty do. I've been called weird and crazy for it. Frankly, I'm at the point now that I don't care. That is the only thing I have to look forward to every day. That is the only thing that keeps me going through the day. Is getting home and watching him before I go to bed.After a while, I did develop a crush. Go figure. Anyways. on to more about my adventures here. I started to get a little bold. And I would go to the dirty role playing subs here. I would post ads for role plays of where i would want people to play him and help me play out some of my fantasies. Because I enjoyed that feeling. And also it was just something else to engage my brain in. Something that kept me focused on something I like, and not thinking about my depression more and feeling bad.But, that didn't work out the way that I wanted to. It only gained the attention of trolls. And they trolled me hard to. So hard that I'm now banned from those subs. They ruined something that I loved. Something that gave me a fucking reason to live. Because my fucking parents sure as hell don't do that.Hell, this post might attract trolls. And i know that was just an invite. To be honest, I've been crying as I've been writing out this post. I was told by someone to just start a post here and just write. Write whatever came to my mind. So here it is. Take it or leave it. Read it or ignore it. Laugh at me or don't. Chances are, someone already has."
why continue,"i have been depressed for about three years now, suicidal for two. For a very long time i saw no reason to live in the future, i just see no point. life is horrible no matter what. you're always forced to do something by someone else. why is money so important. why is education so important. you cant survive without these things. i have no motivation for anything. i got my first girlfriend and had my first kiss at 18, she made me not want to die before she broke my heart. i am currently in love with my second girlfriend, as much as i genuinely enjoy thinking about a future with her, which i havent been able to do in a very very long time, i just don't want to participate in this life. nothing is fair. everything is horrible. i am so scared that i will have my heart broken again. i just want to leave."
Boiling over,"I've always been very personal and private about my depression and anxiety, I always wanted to keep it all to myself and maybe I could help someone by sharing my story, but the time for that has never come. I'm not embarrassed of what I've done, rather scared that no one would be able to look at me the same if they knew. The first time I really tried to kill myself I took a handful of oxy and went for a drive, expecting not to be able to react (it was between 1-3am on a weekday in 2014) I drove my favorite canyon road, by the time I got to the end of the road, everything went black, and I woke up a few hours later, pulled over safely. I'm not sure why I pulled over, or why I didn't just let myself crash, but I didn't. The next year I spent most every day on some kind of hard drug, intermittently trying to OD, but it never worked. Then January 5th of 2015 after a terrible acid trip, and even more terrible interaction with people I thought cared about me, I tried to end my life. I wrote 6 letters, to my sister, my mom, my dad, and my 3 closest friends, I snorted half a gram of ketamine, drank 1/3 of a bottle of fireball, and took all the Valium that was prescribed to me that month (about 60 pills) and slit both my wrists. I was living at home with my parents after dropping out of college, my dad travels 3 or more weeks out of every month, and my mom was staying with my grandmother who was dying and if my dad had time off he'd stay with them in California and leave me with the house to myself. My parents never knew of my addiction or how bad I had gotten. Back to January 5th, my parents were home but used to me not leaving my room for days at a time, and my mom busts into my room at around 3pm on the 7th and pulls open my blinds and yells that it's time for me to do something, anything, and storms out of my room slamming my door. And as unlikely as it may seem I came to. My sheets were bloody, the letters still sat on my night table next to my bed, and my mom didn't even look at me or the slew of drugs and alcohol on my night table. The only thing I remember from my attempted suicide was becoming very cold and seeing nothing but black, until I saw just my own face emerging from the blackness, I didn't interact with myself, I didn't say anything, or rather don't remember saying anything, and the peaceful darkness of me staring at my own face in darkness was interrupted by my moms voice of her barging in my room. For the next 4 months I went back to school, and wore long sleeve shirts, well into spring break, when I finally slipped, my family and I went out for family dinner and I wore a long sleeve sweater, and as I reached across the table to grab something, my mom saw my scarred wrist. I had been waiting for them to heal enough so that I could get a tattoo to cover them up, but they were badly scarred and unsightly. I never told anyone what happened that night, other than telling my mom I tried to kill my self months earlier. I have never been afraid of death, nor the repercussions of killing myself until my family sat me down and each of them told me how it would have affected them, and how it would affect everyone that knew me. This didn't scare me, but made me feel terrible, made me feel even more like a burden, and I knew I'd never be able to escape their fears of me attempting again. For the next year I got daily check ins from my family, which inevitably slowed as the year progressed, and finally the anniversary was upon me again, and overwhelmed with emotion, I attempted again, however this time I just tried to OD on sleeping meds and barbiturates. I had been living with my best friends and their girlfriends in a house near my school, and when I attempted I believe this was the closest I got to death, I started having extreme trouble breathing, my heart was racing, my vision was blurry, and I was terrified. I made a last ditch effort to throw up some pills, after I made myself throw up I passed out in my shower in my room. Again, never told anyone, and no one was the wiser that this had just occurred. I'm not sure how I could help anyone with this story, but I always hoped that maybe I could help someone feeling like they can't go on, like they are afraid every day that they could take their own life, but the truth is I still feel that way. After all the therapy I've gone through, after all the experiences that have gotten me here, I still have a daily thought about how I'd do it again, about how I won't fail next time. All the while trying to be there for my friends in their times of weakness, and there for my family to try and be the goofy light hearted son/brother they'd known. It's just not me anymore, and it's lonely knowing I have to keep these things to myself, so I don't scare or put stress on those around me, on those who still care about me. "
Me again; not looking to be talked out of it this time,"I posted here before and was convinced not to end it. Allowing myself to be convinced was a mistake. There are cliffs not far from where I live and I plan to throw myself off them at some point within the next week.
Not looking to be talked out of it; just wanted to tell someone what's happening. 26 years is long enough and my relatives and 'friends' will no doubt be much happier once I'm no longer there to burden them."
Everything was going so well....,"I didn't hardly have anything to eat last payday. I had enough to eat and have gas to get back an forth to work all this payday because I was getting caught up on bills. My car loan company took the money out a week early so now I have no food to eat. They gave me the ""we apologize for the glitch in our system but we don't issue refunds."" I told them I would report it to my bank as fraud. Then a supervisor got on and said if I did then if I was ever late again they would repo my car. So here I sit with no food again looking at a knife and thinking about ending it all. I just think about how nice it was last week, eating three meals everyday. I wanted to go to the food bank but they were only open till 11am and I had to work. They don't open till Tuesday and close before I get off of work. I can't stand going hungry any more. I don't know what to do."
I am alone. I have a gun. I need a dog.,"My husband is out of town to meet up with some of his fraternity brothers for a football game at their alma mater. No pets. No kids. I am too ashamed of my feelings to call anyone. I am okay 80% of the time, but I suffer from sporadic bouts of depression that include really intense suicidal thoughts/urges. There is a loaded gun in the top drawer of my nightstand for protection. My kitchen is full of knives. My medicine cabinet has an industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen. The liquor cabinet and wine rack hold enough for more than one person. I have only told my husband about these feelings once. I didn't want to. He was driving us to family dinner at my parents' house a little ways away and I started feeling the overwhelming sense of uselessness and wishing I didn't exist while looking at the cement construction barrier to my right. I was taking deep breaths to calm myself, but that isn't an instant fix. The tears started pouring down my face and my husband, not the most observant although super loving and supportive, noticed. He thought he'd done something wrong. He was worried. I told him ""Oh, it's stupid. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with feelings of uselessness and I feel like the world would be way better without me in it. I'll be fine it just takes awhile for these feelings to go away."" He assured me loves me and he would be devastated if anything ever happened to me as would my family, my friends. My coworkers would miss me and for sure one of my bosses would be absolutely lost without me.When I was a teenager I would have really vivid dreams in which I would die in some new horrible fashion every night. I am not exaggerating. It was worse when I would workout. It's no different now at 28. My mind has gotten more creative. It lures me into dreams where my life is perfect. Then, little by little, like picking flaking paint off an old door with your fingernails, it starts to fall apart. If I have a garden, the plants start to die or turn poisonous, slowly infecting the ground and working its thorny vines into my perfect house and tearing apart everything inside with an agonizing slowness I can do nothing to stop. The vines wrap around me and hold me as my husband opens the door I try to scream to warn him, but I'm choking. They stab him through the heart and slowly crush me while he slumps against the door frame, dying. Once he's dead, the vines release me, only to fell me with a similar blow before I can escape. I die knowing that the vines will claim anyone who comes near the house to check on things when I won't answer my phone or my husband hasn't shown up at the office or responded to clients in days. It's my fault. I planted the garden. In high school I had pets, lived with my parents and two sisters, and had lots of friends nearby.My family is only an hour away, but I don't want to let them know what's going on. My husband is out of town and I don't want him to worry. I have one friend in my new city and I don't know her all that well and I don't want her to think I'm crazy. I feel like someone is sitting on my stomach with one hand on my chest and the other forcing my face to look at the nightstand while listing off all my flaws, fears, shortcomings, and failures. I know what they want. I know what's in the top drawer just inches below my hand that's gripping its top. I am waiting for my sanity to come save me. I am typing this hoping that part of myself that wants to live and knows that there is too much to do to die right now shows up soon. The part that still isn't my biggest fan but holds way too much pride to let me fail too bad. The side of me that says ""You really shouldn't do that. It's so weak, selfish, and shameful. Think of your mom, think of your dad. What would they do? Would you really put them through sorting through all your shit to find some clue you didn't leave? Your husband would be so ashamed. How could he feel okay about having people over to comfort him with all this mess. You should get up and clean something. This is ridiculous. Not to mention you're overweight. What would they bury you in? None of your nice things fit anymore. At least lose some weight and clean the house first. We can revisit this then.""I need a dog. Not even a therapy dog. Just a dog. Feeding myself is not reason enough to get out of bed. Taking care of myself is not enough for me to go for a walk. My need and my husband's need to live in a clean and healthy home is not enough to move from our bed. But I do have a friend coming over tomorrow night. She'll definitely think I was crazy if I didn't call or answer the door when she got here. If I had a dog though, I would have gotten up hours ago to feed it and let it out. I am not enough to live for, but I have had a dog before. That dog was my life. I am living to get to a point in my life where it wouldn't be irresponsible or inconsiderate to get a dog. Life is too busy and uncertain right now and it wouldn't be fair to the dog, but I really need one right now. Edit: I need something external to push me from this place because that gun is really close, and I am having trouble talking myself out of this. EDIT2: So, woke up totally fine. Thanks everyone who talked to me last night. Hopefully I won't be back here anytime soon posting about my suicidal thoughts. I plan on coming back to help others going through similar situations. "
I need some help please.,"I'm saw my therapist today. I'm seeing him again tomorrow morning. I don't think I'll actually do it, but the thoughts are very loud tonight. I keep dreaming of doing it. Music helps me a lot. Can you please suggest some good songs to help get me through the night. I tried to build my own playlist but shit just got dark so quick. I want something empowering, I don't want to listen to songs that remind me why I want to disappear. Something to help pull me through tonight. I feel stuck. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to do it. I don't want to do it. But I'm really fucking tired of everything. I feel trapped. Like stuck in a constant loop of thinking about it and wanting it and pulling myself back at the last minute. I'm scared in that moment it'll get too much and I'll do something stupid.I will call my therapist if things get too bad, but I really want to do this on my own. I have no one else. I wanna listen to music and play BotW and just wait till tomorrow's appointment.Thanks.Also, if there is a better place to post this let me know. I'm not trying to be dramatic. "
Possibly going to make attempt #1727272 soon,"I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to a hospital, my whole life since the age of 14 has been nothing but fucking hospitals. Literally all I want in life anymore is to move to Rhode Island. That's it. But I doubt I can get another job because I've fucked up my resume really badly from constantly leaving jobs, and I'm only getting about $300 from SSI. I can't fucking take living with my dad anymore. Every single one of my days is the fucking same: Alternate between being in bed on Facebook and riding my bike. Maybe walking around that same damn mall sometimes. I have no hobbies, because I'm not good at anything. I don't even have the attention span to watch shows. This is my entire existence. My girlfriend is pissed at me because she's not making me feel better. I don't know what to fucking do anymore, and dying would be so nice compared to this hellish monotony. I could finally end this lifetime of endless suffering. I don't see amother way out. "
Anyone else feel like they're treading water until they actually do it?,"I've set a date, my birthday on the 2nd of October and I am so determined to carry it out, but because I know that date is coming up soon I'm so fucking scared. I can't take the pain and everyday I say to myself ''one more day, maybe tomorrow she'll come back to me'' but the longer I'm without my ex-fiancee, the harder it becomes to hold on. Each day is torture and I'm just so lonely without her. I don't wanna hurt her, I don't wanna hurt my family or friends, but I feel like it's my only way out. I love her to pieces and I can't live without her, I'm just so scared of doing it."
"In july, you guys helped me through a suicide attempt. I survived and in a better better place, what do I do with my note?","My whole life changed after my attempt for the better. Im on the path to recovery and things are slowly getting easier. I probably wouldnt have made it through my attempt without the help of all of you on here...thank you, from the bottom of my heartMy suicide note has sat at the bottom of my underwear drawer for nearly 2 months now. (Edit: i read it again just now and sobbed, I cant believe I was in that place. The difference between then and now is staggering)I have no idea what to do with it...keep it, burn it, spit on it? Did you guys have notes after an attempt? What did you guys do with it?"
Nothing makes things better,"I am 26 years old jobless guy who didn't finish his master's degree. Ironically I actually completed more credits than required but I got C grades or lower in 4 subject. As a result of universities policy I was dismissed without the Masters degree. Because I don't have the degree I can't find a job as I'm in a foreign country. So I just stopped caring about career, working etc and haven't worked in like 2 years. I skated by, borrowing money from friends and while I paid most of it back, I still got a lot of debt. So I stopped talking to people at all and stopped going outside or pretty much doing anything, just get up do stuff on laptop eat go to sleep. And now I'm absolutely hopelessly unable to pay rent or even buy food. My mom and dad fight all the time and dad has mentally emotionally even physically abused us for years. I don't ask money from them coz well I don't want to and they won't give it. Mom will but not Dad and since Dad doesn't give her any money she has to work so I can't ask her. I haven't told them of the terrible situation I am in. I think they do care but mostly because it will make them look bad. I don't find enjoyment in any of my old favorite things or any present or future stuff. Many of my friends have found success in jobs relationships etc but since I am so ashamed of myself I can't even talk to them, not even to congratulate them. No big tragedy has hit me like for example hurricane Harvey wrecked Houston, people died, they lost their house, cars, pets etc but I was completely unharmed by it. Walked around aimlessly at peak night time but no thug or junkie has ever attacked me stole my wallet phone  etc stuff like that. I want to end this hopeless life but I simultaneously think it is both pathetic and beyond my strength to do so. Don't think I'll ever be able to jump in front of a car or train coz well I figure if I get hit and don't die straightaway I'll be a crippled loser which I believe is worse than just loser. I am so done. "
I don't know why I keep going,"I've had depression and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I can barely function on my own, but I've found I can pull myself together when I'm around others. I fall apart when I'm alone. I only really talk to 5 people, all of whom have other friends and lives. I can't constantly be around them, but these thoughts come back whenever I'm alone. I'm so unhappy with myself that I can't be alone without wanting to die. It feels like it's getting more and more serious. I can't get meds or therapy (it's complicated, I literally can't). I don't know if I should even fight it any more. How can I go on, or should I?"
hello?,ive been strugling with depression for the past 3 years and ive been suicidal for 2 of those. it all went ove the edge when my ex killed herself and left me and her son. i was 15 atm and im now 19 and everyday is getting harder to get through and all night i get nightmares about either my dads abbuse the rape i went through or my exs suicide. i dont know if this will do annything but i just needed to get this of my chest. sorry for wasting your time and have a nice day
I never got to be a teenager.,"Hey everyone, hope your night has been better than mine. I've been lying in bed for about 4 hours now trying to think of a reason to move but I just cant find one. I'm 20 years old and I disgust myself. I can't get a job and my parents pay for my apartment and my college. They think that I have a plan to use my major and that I'm having the time of my life at this school but the truth is I'm completely lost and alone. My grades are fine but I'm not on track to graduate or get any internships (a death sentence in todays economy). I also spend every night locked in my room alone listening to my roommates and neighbors party. In a year or so I'm going to have to take care of myself completely: get a job I hate and be even more isolated than I am now. I don't want that. I want to be a teenager again. I spent my teens being a nerdy straight edge loser. I never went to dances in high school, never asked out any of my crushes, never went on a spring break, never got drunk in college, never rushed a fraternity, never made friends in the dorms, never got to experience young love.I missed out on so many parties, events and memories during the most important decade of my life and its left me to be an emotionally stunted shell. I have nothing to look forward to except work and loneliness because all of the best things in life passed me by. Whenever I remember all the old young adult stories I read in middle school I can barely believe that I'm actually older than all of those characters. I feel like a child, scared and helpless. I'm weak, unattractive to women and made fun of by guys. Its all my fault for letting my teens escape unchallenged. I'm soft, lazy and completely outmached by the amazing, beautiful and motivated people that surround me.If I had just done things differently for the last few years I probably could have had everything I want: friends , sex, career prospects; but instead I'm burning away my parents life savings to sit and cry alone on a squeaky bed. I dont want to live this life anymore; I just want to go back, I just want to make things right. "
i'm 15 and have suicidal toughts since 9. How tf do I do something with my life ?,"I don't know why. I don't know how.
I hate the world, I hate the peoples, I hate myself. I hate my culture, I hate what I am doing.I'm supposed to be intelligent, and I'm just sitting here, with no idea of what do I do next. I can't have 10 mins without thinking about killing myself. And fuck all those peoples who are making me guilty of being depressedI stopped all that was ""negative"", no more scarification, no more hunger-strike. Just depression jokes.
I hat my whole family. I hate my whole city, my country, all the fucking stupid peoples who don't realize how it's such a mess.
I'm not even english. i'm fucking frenchThe only reason I'm not killing myself is my friend. He is suicidal. I don't want him to kill himself, so I don't kill myselfI don't even know what I'm doing here. Fuck that shitsry for bad english lol im so funny"
This may possibly be the final straw.,"Now before we start, I am getting help. I�۪m slightly suicidal so that�۪s why I�۪m posting here. My girlfriend (of 1 month but that�۪s besides the point) broke up with me yesterday because I�۪m ���cold and mean and possessive.�۝ She said I�۪m not healthy for her and I understand why. She�۪s a lot like me in many ways. Depressed, has anxiety (worse than me in most ways) and likes a lot of the things I like. Even though it�۪s a short relationship I felt a DEEP, DEEEP attachment to her. I would say I�۪m in love with her. She even had the same feelings. But I fucked up. I kept making jokes saying I�۪m gonna kill myself and kept doing it even when she clearly didn�۪t like it. I wasn�۪t doing it for the attention really. It was a way for me to cope I guess. I also kept poking fun at her for when she accidentally called me one of her friends names. I�۪d pretend to be upset whenever she would say she thought someone else was cute(even when i could tell she wasn�۪t serious). She loved me as much as I loved her. I still think she does too. The day before we were cuddling and saying we love each other every 5 minutes. This wasn�۪t really like her at all. During class today I kept catching her glancing at me from time to time. I�۪m going to give her space for a few days then try to talk to her in person. If this fails I think I�۪m done with life. You can say what you want about it being really short of a relationship or how I�۪m young and I�۪ll get over it (I�۪m 18), but I really don�۪t think I will. I don�۪t want anyone else but her. I fucking love her with all of my strength, heart, the passion of a million suns, whatever. If she says no I�۪ll respect that but I will probably be done with life. "
No more. Just no more. It is time.,"I'm just so tired of it all. Misery, poverty, a terrible home life, mental illness, and the inability to improve anything simply due to lack of money.It's clear that I can't escape any of it in life. Death is the only escape. There's no other way. I have a method picked out. I want so badly to go through with it."
I've lost my motivation to keep going,"I've lost all my friends and I'm having a lot of issues with school. I have nobody to go to other than my parents and because of that, I always feel really lonely. I'm not confident in how I look at all and the thought of people looking at me and thinking about how weird I look is incredibly stressful and just makes me not want to go out at all.I have had back pain for months cause of a surgery and my depression makes me never want to exercise or even get up out of bed. I'm in pain every day, physically and emotionally, and I don't know how much longer I can take of it. I've dealt with my depression for a couple of years now but it's starting to break me.I know I should just stop complaining and be grateful for what I have, but it's so hard. I feel like I have nobody to talk to anymore and I'm always in so much pain that I never want to get up and do anything. School stresses me out so much it drives me insane. I don't know what to do about it, or about anything.I know this sounds stupid I just don't know where else to go, I'm sorry. My parents are really the only thing that has kept me from killing myself. I want to live for them but it's really hard to keep going, and yes, they do know I'm depressed.I haven't used reddit much, sorry if i screwed this up somehow."
Just want someone to listen,"I've had thoughts of suicide since I was very VERY young. I hang in for my mother and sister. But im fucking tired. I just wanna lay some shit on the table. Get it out of my head, off my shoulders. I've tried friends, family, therapists. Maybe a stranger can hear me. I'm so stuck inside of my own head all the time I miss entire conversations, whole days go by that I can't remember because I'm locked in with myself. I have to get out. I'm not begging, but if someone could just fucking hear me I think I'd feel better. "
i don't want me here and no one else does either,"so i guess i gotta just debate tacticsive already failed a few times with sleeping pills, and i'd just  get screamed at if i failed with thembut physical manners are just so much more shameful to live with if i fail because then it's like everyone can tell at a glance i'm a useless fuck who can't even end it righti'm sorry i really do want to end it i'm sorry i just keep failing and i can't even do this right"
Big Party Tonight,Tonight is one of my best friends birthday party. I am depressed as hell. Someone tell me how to look ok when I want to jump in front of a car.
Everybody of my relatives and my friends think that I'm a very happy person but I would commit suicide this week,"No one knows who much pain i've fall for the last 6 years , I've never spoken with anyone about my pains , I don't have this one who can hear to me and understand my pains I hope I got the chance to speak with a trust one for just a half of hour before killing my self because there is apart of my mind tells me dont and I dont need to break my parents heart or left this world with shame footprintI'm sorry about my english "
Thank you to this community! And a message for those currently in pain.,"I've come to this board every couple of weeks on numerous fake accounts during the past year. The suicide hotlines i tried never answered after two hours on hold. But every time i made a post here, someone replied within the hour. And it always helped. Some of the worst and lowest moments of my life, a user or two would comment a paragraph.Would i still be alive if not for this board? I'm not sure. But even if i would be, this place made a huge difference for me. So thank you all endlessly who tune in here to help out some people in their lowest points. You are saviors.I haven't had to post here in two months. Since then, ive swam in the rivers of the smokey mountains, explored caves, seen an underground waterfall, visited beautiful art exhibits, started going to music festivals and clubs again, made new friends, traveled to great forests and beaches. And im working hard to be able travel further and see more.Before this, my depression consumed me. I was unable to eat. I would force myself to sleep by using pills the moment i woke up because i couldnt stand the pain of being awake. I was getting terrible marks in school and was on the verge of getting put on academic probation. My family life was becoming a pit of screaming toxic meat, my girlfriend was cheating on me, all sorts of extra bad things.But life can change very quickly. As fast as it all falls apart, it can just as quickly fall into place. Im glad i didnt end my life. I'm glad this board was here to prevent that. You all will be too. I promise.Thank you all (:"
What is out there,"I'm a 21 year old male. I should be in love with life. I should have groups of friends, I should be healthy, I should be out doing things kids do.I have spent 14 of the last 24 months crippled in bed, be it due to depression or the medical issue I have had reoccurring. On top of this I found a deep connection recently with a few people I have been friends with for years online.I recently got another surgery that will keep me in bed for months and it sent me into a tail spin of depression and I am going to end my life if I cannot fix how I am feeling. All of my friends seem to have abandoned me, we used to spend hours upon hours playing league of legends together and now they have a new friend group that I simply don't mesh well with but they said oh well. I don't belong with any group of people. I'm lonely.My girlfriend of 7 years hasn't spent one single day with me during any of the 4 surgeries I have gotten that have kept me in bed for months at a time, and it destroys my spirit because she has always been my rock. Life is so short for me. I have toiled for months trying to get it on track and every single time I get nearer to my destination something comes up and delivers a swift kick to the nuts and tells me, good try.I don't need responses, I don't need attention I just needed to type this somewhere that's anonymous, somewhere that people can read it and think about it. Don't let life get ahead of you friends. It sounds full of it coming from someone who is on the brink of ending themselves, but we have relationships in our lives that are important for us to cultivate, please do what you can to keep those dear to you safe and know they're loved. I hope everything goes well for you guys. If I never reply to this again I'm sorry Lydia, and I'm sorry Andrew. You guys rocked. I'm awful. Love you all."
I don't want to do this anymore.,"I feel like a failure just for posting here but I feel like I need to tell someone.I don't know that I love my wife.  I feel more like I'm addicted.  I don't want to live without her but I don't want to live the same life she wants to.  She loves having a shitload of animals on a farm to either take care of or neglect, whichever she has time for.  There's no compromise, there's no other solution.  If I divorce then I get fucked by debt and most likely alimony, if I stay then I remain miserable and unable to improve my situation at all.  I hate most of her friends, I never get to see her due to her spending days we have off together with her friend for their ""business"" (I don't think she's cheating), she throws placating statements and occasional sex my way because she knows I'm not happy but I frankly don't believe she cares.But beyond that:
- No housework (no dishes, vacuuming, laundry only when necessary, cleaning, etc... I'm the only one who does anything and I'm too depressed now to even keep up on everything so the place is going to shit)
- No farm work unless she feels like it or its absolutely necessary (doesn't feed the animals; expects me to do all the yard maintenance, building, clearing, etc...)
- Keeps a fuckton of worthless junk that she plans on ""fixing up to sell"" at some point but she's never going to.
- Has a business that she thinks is going to make a bunch of money but her and her friend/business partner are stupid about how they spend their money and their business policies are bad so they make almost no money for how much work they're putting in.
- Has two other businesses that are just complete money pits because she ""wants a hobby"".
- None of the money from her job can go towards us because it all gets spend god-knows-where, so I end up paying ALL the bills.I'm so goddamn depressed.  When I woke up this afternoon I just laid in bed and fantasized about several easy ways to just ""slip away"" because I can't just up and leave without causing even more pain to myself.  This way she gets a life insurance payout and can find someone who wants to do this shit forever and has no other ambition. And I won't have to deal with this shit anymore.  I haven't even heard from her today since she walked out of the house this morning."
Ready,"I'm ready to go.I'm sick of mentally going round in circles all while knowing I'll never be normal. I have Asperger's Syndrome, as well as chronic sensory issues. As if being born with something people equate to being retarded, I'm constantly fucked by information that doesn't bother anyone else. Because of this I can't function normally without draining myself of energy every day. One of the biggest being touch, things that I touch or touch me feel extremely irritating and ticklish. It feels like someone is molesting me, and scars me mentally. I can't escape it.I know I'll cause way more pain by killing myself, but I can't go on. I'm constantly tortured by voices in my head, touching me and whispering in my ear, trying to rape me in my sleep. They're stuck inside my head forever. So I've decided to get rid of them permanently. I feel at peace knowing this pain will be gone soon, I'm not afraid to die anymore. Peace."
This is the most I could do,"Firstly, If you are thinking of sending ���help�۪ please don�۪t. As much as I admire you�۪re noble intentions; it�۪s much too late for me. I�۪ve tried getting help it�۪s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that I�۪m not unwell enough based on my past achievement's.
Also, I�۪ve not decided to end my life right away but rather I�۪ll do it after I�۪ve tied up a few loose ends.I have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me, this will be best for me.
I�۪m autistic. I lost both my parents, I was an only child and therefore I no longer have any family. I was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years. She was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed. I completed my duties as her carer and her son. But these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose, no happiness, no hope. Just loneliness and a new-found drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existence.Due to my aforementioned autism, I have difficulty forming relationships (as if being gay wasn't difficult enough). People I do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don�۪t actually like me in person and so don�۪t give me a chance. I�۪m in my early thirties and I�۪ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy; including friendships.
I�۪m also living with the effects of abuse; I�۪m no longer being abused however I find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from it.Rather than suicide, I see this as an act of euthanasia.
The first time I tried to accomplish this task, it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that I lived alone in.
It may not be a natural death, but to me it feels natural. Either existence ceases or I�۪ll be reunited with all the loved ones I lost; and we can be a family again. But one things for sure; this is the end of my existence that I fought to exist in to the point of exhaustion.I don�۪t know why I�۪m posting this. I suppose just so there�۪s a record of my thoughts out there somewhere.Thank you for reading."
I feel like I'm crazy,"I feel like I have something seriously wrong with me. I can't tell if it's just depression and anxiety anymore. I don't feel right. I don't enjoy anything anymore. My head feels cloudy. I feel jealous of other people all the time over small, trivial things. I can never express how I feel. When I look at my selfies I look mentally disturbed. I think that's it. I'm a very mentally disturbed person. I lack empathy. I lack the ability to see things through other's eyes. I waste all my time away doing nothing. I have no goals. I feel like I have no confidence in my abilities. Physically I always feel awkward, as if my muscle memory doesn't exist. I'm very non-caring towards other people, my family included. Idk. I need to see a professional. I feel so powerless, as if nothing in my life matters. I often worry about my health, wondering why I have heart palpitations all the time and why I feel like I constantly have cold/allergy symptoms.  Honestly, I'm afraid to go to the doctor's because I'm afraid I have cancer or some terminal illness. Sometimes I worry it's cancer in the brain, and that's why I haven't felt like myself for so long. I have very little control over my thoughts. I have very little control over my facial expression. I just don't know. I'm religious. I believe when we die, we go somewhere better. With that in mind I just think what's the point in living if I'm eventually just going to die anyways? And in all likelihood that death will be horribly painful and gruesome. Life just feels like I'm waiting for that horrible, terrifying moment. Nothing seems to matter. When things do seem to matter, they just don't stick. I can't stop questioning my worth, skill, and abilities. I feel like I can sympathise with people who commit mass shootings. Not that I would ever do something so terrible, but I feel like I know how those people felt. They felt useless and defeated; nihilistic and jealous, filled with a kind of hatred towards the world and other people, not because of something other people did to them, but because of the toxic feelings other people's lives brought about within themselves. They stopped caring. They snapped. I will never snap. But I sympathize with how those killers felt. The average person writes them off as crazy. They weren't crazy, they were just mentally weakened by their own thoughts and life experiences. Idk. This whole thing is nonsensical. It feels like today there is a boulder resting on my body; a metaphysical boulder that only I can see and feel. "
Welp. This is the end.,I am such an idiot. I am such a colossal idiot. I had a perfect job. Was about to get hrt and see my fiance'. And I blew it. I fucking blew it. I took a purse out of a trashcan now the company wants me to pay it back and fired me in the process. Ontop of my already massive student debt. I was also thoroughly humiliated through the process.This is it. Either tonight or tomorrow I'm taking a gun to my head and pulling the trigger. I will never live this down. I can't pay it back. And it'll probably be on my record forever. So I guess this really is the end. I fucking knew things were going to well. I knew things were going to well for me not to fuck it up in some colossal fantastic way.Goodbye. I'm done. This is just where it stops. This stupid story has gone on far enough. I'm getting rest.
"Here I go again. Expectations are a bitch, I'll tell you that.","Just got my grades for the midterm and it fucking sucked. This is my third times repeating the first year of college. I'm a fuck-up, no other way to look at it.I've written down reasons for myself on why killing myself soon is better than trying to slog through life:I won't let people down anymore, won't be disappointing elders and friends. Everyone thinks I'm smart and have what it takes, but fuck that. I've been stuck in the same level of college for so long. All my high school classmates are going to be seniors next year. And here I am, stuck in first year. People will always know me as that guy who got left behind. When I was still in high school and middle school, I was an honor student. But look at me now. I'm a fucking good for nothing stupid guy. I won't be wasting my parents time and money on me anymore. I feel like staying alive is just a waste to their money, sorry for all the money they've spent on me this far. I'm a good for nothing. People have been trying to help me and I don't really appreciate what they do for me. I mean, I accept what they're doing for me but what does it even matter. Fuck. Maybe killing myself I really the way to go. People won't expect anything of me anymore. And don't say it gets better, that's what people expect been telling me for sometime but no r what I'll always be a fuck up and you can't change that. I don't know if I can even change myself. Expectations are a bitch I'll tell you that."
I don't know man,"My story is pretty pathetic. I've dug myself this social hole where I literally have no one, and no one will even approach me. I had one good friend and she got upset with me because she didn't want to hear about my problems anymore, and so I stopped bringing them up but I was struggling so much I couldn't talk to anyone and she gave up on me and hates me now. I had a girlfriend and she honestly made the world light up for me and then she broke up with me and now I've got nothing left. I've been on a downward spiral for over a year, and I just feel so alone. I have nothing going for me. I'm considered ""gifted"", but my motivation has run so dry that I can barely pass a class and I'm useless at basically any life skills. I'm going no where in life and it hurts because I just need someone to be there for me. I cry myself to sleep every night and no one could give less of a shit about me. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I can't figure out a way to make it quick and painless. I just want the hurting to end, I don't want to cause more.I don't even know what I hope to achieve by posting this. I just want to shout my problems into the void so maybe someone will hear me."
Hi,Is anyone on? I dont really want to bother anyone but i just really need to talk to someone. My friends are asleep and i doubt they even want to listen to me. So i thought why not try and talk to a stranger. So is anyone up and on?
I have tried everything and plan to give up tonight. Is there anything I could do that I haven't?,"I've tried ketamine treatments, antidepressants, even went to therapy this past week. Yet here I am, crying, hanging a noose in my closet. I really tried to survive. Is there a treatment that I've missed and would have benefitted from? "
Flashback,I just looked at the knife block in my kitchen and I remembered a time when I was 11 or 12 or maybe younger but I grabbed a knife and I was holding it on myself because I wanted to die and that was when I was a kid and now I�۪m hardly an adult and it�۪s all making me cry
I am going to try to express myself honestly because I don't know where to turn right now,"Please forgive the length.Some Context: I am 19, I am a man, and I am in college. I have been struggling with depression, social anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for 3 and 3/4 years. I have been hospitalized 3 times and been involved with some form of therapy for a large part of that time period. I attempted suicide once, and almost attempted quite a few times thereafter. I went to college at 18, and these same feelings resulted in me losing my scholarship and being forced to transfer closer to home. Damn, I'm privileged as shit.I feel like I'm going insane because of how quickly I fly from a really good mood to planning my suicide. These past few days have been rough with this chemistry lab that I keep missing. I'm almost certain that I don't have bipolar, but the thought of untreated diagnoses or of mistreated diagnoses scares the shit out of me. I'm also afraid of getting involved with medicine because I'm afraid of what my parents would think since they seem to think that I'm doing better, even though I'm still having similar problems as the last college. I also don't want to mess with meds while my attendance at my current college is so tenuous (I am on academic probation, you see). I wouldn't want to jeapordize the future while trying to get better.I am really lonely and meeting new people make me extremely uncomfortable. I am so afraid that they would reject or ridicule me for experiencing depression and anxiety as incessantly as I do even though I recieved positive responses from everyone I've shared this with except my parents. The social anxiety gets to the point where I won't leave my room unless I know my roommates aren't there because I don't want them to see me and my sordid condition. The fact that I am anxious makes me so upset that I think about killing myself because I don't see myself ever getting past it even though I have made considerable progress since a year ago. It still feels like I'm going nowhere, and I know that's emotional reasoning, but it still hurts so much when it feels like I've made no progress.I get furious and hopelessly sad to the point of tears when I see people who are doing better than me. Like my roommate said, I shouldn't compare my ""Chapter 1"" to what could be someone else's ""Chapter"" 20, but I feel so angry at myself and everyone else when I see people who seem socially capable when I can't even look strangers in the eye on the way to class. I also feel so upset when I hear people tell me that it will get better because they really don't know. It could always get a lot worse, and then I could finally kill myself. They sound so goddamn presumptuous, as if they don't know how condescending that sounds. It makes me feel so broken and stupid.Can I talk about how hopeless I feel? I am really concerned. As you might imagine, I don't have a significant other. I feel hopeless about ever forming that type of relationship with someone because my depression, social anxiety, and suicidal thoughts are things that will never go away for me, and I'm pretty sure that no one would want to start a relationship with someone like that. So, it follows that I have thoughts that I will never be able to form that kind of relationship while being honest about how I feel to that other person. I feel like I'm a quivering baby that no one could feel anything for but pity. I feel like I'm a broken egg trying to hold myself together, and I'm pretty sure that I have to be more secure in myself before those kinds of relationships. Of course, the perpetual nature of my bad mental stuff leads me to believe that I will never be secure in myself and that I can never get a significant other.I know I'm young, but I've made a lot of mustakes that make me wish I had jumped off of rhe Manhattan bridge when I had the chance.I am really afraid to talk to my two close friends about this because I want to respect that they have problems, too. I also get distorted thinking that leads me to believe that no one really cares and no one wants to hear my problems. I mean, in a way it is true insofar as no one wants to hear the bad news of ""Hey, I'm faring very poorly,"" but I also understand thay they'd rather recieve that bad news than the worse news of ""Hey, your friend/acquaintance [temporalindifference] has been found dead by suicide.""It's just so damn hard for me to think clearly when I feel as bad about myself as I do.And of course, as with a lot of ""my type,"" the only time I can escape any of these feelings is ehen I'm playing video games, masturbating, listening to music, or painting my WH40k figurines; e.i., things that I can do alone. And, as we all know, none of these are good reasons to live in themselves, so I get this creeping sense of delaying my inevitable suicide.I remember seeing this question on this therapy intake form that said something like ""How likely do you think you are to die of suicide?"" It was a question I have never heard before, and maybe I misread it. I feel like my suicide is as inevitable as my depression is chronic."
It's just too much to bear anymore. I'm too weak for this. I was not cut out for living in this existence.,I was never meant to be here. I don't belong here. I am too weak. There is no place for me here. My emotions are too strong for me to bear... I cannot go on living like this... the pain is too much. I am nothing. Fuck everything. Make it end please.
So I won't turn 27 like thisee,"I tried and tried to get better turned to numerous therapist, went into the hospital and had several medications. When I am feeling better shit happens, I have lost my splen, have Morbus Meniere, depression, anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. I get been rejected by all the girls I ever liked. I got beaten and mentally abused  as a child on a daily basis. So what's left for my then to accept the pain won't fade. I gave me self another year last year, worked my ass off. I failed. Now I'll hurt my friends. But enough is enough."
I'm trying to die,"I've written on another thread about my recent break up, and I just simply cannot get past it. What even is the point anymore? All i can think about these days are different ways to die. I get in a taxi or a bus or a train I chant to myself ""kill me kill me kill me"" I intentionally walk slowly when I cross the road, I stare down buildings looking for the best way and the quickest way to end my life. The only thing stopping me right now is knowing how devastated my family will be when I do it. But honestly, all i want to do right now is end the misery that is going on in my head. Today i found out my ex is on tinder, barely a week after the break up. we were supposed to get married, we were engaged, we were living together but everything is just gone, just like that. Wow, he truly can't wait to replace me. Am i that bad? "
"I'm so scared to kill myself, but i see no other way","im a 17 yo boy.
i always help anyone, i always give everything what i have, i never asked for help or anything. im trying my best but im still fucking useless.
i want to die so hard since years, i have nothing to live for. i hate everything and everybody.. nothing, seriously NOTHING and NOBODY interests me, i cant get excited about girls anymore. human body is disgusting, i just cant think about sex more, it makes me sick
i hate talking because everybody so fucking selfish, i just stopped talking with people some years ago, they ask but i know they dont really care about what im saying. thats why my environment thinks that im a totally okay quiet kid and they will be surprised when i kill myself.
i feel that im the worst, i dont think i deserve to have relationships with other people, i deserve to die slowly and painfully, i hope i get cancer or something like that. rarely whenever i think someone is nice and may she/he can be my friend or wtf i always think about how many other friends/girlfriends/relatives/family members she/he can have and im getting feel myself useless because why that human want to me if they can have other friends who are definitely better than me!?
thats why ive got nobody who loves me, except my mom, but i hate her because she loves me.. i didnt ask her to take care of me! she's just making my life harder, i can be dead now years ago if she didnt make me feel remorse about it. im waiting for my mothers death, so then finally i can kill myself easily.
i never asked for attention and i still dont want it, i hate it! but at least one time in my life i want to do something selfish: suicide. and i just cant fucking do that. im so scared about it, i make plans about it every night, im begging for a surprise accident or whatever what can kill me, just kill meactually i dont need help, i dont want to get better, i dont need answers, i just have to tell someone what i feel, so thank you.
i know i will kill myself by a train, i just dont know when. maybe today or tomorrow but i said it 2 months ago too, so maybe i can survive 2017, but when i finally have one more reason for it, i will do it."
I don�۪t really feel anything. I just want to die.,I can�۪t do anything I need to do and I think it�۪s more practical to give my body back to the earth than to live on hurting it more and fighting off the inevitability of death. I crack smiles and I participate in meaningless conversations with my parents and people at school but it�۪s not me it�۪s just the shell of the human I�۪m keeping alive when the actual person inside me wants to die. I cried when I first considered seriously killing myself again but I cried for maybe 30 seconds and then I went numb and now I�۪m here. I�۪ve already attempted to take my life once. In the year following i has motivation to live. I had emotions that made me feel warm and strong and now it�۪s all gone and I just feel like a void. I�۪m losing weight because I have no desire to eat and no motivation to get help from family or friends or medical professionals. I don�۪t even know how I�۪d bother to kill myself because I�۪m in such an apathetic state.
I just tried to kill myself,"I tied the belt around my neck and the top of my dresser, I wanted to know if I could go through with it. I'm too tall to fully hang so I relaxed my body and closed my eyes. Within a couple of seconds my arms and legs were tingling and I started to fade out. My brains natural reaction was to stand up and save myself. After some googling I found out that if I had waited just a couple more seconds to go unconscious I would've died within 20 minutes.
No one would know, I live alone in an off campus university apartment. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and said she just didnt want to be in a relationship right now and that down the road we could try again. I know she's lying. I'm overwhelmed with University things and I can barely take care of myself at my apartment. I wish I would've gone through with killing myself. It's the only solution I have to all my problems. "
"Greedy, cynical, pathetic, moody, selfish, asshole.","I am Matt I am 19 years old. It all stems from incest done to be my brother growing up. But at this point it can�۪t be changed, my views are part of me, theirs nothing for me, nothing to be done or changed. I have tried therapy, group sessions, religion , but the only thing that numbs the pain, is drugs and alcohol. From the age of 12 I remember thinking I don�۪t know when, or how but I AM going die from self inflicted suicide. And it�۪s the truth. That�۪s also around the time my substance abuse issues started. I don�۪t know why I can�۪t let myself be happy. I hate myself to the very roots. I hate people, and I can�۪t stand their company, I can�۪t stand even looking anyone in the eye. I can�۪t enjoy simple things like sex, or conversation or a beautiful fall day anymore.At the end of the day we our all just self righteous apes. We fuck, we eat, we sleep and we look out for ourselves. Like I said, I have a substance abuse problem. This started from an early age. Marijuana was my drug of choice and I thought I was happy, hell maybe I still would be if I could enjoy it, but it changed on me. So now I drink heavily and will use pretty much any downer I can get my hands on. What bothers me the most is am with the most amazing girl. I love her. But yet I resent her. I resent her for expecting more of me, I reset her for not letting me sit in my room and play video games all day. The funny thing is in my fucked up world I don�۪t think she�۪s good enough for me. Me the socially inept, angry, bitter, retard. She deserves so much better. And I wish I could give her more. I rely on my mom and grandparents for everything. And in return I am a moody, irritable asshole. I have know aspirations, know hope for the future. The only things I really care about are my dog and cat. And yet I have failed them both, because they both have gum disease that I will rely on said family members to fix. I often fantasize about being gunned down, suffocating myself, hanging myself, or blowing my head off. It calms me and gives me solace. I hate who I am. I hate the world I inhabit. I hate that I treat all the amazing people around me like burdens on my back. I am not meant to be here man. That is all I know. Sorry to ramble. "
I (16F) need someone to talk to.,"I don�۪t feel comfortable posting the details, but I think I�۪m ready to talk to someone about it. Please PM me or comment if you�۪re versed at all in the effects of rape, incest, sexual abuse, etc. [Don�۪t message me if you�۪re looking to get off on a kid being taken advantage of. Find your porn somewhere else.] I�۪m really struggling, and I can�۪t do this alone anymore. I can�۪t stop fantasizing about ending it all right now but I know it would be a mistake."
"My last attachment is gone, so why shouldn't i?","My ""best"" friend has stopped giving a shit about me. What I thought was the closest friendship I've ever had, one that would actually last for once, has crumbled, for no reason... Other than I'm a sad worthless useless piece of shit, it's a miracle she ever cared, completely illogicalMy ""best"" friends always leave, I should be used to it by now but.... How TF you supposed to get used to betrayal? I thought this time was different, I never felt so close. I was actually coming out if my shell and... She dropped me, like the worthless sack of flesh I amAnd I'm supposed to what just try again? Like a shitty fucking video game? Oops game over try again next time? I don't think I can anymore So someone please, why TF shouldn't I? She won't care, noone cares, i could delete myself out like a useless redunant leftover line of code and noone would miss me, everything would keep running. And What's the point of living the same painful 6 months over and over again? Hope caring and betrayal, hope caring and betrayal. Why should anyone live through that?"
It's all downhill from here (long),"I went to one of the best high schools in my state. I got okay grades, made some friends, and generally just tried to get through school unnoticed. I was depressed for most of high school, but I never had any suicidal ideations, just self-harm. I went to a local college where I was going to study engineering. It wasn't my first choice, since STEM subjects aren't my specialty, but it was what my parents suggested, so I went with it. I did poorly in my first semester and had a few suicide attempts. I stood on a balcony of a ten-story building several times, but never got the nerve to jump. When I came home for Christmas, my parents were mad at me for hiding my poor grades from them, and I became even more depressed. I stayed in bed most days during the spring semester, and ended up trying to overdose in April. I panicked and called 911, ending up in a psychiatric hospital. It was a shitty place and I hope to never go there again. My parents found out about my suicide attempt and I told them about my depression, so they decided to send me to a therapist/psychiatrist. They weren't very helpful, but I got some meds that at least helped me get out of bed. I went back to school in the fall for accounting, which my counselor recommended I try after taking an aptitude test. School went just as poorly as it had previously, though, and it was a repeat of last year's Christmas break. I went back to school in the spring but did poorly again. This summer I got a customer service job and dropped out of college. Ever since, I've been lying to my friends and convincing them I'm still at college, even though they never see me on campus.If you bothered to read that whole story, you've probably noticed a pattern in my life of things getting worse. I was always told I could do great things, but here I am at 20 going to work at a grocery store at 5 am. I don't see my life getting better from here, so I only see two possible futures. One is where I live out the rest of my life, working crappy jobs and leeching off of other people. I disappoint everyone around me for decades until eventually I die miserable and alone. Alternately, I kill myself now. Those closest to me will probably suffer a bit, mourn for a little while, but eventually they'll move on. Their lives will continue without me as a burden on them. I'll be free from worrying about the future and having to deal with my mistakes. One of these futures is much more enticing than the other, and I'm running out of reasons not to choose the latter. Just looking for some outside opinions on what I should do.TL;DR My life is awful and it's easier to die now than live in suffering for decades, so why not just end it?"
i want to die while watching a sunset on the beach.,"I'm only 15. i have friends and family that love me. but for some reason, i want to slit my wrists and bleed to death alone. i have ambitions. i want to learn to play the violin, i want to be loved by a pretty girl. i want to have crowds cheering for me. but it's not going to happen. i'm 15, and i think about death every day. i hate my family. i hate my classmates. and i hate my friends. i push people away. and i cry because i'm alone. i'm hopeless and sad. and i'm giving up on myself. if it gets to be too much, i'm going to go to florida, i'm going to find an empty beach. i'm to by a chair and some razor blades and i'm going to slit my wrists and watch the sunset. and it's almost too much."
18002738255,"I have this number memorized by heart as if it were a part of me. I dial it and sit there thinking, phone in one hand and knife in the other. My girlfriend, who's still with me, said out of the blue last night, while we're talking and joking, that we're two different people and she can't picture us being together. I then told her to think about the fact that she loved me and she asked ""but do i."" I told her she's the only one i want and I won't give up and she proceeds to ask ""but are you the one i want."" Half an hour later she says she loves me, then 15 mins after that she said don't try to change just because she doesn't picture us together. I'm sitting here with my best friends, knife and hotline. You'd love them, they kill me. I don't know if this is my last words and my goodbye to this world, but i might as well leave some form of record if it is."
"[Long, I'm Sorry] I called the National Suicide Prevention Helpline, twice, and I feel even worse.","Hello all, I would like to share my experience with the National Suicide Prevention Helpline, and get some input on both that and the original reasons I called in, but first, a little about me. I am a 27 year old college-educated female from a middle-class background.  I have a pretty typical story, physically and emotionally abusive dad and a mom that stood by and watched.  All of her emotional baggage was dumped on me from the beginning; from the times he would cheat, to her bankruptcy, she came to me to vent all of it every time.  I have looked out for her from the beginning, always putting her above myself since she had it so much harder, even getting between her and dad or her and my brother when verbal fights escalated. I became a drug addict at the age of 21 (opiates, of course), and have been battling that, too.  Anyhow, she spent her entire retirement money on a house near the beach to get away from dad, and took my heroin-addicted brother and his wife with her, instead of me, because they don't like me, even though I helped her find the house and it's her house.  She's always said I was her favorite and her best friend (although I don't believe you should be friends with your children).  She comes back to visit more often than not, which is good because I don't really leave the house, not even if I'm hungry.  As for the rest of it, very quickly, last year everyone died, and two years before that I made a plan that I have since perfected about killing myself (overdose) when my mom dies (she has an end-stage disease due to addiction), as I couldn't bear to hurt someone as badly as the loss of a child would hurt a mother.  The event that set this whole thing off was her telling me she would be home one day, then changing it to two days later, then changing it yet again.  I had a sort of epiphany, where I realized my entire life, she has told everyone only what she thought they wanted to hear, or what would keep a fuss down.  This included me.  I then realized that I was staying alive for someone who I'm not entirely sure really cares all that much about me.  There's much more, but that's the gist of it. As for the helpline, I know that they can only talk for a certain amount of time, and both phone calls lasted less than 5 minutes.  I told them I was 27, my mom had lied to me one too many times, and I have had a planned suicide for three years now.  One said ""Why can't you be happy that she's happy at the beach"", while the other said ""What were you calling about again"", and, as I repeated myself, was cut off and told that they're open 24/7.  Both of them made me feel like it was my fault and I was being selfish, I think mostly because they weren't listening. I'm obviously not upset that she's happy, I'm upset that she lies just to make things easier for herself, when she alone (well, along now with all you good people) knows how fragile I am.  I'm not going to make this post any longer; if you have any questions, please post them and I will answer as soon as possible. Thank you for reading my post.Update: Hello all, I appreciate each and every one of your replies.  It seems like those helplines aren't very helpful to some, who may just be those most in need.  Unfortunately, that's how it goes.  Someone asked why I don't leave the house often, and that's because I have severe depression and panic attacks, and, in spite of many different medications and combinations, along with therapy, none of it seemed to work in the decade between my diagnoses and when I lost my health insurance last year, so ERs are out of the question.  I'm glad (I guess?) that others have been through similar events, and grateful they could keep me company during a time of need.  Just a simple reply means so much during stressful situations, so to all those lurking, you never know how much you might help someone with one minute of your time.  Thank you."
I read something here the other night and I'm afraid it inspired me,"First time posting 20somethingF
I'm the first person to say I'm not suicidal.
But man am I depressed and feel better off dead. I read a post I found in the depths somewhere the other night... it was from
 a train operator requesting people not kill themselves by means of the railroad because of the trauma it inflicts on the operator. While I understand that, this post finally gave me what I was a looking for- how I can surely end my life.I have been struggling for normality and comfort in my life for quite sometime after my life suddenly crumbled to a pile of constant spontaneous combustion. I'm not really sure where to begin there. If someone asks I'll share but I could honestly write a book as the world turns in my universe and people would think I was a good writer. I've been seeing a psychologist for almost 3 years now. She is very helpful but she can't change my chemical imbalance and she certainly can't fix the shithole that is my life.  I am scared now though because it is sinking in more and more that this is who I am for life.
I currently live with a railroad in my backyard- I literally mean it would take all of 30 seconds to be on the tracks and dead once I heard or saw a train. The fantasy of this is so fucking freeing but don't even get started on the nightmare of its reality. Tldr: I am pretty confident I won't lay down on the railroad tracks (or kill myself at all) but I have fallen in love with the idea of doing so. "
I just want to die,"I can't take this life I just can't, every problem in my entire life all leads back to because I had to be born male, why? Why did I have to have my life ruined like this? I'll never get to transition and even if I could I would never pass and no male would ever want to date me, no one would want to be my friend because I'd be referred to as some ""freak"" or ""faggot"" because the world is a fucked place. I can't do anything at all about it, it's all so hopeless. All I can do is stay in bed all day and stay high so the suicidal thoughts aren't as bad. I can just feel sorry for myself and that's it. No one cares about me and that's because I had to be born male, I could make people like me, I wouldn't be so boring if I could've just been born in the correct gender. I just want to die. There's no hope and I'm tired of suffering. Please just make it end please "
(Serious)I�۪ve been having suicidal thoughts for the past 6 years but I don�۪t think I have depression at all . Is it dangerous to think like this on a daily basis.,"Disclaimer : I won�۪t kill myself and I don�۪t have the courage to do it I�۪ve been having these suicidal thoughts  for about 6years or so. It literally happens every day .( mostly before sleeping and waking up ) . But I don�۪t think I have depression at all. I�۪ve done those depression questionnaire and it says I am less likely to have depression. It really bothers me Sorry for bed English, it�۪s not mother language "
I'm really concerned about my boyfriend,"We've (both mid-teens) been dating for around a year, and he's been struggling with mental illness and social issues and isolation almost his entire life. He's talked to me about his past traumas and suicide attempts, and I've tried to make sure he feels heard and understood.
Sometimes he'd get really drunk and high and tell me about when he's planning to kill himself (it had been in spring, then summer, he's told me he's only stuck around so he wouldn't fuck me up) but very recently he's relapsed with self harm and been very quiet and withdrawn. I'm really worried about him, he's so much more valuable than he knows.
He's been diagnosed with several mental illnesses including depression, generalized anxiety,  ADHD, and some type of schizophrenia. Recently his hallucinations have been getting worse. He is not receiving proper treatment, every time he and his parent go to a therapist they put him on the same medication that does nothing to help him ( because he's 'at risk for addiction' so they give him the least a usable medication) so he stops taking it after a few months and goes back to self medication with recreational drugs and alcohol. I really do believe he's trying to do the best he can a lot of the time, and recreational drugs are the closest he can get to what he needs.
After most of our mutual friends moved away he's been really alone and I'm worried that's worsening things for him. I try to tell him how much I love him and how even though he might not see it that he's smart and loving and valuable. I'm trying to be there for him, but I'm worried I'm not doing enough or being smothering, what can I do to help him? I'd do anything to make him feel better. Thank you. "

Ruined my own life,"I'm already feel dead I'm just not pronounced yet...
My first memory was my dad telling me he's moving out of my house. Although still in contact with him, I'm forced by my mother and father to pick sides. One of my sisters sided with my dad, the other with my mom, and I'm stuck in the middle. Police calls and fights lasted for years and I hated every minute of my life. I had no friends I could take to about my problems but I was too young to even think about suicide.
Then I met the love of my life at the young age of 16.  My life had purpose again. I told her my whole life story and I loved doing it because she actually cared. Year after year she was still there for me and I felt like I had a reason to love. My only good memories in my life are along side her.
4 years later we broke up because I lied to her. This is when I really died. When you have no one to talk to you get used to it.. but when you had someone to talk to that is now gone forever and it's all my fault, well you don't get used to that.
So now I'm all alone in my life and plan on ending it "
When I was younger...,"I swore to myself. That i would be famous. That I�۪ll be an actor and a director. I swore I�۪ll do everything it takes no matter how difficult it gets. I always wanted to be everything. A cop, a soldier, a homicide investigator, a psychiatrist.. everything. But if I�۪m an actor or a director I could live those lives or at least tell that story as a director producer.When I went to do my diploma I swore to myself that 3 years from now on internship, I�۪m gonna do so good and impress the people there. I swore I�۪ll do everything and do my best of the best to get known for my skills. I swore i�۪ll do so good, I�۪ll be employed by the company right after internship.Now, I am on internship. At quite literally the biggest media company in my state. I didn�۪t apply for the position. In fact, I didn�۪t apply for any. I didn�۪t care where I went. I don�۪t see the point anymore. I made a horrible first impression to them. By coming to the interview late, and my first day late. I Guess one of my lecturers who had me when I was in my prime referred me to them. Of course way back when I was offered several scholarships. One of the honour student in the deans list.I�۪m quiet now. I don�۪t mingle or talk to people. I don�۪t follow them for lunch. I don�۪t anything. I�۪m either in the studio or outside filling my lungs with cancer. The first week itself the Vice President of the department I was under, asked me to do a side project. He talked to me as if he was a client and I had to produce something. He gave this job to me because he�۪d seen my portfolio. I was good. I was good before things went to hell.I couldn�۪t do it. I said yes I�۪ll take the job but.. I�۪ve lost every grain of creativity in my head to make that happen. I mean I was never that Creative but at least I was something. I�۪m horrible at what I�۪m doing here. I know they think I�۪m all talk. Or I had a lot of help on my portfolio. Isn�۪t true but, they�۪re not wrong for seeing me as an incompetent intern. I was in the washroom one day and I thought about it. I remember swearing that I�۪ll do so fucking good here. I had flair at the point of time. I was popular. Everybody knew me. It was easy talking to people. But now, everything has changed.Whenever they asked me what I wanted to do after internship, nothing pops into my head. I lie and say something to at least give them something. Last night. Last night I asked myself. Where do I want to go? What�۪s out there for me? And I realised. There�۪s really nothing.I realised that there�۪s really nothing holding me back here on earth. Nothing. Nothing I can�۪t let go of. I have no friends. I live away from my family. I have honestly really nothing. My Best Friend? The one I was always there for when he really really felt like shit? He�۪s MIA. I think he thinks I�۪ve had it all settled. But it�۪s quite the opposite.So. What�۪s the point of living if there�۪s really nothing to hold on to?"

If anybody else had my body, they'd be hot and awesome as shit. But not me-I just don't do anything.I've already planned to kill myself at college, fear's making me a little skeptical. Plus that romantic part of me that refuses to admit there is no hope for me. I'm the most useless, cowardly, ugly, worthless, pointless, fatass piece of shit I've ever met. And I don't have the ability to improve."
My head is fucking screaming at me to kill myself,When will this fucking stop
I always said that I would never do it... And I don't think I will.,"I've noticed that I enter into shallow depressive periods every other 2 weeks, plus I am doing no fap which has side effects such as depression. I think about kms  (killing myself), but I know that I'd never do it, because I have goals that precede the action of kms. This is my attempt to talk and vent about it. I just did some research in ways to kms. The following include:orThis is not a cry for help or attention. This is kinda like a report. If anybody feels the same, or you don't feel the same, then hmu. Tell me about yourself before your message me."
Lost in an endless sea of utter despondency,"How can I carry on? I have felt depressed ever since I can remember. Happiness has always been elusive to me it's an illusion that's perpetrated by greed and consumerism. School was a living nightmare that's continued on into my adult life. I try to hide my depression behind the scenes. Spending my time volunteering or being creative but behind it lies a sea of nothingness. I stopped believing that anything positive I did would have resulted in the same happening to me. I volunteer because it's the only thing that means I get to see other people who don't have to know the true extend of my worthless, miserable existence.Recently, I have become homeless and I lost my job; our only means of income while I was off sick. For reasons that I'm to o tired to explain I won't be able to find further employment. Every person, charity or organisation we approach just sends us elsewhere. Is the world so utterly closed off nowadays? I have always tried to sort my own problems out, and up until now I have managed.In light of recent events I have lost all hope. I'm no one, nothing. Just another hand reaching out from millions of others in the same situation as me. I am no one, and I deserve no help before the next person. I don't think I fit in anywhere. I am the cause for all my own problems, I have reached the very bottom of my pit. I don't have family in the area I live in, or any friends who would understand. (I am the therapist in all my circles, but if I'm having a bad day I know by experience not to bother them with it). I'm also stranded here indefinitely thanks to homelessness.It's such a struggle to put down in words just how awful I feel. I'm frightened of the thoughts I'm having, I'm sure I'd never be brave enough to go through with it. And yet, the ultimate silencing of these voices is so overwhelmingly hypnotic. I'm lost."
What is the worst that can happen if I commit suicide?,"Nothing, right? I can't regret it or experience the consequences. Even if my family misses me I won't feel that guilt. Dying is just so much easier than living. The dead don't need to take the SAT or get up at 6. The dead don't need to pretend they give a shit about the future. The dead need not please anyone.Honestly, it seems like an upgrade to a ""life"" where everything is just a fight to not be bothered by people.I'm too lazy for that."
writing my note,You can still turn this around. I'm here if you need anything.
I can't connect with people,"I don't know how to.  Everytime I meet someone I have a genuine connection with, I never realize it until they're out of my life.  I'm not trying to meet people on reddit, I'm talking about in person.  It's like the universe just wants me to be alone.  Or maybe it's just what I want deep down so that way when I finally work up the courage to kill myself, I know I won't be hurting as many people."
I need someone to talk to.,Ive been having a shitty week and as a senior in high school im wanting to commit suicide
question,what is the most painless way to commit suicide?
I know no one will read this but I'm desperate I guess,"Today I felt like throwing up in the morning stayed home from school and played games but I don't want to eat anything I have pizza from an hour ago that I never touched I don't want to eat I want to die I'm not letting myself cry or anything I looked up ways to kill myself and I'm thinking of trying to get a noose but I just need rope I want to kill myself to the point that I will steal to get the job done I have no intention of trying to make friends anymore I'm only in the seventh grade and I've been this way for years when I saw my father throw pictures at my mother getting glass stuck in her face. I have no love for anyone or maybe I do but I don't know I just have wanted to die for a long time I have never gotten help because I don't want people to say anything to me, last year someone thought I was writing notes about suicide and showed the guidance councilor and how I was treated made me feel like I was an upset 5 year old and at that time I had started to think of talking about it but after that I had no intention of telling ANYONE how I felt I DONT GIVE A DAMN ANYMORE IF YOU SAY PEOPLE LOVE ME BECAUSE THEY DONT IM NOT 2 DONT TREAT ME THAT WAY. I don't care anymore go ahead ignore me trying to get help to push myself another few days I don't give two shits so I don't expect you or anyone to read this but hell if I did it and people I know find this then I have one thing to say. Fuck you."
I don't know exactly when or how but I know for sure that the end is near.,I can't do this anymore. I don't want to hurt my family but every second of being alive is filled with agony and despair and hopelessness. I can't picture being alive for another month let alone living the rest of my life. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I have nothing anymore. I had one thing in my life that made life worth living and after 4 years he left me all alone without an explanation. He's already moved on. I need to move on too but in a different way. I need to move from this earth onto wherever I go next. There is only darkness and I can't get through this. I can't do university because my mental health is getting in the way I can't even focus and it's only been a month. I can't imagine graduating and getting a degree when I can't even pay attention in class. I try so hard but he's all I can think about and I have nothing else that makes staying alive worth it. I don't have a date picked out and I'm not sure yet how I'm going to go but I don't have much time left before I give up. Please don't try and tell me it will be okay or get better. I can't live anymore. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just so funny,"I can post on  and get no responses, no upvotes at all, but plenty of views. I post here, saying I'm gonna end it all, and all of a sudden there's an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if I need to, saying I need to reach out and get help, etc etc etc. And it's the same shit offline, too. You tell someone you're depressed and sad, and it's like 'yeah okay but when are you ?', but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care. It's all for selfish reasons, too. No one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person, but it's fine to brush off someone before they get to that point. Like. Yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point, right?"
"Not yet. Some day, maybe","First time posting. Life has hit a dead end, and honestly I'm disappointed with myself and everything. I feel like everything and everyone that once made me happy are fading. Soon I'll be an unfeeling husk. I Don't want that. I'd rather die than exist without any feeling or meaning. I'm just...teetering on the edge"

Nothing will ever be ok. It's too late for me to make any lasting changes or recover.,"In school for my dream job, and everything one after the other has gone wrong. It's too late to fix anything. Was it worth taking a shot? Absolutely. Is it worth it to continue? ..."
First time having suicidal thoughts,"My depression started when i realized what was happening with me during my childhood-highschool period. My parents were always treating me as if i m not capable of doing things or useless thinking they are doing good thing to me. They would presume that i was going to fail or trying to do the work for me. To this day they still treat me like i m useless piece of shit and because of that i had never really tried anything to do to prove them wrong because i dont want to prove anyone wrong about something like that. Recently i ve passed my last exam on my uni. I was doing a project in a programing language, an online shop. My mother was angry on my brother because he didnt do the project for me. When she heard i passed, she couldnt believe it. I have no motivation to be good at anything, ive been brought down so many times. I feel like im alone in this and its really hard when your closest cant give you support you need. They dont trust me and my skills, they keep reminding me of my ""homework"" or anything that i have to do, because they think i m unable to do it by myself, to be responsible for something. The moment i passed my last exam i felt huge depression because i expected atleast from my closest a littlebit of faith in me. I proved them wrong and that i m capable of doing something right but i dont care about that as i already said. I want to prove to myself. And i find my parents attitude extremely distracting and demotivating. Im too scared of failing anymore. I feel like i wouldnt take it good if i failed. I have no selfesteem, no faith in myself. This wouldnt bother me so much if i wasnt actually capable of doing well payed things like programing. Suicide came across my mind because i m scared of ending up with minimal wage job with all the wasted potential. I think i would kill myself if i end up like that. I ve spent my whole life thinking that everyone else was better than me. "
I'm just so tired,"I've been suicidal for a little over a decade. Everyday I think about killing myself. Without fail. Obviously on good days/weeks, I hear that thought in my head and just shrug it off. But the bad days...just keep piling on and keep getting worse and worse.I'm just tired. Tired of everything. Tired of continuing life because its ""selfish"" of me to end it. How is it selfish of me to want this pain I've been feeling for the majority of my life to stop, but not selfish of  to condemn me for feeling this way because  don't want me to die?I can't handle this right now. ANY of this. And I just feel like everything is closing in on me. This strange feeling that my life is coming to a close soon. I try to try and let it all out, but no matter what I can only muster up a few tears. After years of suppressing emotions and tears and sadness, I think I broke myself. And I think the end is in sight.All I ever wanted was to feel happy. "
My Only Reason to Live is to Not Hurt Others with my Own Death,"I don�۪t really know where else to turn about this. I�۪ve been suicidal for years now and I�۪m tired of people telling me that it�۪s going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven�۪t and things don�۪t appear able to improve in the future. Honestly, in most of my life situations it just seems like God is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness (sometimes within the hour). It�۪s starting to feel really fucked up; I just want a win for once in my life.
It dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family; which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others. I don�۪t want to hurt my mom with my death but I really don�۪t think I can do this for much longer. I know this all sounds so selfish but I�۪m just looking for a reason to live. Has anyone else felt this way before? How did you overcome it? What have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void?"
Meet them where they are,"""Here"" is one of the few ""safe"" places that people can come and talk openly about suicide without judgement and in theory, without eliciting an immediate emotional response that blocks that person from expressing their feelings.The responses here are obviously going to be different to the responses that would be received by or made by the people that come here, in real life, in a ""non professional"" face to face setting.I would be the first to admit that if I suffered a tragedy tomorrow, I wouldn't be in the best place to be here and ""be present"".And that's exactly the point.  It's the realisation that it's not that simple as thinking ""count yourself lucky""  because oh my, you don't think that people destroy themselves that they can't think like that?  That they don't scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they do?Here, it is safe and we ""meet them where they are"" we join them in their despair, even with the knowledge that we may not be able to ""make anything better"" but offering that space and time, may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for them.It is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself, to just ""be"" with somebody else and fully present to them.Amy"
I wanna just kill myself.,"I'm so tired of life, the only thing that keeps me going are small things like video games, food, and enjoying laying in bed I don't want that to end and that's it. everything else doesn't mean shit because I don't have anyone maybe a few friends but they don't understand depression or anything and they don't help at all I guess they would care if I killed myself but so many people say that and I feel like it's only because they feel bad and want to cheer me up or something but it doesn't. I have tried to kill myself before but I made sure I was only hospitalized because it was a cry for help so people would take me seriously, yet people still don't. but when I do kill myself people will all miss me and act like they cared and tried to help right? I hate school too I've failed 9th grade twice and I'm fucking stupid and I can't take it teachers treat me like garbage because they know I've failed twice and overall lowers my already non - existant self esteem. I hate how I look and how my body is its never as good as any other guys, I don't  have abs or anything special at all girls barely even acknowledge I exist and girls who I have dated either cheated on me or left, leaving me to think they just felt bad for me. my family treats me like a disappointment too I don't wanna drop out but I feel like i have to or else I'll be in high school forever. sorry if this Isn't that organized just needed to rant or something because I can't handle this for much longer. "
Please tell me what is wrong with me.,"I know I already have a lot of obvious problems like my appearance, my weight, my race, my sexuality, my intelligence, and my lack of talent or skill but is there something deeper wrong with me? When I tell my mom I love her she always likes to say ""You don't love me you just love what I do for you.""She's been saying that for a long time and she's right of course I'm 21 with no job, no high school education, and I sit on my ass all day doing nothing while she works. But I don't know if I actually don't love her. I don't know if I love anyone.I became more curious about this today when I was talking with a friend and he said he doesn't think I'll ever be happy and that I don't care about anything. He knows me pretty well so he's probably right also but I don't want to end up like that. I don't think I have a choice though.Even though I know I'm so fucked up and worthless and everything I'm never going to do anything about it. I don't even shower or brush my teeth or anything. I don't clean or cook. Maybe I just don't give a shit about anything. Maybe I'm incapable of truly loving anyone. Maybe I should just die.It's stupid of me the post this and none of you will have a magic solution I doubt anyone will even read all of this and reply but I guess it makes me feel a bit better to do it."
Can someone just talk to me?,I just want to connect and then I will be ok.
"Suicide may be a permanent solution, but 1) it is a solution and 2) I'm not looking for temporary solutions.","I resent that saying so much, ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" ugh"
"I hate my life, but I realize I can't end it.","I have an extremely good life compared to mostly everyone else. I get minimal amounts of school, I get to be on the computer the whole day. I can afford a VPS and domain. et.cYet everything is so boring. I spend my days either programming my next stupid unoriginal copy-cat application, or browse reddit. Even the forth day of school I failed to attend to because it's so repetetive.Mentioning ""school"" gets me immediately angry (less so in text form). There is nothing useful to me about how to calculate different aspects of triangles, and if I ever need to do that I will Google. I know what I need to, and I don't want to fill my already whimsy head with useless piece of shit I will never manage to forget.There is barely anything I remember about my life other that times I have been stupid or  stupid. Seriously, I was and am that weird kid in school doing my weird things. Crying after a break in winter because when I came back indoors my cheeks are rose-y and it's not what I'm used to.I have intense Asperger's. Read one thing about Asperger's, and sure enough that's me right there. I'm my father and mother's son. I secretly think I'm clever but I try to stop. I'm very rarely uncontrollably mad. But it has happened, I'm my father's son. I cry over little things, because I'm my mother's son.Every person has a bunch properties. They group together creating categories. The biggest category in me is the logical side. When I'm out in social I try not to smile at a joke that isn't even funny, or showing I'm present at all. I want to be alone, but I can't because the second biggest category in me is the ""normal"" category. I'm the awkward mixture of a distant, irritated person, and a social person (while being extremely bad at it).So it's no wonder I want to die. My life is useless, boring, awkward, and my past is even more so.... But I can't.Shit, I haven't even ever gotten unconsious except for when I'm sleeping. I live in Sweden and there are very few things I could use to end my life, and there is nothing that meet all requirements I need. I don't have enough control over my own body. I don't want anybody to live with some guilt of killing me.At this point I'm even considering doing something that won't get me killed, but hopefully ruin my life so much it opens up a new, different, course for it. If only I could get amnesia or something, because that would be the seond best alternative, after death."
"A window into my life, I guess.. this was an email I sent to someone last night. Typos probably.","Depression. Anxiety. Being alone. Not truly being needed by anyone here. It sucks. It hurts. No one needs me here. I'm just here for the sole purpose of existing. No one would care or notice if I disappeared tonight. No one bothers to ask me how I'm doing today. No one stops to ask me if I'm doing okay. Everyone has a group of friends who love them endlessly and actually want to see them outside of school and talk to them and everything. I'm just a background decoration in everyone's lives and all I need is to just be validated. All I ever wanted was... to feel wanted. This life is literal hell. It's my personal hell. I'd rather be anywhere but here. I'd rather be anyone else but me. I don't want this body. I don't want this life. Maybe if I go, people will notice. No one fucking talks to me unless they need me to listen to their problems and GOD I WANT TO HELP BUT IT SUCKS THAT I'M JUST A PERSONAL THERAPIST TO EVERYONE. JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO TEXT ME LIKE ""Hey ----, how are you feeling today?"" or a message like ""You matter to me and I need you here."" No one fucking cares. People say they do but no one fucking listens to me when I text them asking for help. My insides are crying ""save me now."" Fuck this life. Fuck this world. I don't want to be me. I feel so fucking alone. I'm so sick of waking up every single day and wishing I didn't. I am sick of crying so much. I can't fucking stand being such an outcast. All I ever fucking wanted was to fit in. I hate myself more than words could ever fucking describe and I just want to blow my face to goddamn bits with a shotgun. I feel so goddamn bad that you have to read this shit because it's not easy to hear these kind of words. I hate that I care about everyone so goddamn much. I wish I could stop. When everyone else wakes up, their nightmares end. Mine never does. Everyday I pray that I'll wake up from this dream and be a happy, beautiful child who is loved by everyone. This mental illness is tearing me up right in front of everyone's eyes and no one cares. I talk about killing myself a lot. And I bet if I were to be in the middle of killing myself, no one would stop me. I've been depressed since I was a child. Wanna know what fucking sucks about teen depression? While everyone is living the best years of their life by going to parties, making awesome memories, falling in love, and so on... I'm not. I'm wishing my own fucking life away. I'm scared that I'll just be thrown into a hospital again and be put on meds that just make me feel so damn numb. I am so ready to go. I don't want to be here anymore. Everyday is a battle with myself. It's like going to war with the enemy... and each battle ends in your bitter defeat. But you still show up on the battle field every day even though you know you're going to get your ass kicked. Each day, the wounds become deeper and more severe. You grow weaker and weaker. And then one day, you wave a white flag and it's over. Or the enemy finally kills you. Either way, you will lose to your demons. I have accepted the fact that my demons will win. And fuck, maybe they already have. I'm tired of fighting. "
I don't really understand.,"Hi. I just felt like posting my thoughts somewhere, since I'm feeling a bit down and a tad bit introspective. I've decided to share a bit of my life with the internet - which I know isn't exactly the smartest thing... but hey, I'm here. Might as well.Okay, so I've been suicidal and depressed on and off for a couple of years now. I can't exactly tell you when it started, since problems like this usually stem from childhood issues, but I can say that it certainly started getting worse sometime around grade seven or eight. Now, I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and severe depression, but I'm not currently seeing any therapist due to my parent's disbelief in mental illness. I think that they might not want to believe that THEIR DAUGHTER has any type of problem at all, or maybe this all ties into their general ignorance of things. I don't hate my parents, but I don't really believe in their values. They're racist, homophobic, my dad is sexist, and my mother uses religion to justify everything she does. Okay, back to me. Like I said, I have a couple of mental issues (with my depression and OCD probably being the worst of the bunch. My OCD is very, VERY disruptive of daily life). I'm not particularly religious but I'm not an atheist. I am a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl, and my sexuality is homosexual, though I don't like the term lesbian very much due to it's over-sexualized connotation. I like pretty boring stuff, like writing, reading, and drawing. I'm particularly interested in writing, and I would like to become an author and hopefully slow down the death process of modern literature. Yeah, I'm a stud, aren't I? I have relationship issues with my girlfriend - but I won't get into that here.Right now, in a general reference to daily life, I feel... Nothing. Nothing I can particularly say. My emotions are somewhat normal, if a bit exaggerated in the moment, but on an overarching scale... I feel fairly empty. Even so, I've been thinking about killing myself. I used to think that I gave up cutting after having a little dispute with my mother over the scabby-lines on my wrist. It's been about two years since then, and I've started cutting up my thighs on an almost daily basis. I'm not like one of those edgy teens where I ""cut because of the physical pain distracts from the emotional pain"" I think it's simply because of the dopamine reward my brain gives me for ""doing something good"". I've just always had a slightly high pain tolerance, and I find myself attracted to the pair of sharpened scissors hiding away in my desk drawer. Last night, though, I had used a different pair (they were the closest thing to me at the time) and I ended up cutting myself a nice little (and by little I mean huge) gash right across my thigh. I almost thought I needed stitches for a second. I remember the initial spark of pain, and then there was nothing. It wasn't the numbness of a severed nerve, no, it just didn't . I pressed down on it to stop the bleeding. No pain. I could feel myself pressing down, but it just wasn't accompanied by any pain. It was an almost surreal experience for me. That's got me thinking. I haven't killed myself out of fear for the pain. Since I live in Canada, with no guns, and I have no access to tall buildings, and I don't own a car or have access to any potentially lethal pills... The only viable method of killing myself that I have are the knives in my kitchen. I had held one against the throat in the past, but never had the guts to bring it down. I have imagined stabbing myself in the stomach on multiple occasions, but could never actually pull a knife. That leads me to wonder about slitting my wrists. I've heard of how painful it is... but right now I can't really find myself caring. I don't particularly care about anything at all. School is easy. I have nineties in every class and I haven't studied a single day in my life. I don't ever have any homework to worry about because I finish it all in class with time to spare. I have enough friends to satisfy me, and a girlfriend to keep me occupied romantically (though I can't really comprehend sexual or romantic attraction so it's more or less another form companionship to me), and other than my earlier sediments on my parents, I don't have a particularly bad home life. My career as an author and English teacher is but a given.In fact, for other people, I might have an amazing life. I just can't... what phrase would be correct here...? Comprehend? Yeah, I guess. I just can't  the meaning of life. Sure, I can understand the complex inner workings of society and the average human psyche - my marks in social studies and psychology prove just that. I just find myself unable to understand simple things. Why is that person happy? Why is society working away like sheep? Why am I who I am?Am I even who I am?Who am I? I'm  right...? Then why does it sound so foreign to me? Why does my body feel like it's not actually there? I will look at objects, pets, or people in my life and wonder how they have been there my entire life... They look so new and foreign to me. I can't understand them in the slightest. If I can't understand living, then how am I supposed to live? Am I a sociopath? Or am I a normal human being simply going through a phase of introspection while my brain is developing into that of an adult's? Could this be some kind of side effect of constantly reading and writing? Or is there something very, very wrong with me?I can't understand life, so I want to die. I can't understand death either, so does that mean I have nowhere to turn to? Then it comes down to the original question. Should I kill myself? I'm... I'm kinda leaning towards a yes here. I don't really know how to end something like this. Honestly, I would be surprised if anyone even made it this far. Thank you for reading my little tale, and let me tell you that each and every word here is true. These words come from the very bottom of my soul.I really don't understand anything, do I? "
"If you don't know that it might get better, why do you insist on staying?","I saw this too many times - everyone is saying to stay, but even you don't have hope that it will get better - there's even a policy on this subreddit not to do that wishful thinking.So why prolong the inevitable?"
"Even when things are going relatively well, I would rather just not live","I'm 20 years old, and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting (which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelor's).I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was about 13, but I never went on medication.I have had good times and bad times over the past few years. It seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequent.Some courses in school give me no problem at all (I aced things like financial accounting), but if I have to write anything, I will probably fail.From the time I was 9 I remember struggling to write stories in class. Now days, tell me to write a memo, essay, or even something short, and I just can't do it. I have tried dictating it, but that doesn't help. I feel I just don't have the ideas in my head to put on paper. Even when I had to write physics lab reports, I found it impossible.Due to this, I don't think I will ever be able to finish university, and I can't handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole life. I'm from Canada, but this year I'm spending a year abroad in Belgium as an au pair. I met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in Canada, and I followed her back to Belgium about a month ago. She is so amazing, and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression, and seriously considering suicide right now.I have one day a week totally free, and I basically slept the whole day. I should be exploring Belgium 0, or at least go for a walk down the street. I talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive, and is trying to help me get out of the house, but I find it impossible. Some days are okay. Yesterday I went to audition for a choir, and it went fairly well. She is a very motivated person, and I'm scared that me doing nothing could pull us apart.I also start things with a great deal of motivation, but it typically fades quickly and I want to quit. This happens with things like school, sports, work, and any other type of activity really. It happens even if it is something I really like. I just find it hard to drag myself to it.I need to figure out how to finish school, I need to figure out how to stay motivated, be able to tolerate my job, and stop being such a negative person all the time.Right now I'm really freaked out because I don't know how I can get through all of this. I don't know what I will do with my life. I have this year to figure things out, then I have to go back to Canada (we did a few months already, but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge) and face reality. I can stay with my mom as long as I am going to school.
I am thinking maybe I should push through the 3 courses, and get my diploma as a checkpoint ( I was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelor's, as I still get the transfer credits). But, I don't have a clue what I should do after that. I think I should probably talk to a professional again. I most likely shouldn't wait until I'm back in Canada, but doing it here in Belgium is intimidating.Thanks"
Good bye everyone thanks for trying,Just wanted to say good bye to everyone on Reddit. I made a post on this sub asking for help. You can probably find it by looking at post I have made. Any way I was trying to find a way to say good bye properly to the only person that has ever understood me. I did recieve some advice and some people did message me and try to help me. I was suppose to hang out with said person on the night I posted it. That did not happen. Was suppose to hang with said person tonight but I was bailed on again. It has crushed what little bit of hope I had left. Granted I was going to off myself some time soon any way. All I wanted was to say good bye to her. Any way thank you Reddit for being there. I use to go to the funny sub to cheer myself up or would just look at the front page to find new and interesting things to read or learn about. I wish I had known about this sub years ago. O well. Best of luck to anyone out there that is down and is posting on this sub. Hang tight. The people on Reddit will try and help you in any way they can. Keep doing what you do Reddit. I am at the location I had decided to do this at. Going to smoke a couple bowls and a few cigs and then I am calling it quits. The people who help on this sub keep doing what you do. Best of luck to everyone. Good bye.-Brian
I try so hard but even I know that's a lie.,"I don't know what's wrong with me anymore, I pissed away so many good things in my life because of what I feel was one persons fault and I've been dragging that ball and chain behind me for years now.I can't find the motivation to change who I am or the situation I've put myself into. Been homeless, lived in the bed of my truck, kicked out of countless houses because I'm a terrible employee and can't keep a job. I quit my tractor trailer driving job because I didn't want to be away from my family but now that I'm home, I can't muster the strength to look them in the face anymore.I was always late on rent because I just can't control my money and now I'm squatting in a run down house with holes in the roof, walls and ceiling, no plumbing and the only electricity is a drop cord from the neighbors house. It's just been me and my cats for years, going from town to town, job to job, house to house. I feel like I'm at the point where I've become such a burden on everyone around me that I can't ask for help because it seems like I'm always leeching off everyone. I sleep until I absolutely have to wake up for work because I don't even want to be awake anymore. But I'm writing this now because I had a thought to myself that if I were to just off myself now, no one would notice for weeks, maybe months despite everyone knows where I am, because no one cares to visit, to call or just acknowledge my existence. And I don't blame them."
Since July 29th this year...,"I've been thinking about suicide, and that I'll do it this year. Still haven't gone to it, but will probably do it before Christmas. I didn't know when it started, but about 4-5 years ago, I started to hate myself.. A LOT. My first suicide attempt was when my parents fought, I just grabbed a knife to stop them from fighting, saying that I'll kill myself. Yes, I'm horrible, but I actually wanted to kill myself that time. They asked me what's wrong, I answered that I didn't know, but I actually know that I hate myself. After that, my mom kept telling her friends about that, as if I can't hear it. I never attempted suicide after that, but I can still feel the depression and self-hate slipping in. Then, this year happened. I almost left home, but my parents stopped me, and I told them what I actually feel inside. I told them that I hate myself, and I just kept scratching on my arms. I told them I have mental health issues. Then, a week later, I accidentally pushed my cousin (was pissed off), and my parents scolded me. I whispered something about my mental health issue, and how it could've affected my thinking, but my parents... Didn't believe me. I HAD A FUCKING MENTAL BREAKDOWN IN FRONT OF THEM, AND YET THEY THINK THAT I;M STILL JOKING. Now, my mom said something about us being a perfect family since they're not like those other parents out there who doesn't care about their children, and she told me that they're not the problem, I am. Like... FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS, I'VE KNOWN THAT. I AM THE PROBLEM. I HAVE A PROBLEM. I actually thought that they would at least help me, but they shrugged me off. I'm a covert narcissist, and I hate that. I wanted to change, but I can't. I can't. I can't do this alone, that's why I told my parents everything I've felt, but... I actually don't trust them anymore. I don't want to talk to them about my feelings. I don't need them to understand, I just need them to listen, but I could already see that they won't. I can see it. I'm planning on leaving suicide notes on this laptop, and various other places. I'm also hinting on Facebook about it...
I just wanted my parents to save me, but I guess they can't. I'll just save myself from this misery."
I cut myself again for the sixth time in four weeks. I've been sobbing into my pillow for the last ten minutes because of it and everything else in my life. I wish the people in my life actually understood what depression is actually like among other things. I just want out.,"Why did you start cutting yourself? Make sure you keep it clean, getting an infection would suck. Many people can't really handle the concept of suicide, I think. Society is messed up, but this subreddit can help, at least a bit. "
What's the easiest way to commit suicide?,Painless and simple.
Thinking about giving up,"So I really screwed myself. I am going to completely fail a class I can't drop. I have tried moving heaven and earth to get out of this class but nothing can be done. I feel like I've ruined my future. I'm supposed to be transferring soon but I think that's all over. I've essentially lived for my GPA. It was one of the only things keeping me going, but now I'm so lost. I want to end it all even though I know it's stupid and selfish. I can't talk to anyone about this and it's eating me alive.  I don't know how long I can keep going anymore. I just want to sleep forever."
"Didn't hang myself because I got spooked out. I just think it's best for me to go, why is even suicide this hard?","I've just got home from going out to kill myself. I had scouted my area for places to hang myself for weeks now, and thought I found an adequate spot now. So I went there, past 2am, with my rope to end this misery. But upon arriving, I've noticed that the path leading to the place I was heading to was not lit by street lamps. Already gave me a bad vibe, but okay, time to turn on the torchlight on my phone. After a few metres in, I got spooked really bad by a tree I mistook for some slendermanesque man, and after catching my breath, by some animal in the bushes. That was to much for me, so I went back home. Everything seemed so unreal, like a real life psychedelic horror movie until I got back home. I'm a bit dissappointed with myself, as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery. But it's not really easy, if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first try.
I'm not even depressed or feeling sad right now, I'm in a pretty neutral state of mind. But thinking about myself, suicide seems like the logical thing to do. I will now read into death by exsanguination, as for my bathroom is lit even at night."
i wish for a friend... shouldn't that be simple?,"I'm sorry if this gets long and boringMy family consists of a dad with anger and stress issues (i live in his house), a very bipolar and aggressive mother, a sister who practically wishes I was dead, and my dog Booker. I live distanced from them and from anybody else, days consist of heading to school, returning to my room, and staying there, occasionally leaving to get food, sometimes having to greet my dad.For some insight, I'm young but i'm trans, and in Latin America we're still viewed wrong by the general public. That's the general reason why I'm distanced in school, I won't detail further.Currently it's 6 am, I have one friend in steam and the blizzard app, i'll call him surprising.
surprising and i speak different languages, but we manage to chat with what we know about english.
i've barely heard his voice through voice chat in overwatch, other than that, we only know each other through letters on a screen.his pc isn't too good, and latin america isn't particularly wealthy, so pretty much all we've played is overwatch.i bought overwatch about a year ago, and also started the thing about trans. i was not ok with being identified as male, it was hard in real life but online appearances didn't matter... i thought it was a good idea to be myself online, hiding the way i was born, and a good chance to see if people thought i was weird or not.back to realitysurprising knows about my gender, and after a bit of explaining he seemed wholly fine with it.
but now he's very busy with his studies or so i was told, and overwatch has been getting pretty tiring after many months of playing the same game, there's distance now.it's starting to sink in.i'm finally beginning to understand that, no close friends can help me. if i want to get closer to distant friends i'll have to maintain a happy facade if i don't want to be left again. it's happened more times than i can count, in my school, in my family, on the internet... it's all proofnobody is interested in me, i'm too weird, i have too many issues, friends shouldn't fix them, and i can't alone.
if anyone gets to know me deeply they'll leave disgusted.
my days are just filled with silence. i don't talk to anybody, i don't have any friends online, i won't ever be close to anyone,
chats help but, there's not even that now.i dont think i want to suffer this silence anymore.
i promised to surprising i was gonna wait until new year to see if... anyone else entered my life by chance?
but i don't think i'm getting any better. there's no way anybody else will show up, let alone stick around
the silence is starting to erase my.. personality? i've been accepting things the way they are, i've always loved spending time with people, but i'm not trying to find more friends online anymore in fear that they would just hurt me... i'm zoning out more, my thoughts are emptier, my arms are more hurt and my diet's disappearing...
it's starting to ruin mewhat point is there in changing your appearance to suit your gender when, nobody will even interact with youi think i wanna see me crumble before showing myself to anybody elseand the side of me that is still foolishly hopeful that somebody will show up is starting to go away tooam i too far gone?... if that's the case, could you confirm it please? at least a word or two? anybody?..."
I don't understand what to do.,"I want to die.I'm so lonely I have no friends. I've spent my entire life in school being bullied, no friends, and as a adult I do nothing but work. On my off days I lay in bed waiting to go to work.I have no hobbies, I have nothing. What's the point of going on? Edit: bye."
I'm sick of living,"I have had a lot of admissions to hospital and im in a lot of debt. I gave up my job to go to university and now Im broke and worried. My psychiatrist keeps pushing my appointments back, my care coordinator tries to help but she can't get me therapy.The suffereijg got suddenly worse 2 years ago and its onky gottejnworse since. Ive tried 12 medications, several bad reactions, several overdoses.I cant take it anymore.I dont want to leave people like my mum and my best friend. But thags all i have and im always miserableIm thebworst amd it isnt gettin beyter"
My final night. Everything is in order.,"Well, it's my final night in existence. Everything has been taken care of. The note and my last wishes are all written out and the materials with which to do the deed are in order. All I have to do is go through with it. I'd rather not go into the details surrounding it though. I'm just going to keep getting the same old clich̩ responses. So I guess this is my final goodbye. This whole thing seems like a dream yet it feels so surreal. Time to take the plunge."
Diagnosed with glaucoma. As if the banshee shrieking tinnitus wasn�۪t enough.,"As for the tinnitus, nothing helps. I tried that reddit method but it doesn�۪t work. I am 5 more cries from a bath with a razor and some aspirin. What the fuck is left for me? God fucking fuck fucking fuck fuck fuck
I�۪m going to lose my eyes. All I�۪ve ever wanted was to go to medical school to become a surgeon, and all of that is ruined by something I have no control over. No one in my who fucking family has glaucoma. The doctors have no fucking idea how it happened. I�۪m an anomaly. Everything is ruined.
Post Script: I also have two ingrown hairs that have gotten infected and I don�۪t even shave down there in the first place. Also I�۪m a faggot with a creationist/neo conservative father that wants me to die.
There, off my chest."
Anyone else find life to much work and just not worth it,"I'm living for nothing. Don't care about money (only buy food), struggle to make friends, self esteem issues so no gf. Can't get myself to study when I'm living for nothing. Just be easier to end it all but no I can't even do that as it would abousulty destroy my mum. Just cba trying to fix my so many issues "
I'm not allowed to express how I feel.,"I sometimes manage to wrack up energy and will power to phone one of those suicide phone numbers for help, but the issue is in there guidelines it says they would have to have me locked up if I said how I was actually truthfully feeling. So I'm stuck in a situation where I can't even talk to the people who are best trained for my situation. I'm fucked."
Click here for some boring life story,"I'll be 22 next month. Dying young and fugly sounds right up my alley!I've been ridiculously depressed/suicidal since I was 9. I remember wishing I'd wake up as a boy, but I hid my thoughts and feelings from everybody. I mainly wanted to be male for life's opportunities. I wanted to join the army, be a mechanical engineer, a construction worker, an auto detailer, work in the oil industry, as a welder, almost every virtually unattainable job for someone like me. I don't want to fight for acceptance and prove myself, as well as probably deal with sexual harassment. I just wanted to be ""one of the guys"". But I can't. Ever.I've been deeply fascinated with the military since I was a kid, as well as cars and guns. My mom says I'm an old soul/been here before. Maybe my soul was thrown into this useless husk by accident? HahahaMy life currently revolves around my Challenger. I've felt rather masculine all my life, and I believe that's why I've never had a proper boyfriend. Maybe it's because I'm black and 5'10 too, who knows. I have mostly guy friends and simply cannot click with most women, tbh I don't really like them. I've tried becoming friends with lots of girls who like cars as much as I do (online groups/forums), and they just blow me off. Car guys respect me and I've made several lasting friendships with them.  Everyone I know describes me as happy, full of life and so nice/kind. If only they knew of my plans to buy that s&w revolver I'd been wanting for over a decade. I'm terrible at math. Even if I wanted to be one of those trailblazers in the STEM/trades fields, I'm literally incapable of doing so. I've tried filling in the gaps on my math skills, but it's just too much to catch up on. I've never set foot in college, because I know it would be a waste of money and time with my shitty skills. I've been working since high school graduation, being the breadwinner for my mom and grandma.My mom uses me as her shoulder to cry on and depend upon. I can't do that with her. She always gets mad and makes it all about herself. She guilt trips me about wanting to try alcohol (she doesn't know that I keep a stash of a variety of mini bottles in my room), but has no problem probing me for cash to buy her cartons of cigs (not cheap...)There's so much more, but I'm tired of trying to sneak type this at work. I'm just not happy. I hate my body and my mind. Just one bullet to the head will end everything. "
What is the point,"I'm 19 and for as long as I can remember I have struggled to find any motivation or ambition. I am widely regarded as an asshole despite my efforts in the last few years to be more apathetic but I've only lost friends since then. My girlfriend since I was a sophomore is growing increasingly distant from me and is having problems of her own in college so she said she doesn't have the time to help me with my problems and called my selfish when I mentioned my problems to her. I owe my two best friends over $600 collectively and have no job. Everyone told me that after I graduated from high school things would get better and I'm here months later even more unhappy and no prospects of success at all. I want to die and I don't know what to do. Nothing helps. Ive been sitting in my backyard for 2 hours contemplating and it all led me here somehow. If I don't do it today I'll just end up doing it some other time. What's the point. Why shouldn't I do it.  First it was ""you'll see after you graduate"" and now it's "" you just need to find a job"" I graduated and I had a job and was still miserable. Why should I even bother anymore. It seems to me that I would just be wasting my time"
I can�۪t get therapy.,"I�۪ve been depressed and suicidal for about five years now (I just turned 17), and I have a lot of issues caused by past traumatic events. I�۪m in a really tough place right now, and I really want to get out of it. My parents don�۪t give a fuck about me. My boyfriend doesn�۪t give a fuck about me. My only friends don�۪t give a fuck about me. Nobody here cares about me. I�۪m homeschooled, by the way, so I can�۪t just ���go to school and meet new people.�۝ I am NOT going back to public school. They�۪re the reason I�۪m the way I am now. I need help. I need to fix my problems, but I can�۪t do it on my own. I need professional help, like everyone�۪s been telling me I need for the last five years. I don�۪t know what to do. I don�۪t have insurance. If my parents see me crying or if I tell them or show any signs of me being upset they get really mad and yell at me cause ���I have no reason to be upset.�۝ They only think that because they don�۪t know a single thing about my life. They don�۪t know the reason why I wanted to be homeschooled so bad (I basically got raped by my ex, and he got away with it. The whole school bullied me and called me a liar.) My parents don�۪t even know my favorite color. My dad is always at work or asleep, and my mom is a fucking bitch. She is always out cheating on my dad with younger, married white men. I include white because she�۪s racist and will not even LOOK at anyone of another race. Not even her own. Even if she�۪s home, if I ever try to talk to her she gets extremely mad at me because ���she�۪s on Facebook.�۝ No matter what it is I have to say to her.
Not only do my parents not want to help me, even if they did, we have no money. We�۪re really close to losing our house right now, so I have to GIVE UP MY ROOM AND SLEEP WITH MY MOTHER so that we can rent out my room and still keep the house. That is the LAST thing I want to do. I wish I could be older and have money so I could move the fuck out.
I am trying to get a job, but I know that until I get help, this will never work out. I�۪ve already been rejected three times.I could go on and on and on and on about my problems, but that will get me nowhere. What I came here to do is ask for help. I can not afford therapy, and I�۪ve looked online for some sort of online therapy, and they�۪ve said I need face-to-face therapy and that online counseling will not work for my issues. I can�۪t afford therapy, and my parents will not do anything to try and take me.  I need help. Please. I�۪m suffering so much. My heart can�۪t take the pain much longer. I know it�۪s going to just stop one day. "
Going to kill myself soon,"Not gonna write much in this it's not worth it what are some few people on the internet gonna do to improve my life just wanted to share this... So I'm a  a very generic average boy with severe depression and with the worst parents ever in one of the worst country ever
My life has never delivered me what I wanted and worked for.. Everyone Ive met hates me I never had a gf only had like 3 best friends my best friend always treats my like shit and I can't do anything about it and my father was old stingy and simply not fit to be a father same goes for my mother my parents hate me tooI didn't bother telling anyone about this except for an online friend who couldn't do much but tell me to live which isn't such a great advice to someone who's ready to die Ive got it all planned no one will miss me some people will be happy.. I'm gonna drink 6 liters of water (yes that works alot of people died like this and that amount is enough to kill a fully grown adult and my body is small so this is overkill)  Ive already started preparing by drinking 2 liters a day but I'm just afraid of one thingWhat's after death.. Is it the same as before I was born.. Is it gonna be heaven and hell.. Or maybe I'll just be born as another miserable person or animal There's no point in living it's just an endless  loop of pointless survival everyday I wake up telling myself that maybe today is gonna be a good day but I'm always wrong everyday is the same... PainfulSo this is it I guess if things get a little better I might no kill myself but if it keeps going this way then I'm probably gonna be dead before the end of this month"
the worst I've felt,"only one person in my life cares about me and she cut me out of her life today. She said I've been manipulative of her for the past two years, and I have been. The entire relationship is so complicated and I feel like nobody can understand"
Lost the will,"Never good at typing shit up but I'm fed up with life, a woman who claims. To love me but I who knows, horribly abusive parents, and I just have lost all motivation to care I don't know what to do to get out of it, that urge to end my. Life is getting to be too much and therapy doesn't help. Medication doesn't help I know. I need a change but the quickest change as of right now is to end my life, I'm going to do it I don't want to stop my self anymore."
I can barely function anymore,"I can't keep myself going.  I lost my mom to cancer, so the only reason I feel like sticking around is because my death would destroy my father.  That and my dear old dog.  I'm afraid that once he's gone I'm gonna go past my breaking point.  I'm in so much pain, i feel like if there was an easy way to end it all i'd have taken it already. Let's start at the beginning.  I've been obese since the day I was born. As long as i can remember my stoner mother and neglegent father fattened me up.   I was a momma's boy, and since my mom was a 300 lb stoner, my young impressionable habits followed suit.  I was averse to healthy eating, averse to sports, and averse to social interaction. It wasn't even that i didn't want to be social.  I tried my best, but i was constantly mentally and harassed for my weight.  Groped, punched, had shit thrown at me, and abused in so many more ways i can''t describe, but my teachers and principal never cared about me until i lashed back, since i was so much bigger than these kids. This extended all throughout middle school and high school.   People hated me merely for .The memories echo through my head, day in, day out, every moment of my life.  When my mind is idle it will drift to all the abusive shit people have done to me. I have a constant desire to find these old classmates online and tell them that i hope they are hit by a car.  I got my dad stuck in a toxic relationship after i formed a close bond with my dad's slightly insane girlfriend who i latched onto after my mother died of cancer when i was 9. He's almost 60 now and I feel like he'll never find love again because of me.  He stayed in that relationship because of me, and since I am just like him, he can't get over the wrong that's been done to him.  This among my many other screw ups growing up, such as getting sucked into check fraud and getting kicked out of middle school for assaulting someone (long story, but i was in the wrong.) have made me feel like i've made his life miserable.  I have an older brother, but he's gay as well.  It kills me that i can't at least make him a grandparent.For a while there i was okay.  I had some good friends and a lot more confidence in myself because of it, but as we started drifting apart i picked up some self destructive behaviors and friends to follow. I started smoking weed religiously and still do to this day, my head hurts without it.  I took so much LSD my senior year my head has never quite felt the same.  I got into video games and daydreaming as an escape.  I'm always imagining my own world of wonder, the idea that I might write it into a book one day keeps me entertained with living any longer.  If i die, the stories die too.  I've had a couple ""best friends"" who turned out to be extremely toxic to me.  Most recently, i snapped at someone i once considered the best friend i'd ever have because he was so fucking stupid, pretentious and ignorant.  Things got worse when i discovered my sexuality.  I was sleeping around pretty young and contracted gonnohrea at 17, one week before Senior prom.  I had no clue what was going on and was deathly afraid of telling my dad, so i let it fester unknowingly for about a week.  I did finally get myself treated and seemed to be fine again.  Until my symptoms resurfaced several months later. I've done irreprable damage to my urethra, it takes me longer than normal to urinate. Ejaculating and urinating can be uncomfortable and even a little painful at times because the last bit of fluid never seems to fully evacuate, and i can feel it.  I've been to a urologist several times and they don't seem to know what to do with me.  My problem stems from stress and excessive sex and masturbation, the more i stress the harder it becomes for me.  This has become a HUGE problem for me.  I don't want to live like this, when every time I get stressed out it becomes difficult to pee or potentially worse as my prostate clamps down.  And I'm constantly stressed, the condition feeds off itself.  I'm stressed about how it will affect me as i get older, only making the condition worse. This all came to a head about 3 weeks ago.  My sweet dog, the only thing that makes me feel whole and happy and gets me through the day, got pepper sprayed by the mailman because i left the door open a moment too long.  This caused something in me to snap.  I want this man to suffer in so many unfathomable ways.  I'm so angry, he pepper sprayed my baby, my child, a 12 pound dog.  My dog is fine, but this happened the very day after i got back from a very stressful trip out of town in which i missed my him so much.Prior to this occurence, i was somewhat normal, though everything i mentioned about myself still apparent, and still suicidal.  After though, something snapped.  I can't stop thinking of all the ways I've been hurt.  I'm constantly angry and just don't feel like continuing.  I have trouble getting out of bed.My behavior is really starting to scare me. I've become a recluse, i don't want to leave my house, and this just makes everything worse.  I always catch saying weird shit out loud when I'm home alone and mumbling to myself in public, typically having something to do with a random thought i had.  I have constant thoughts of revenge and suicide.  Neither of which I truly want to act upon, but they're there, burning themselves into my mind. I am going to school but my grades are awful, so i'm basically mooching off my dad.  This isn't working for me, I'm 19 and need to find a job already, but i'm so adverse to social interaction and my condition keeps me afraid of a work space due to my bathroom problems.I don't want to kill myself, i just want to cease existing.  I didn't ask for this life, i didn't want any of this, but i was presented with it and constantly fuck things up making them worse.  Pushing away decent friends, getting myself into trouble.  I'm scaring myself.  I had no other clue what to do but post here.  I was prompted to seek help because I just couldn't stop crying and screaming right now, the echoes of all the abuse wouldn't stop.  I just want it to stop, i don't want to think about this shit every time my mind wanders.  I'm pretty sure everyone around me thinks I'm insane, and I'm pretty sure I'm going insane.  I'm afraid of myself.  I need to find help before i hurt myself or someone else, though typing this out has been somewhat therapuetic. Any and all thoughts and feedback are appreciated, i've always wanted to get myself evaluated but i know my father  wouldn't be willing to pay for a professional. He doesn't believe anything is wrong with me and i'm not what or how to tell him about how i really feel."
I Have Lost Everything,I just want to end my life today. I have lost the person I loved and who supported me. I have no money to pay rent or care for my dog. I am all alone and scared. I feel my only option is to take my own life. I don�۪t know what else to do. Please help me.
I want to be brave enough to jump,"I know not many people will see or reply to this, but thats ok.  I just need to vent my true feelings somewhere because I can't bring myself to be so selfish as to tell someone in my life about these things. If you are reading this, you're not reading it for me. You're reading it for you. Whether you're going through a tough time yourself and are looking for others feeling the same way, or if you're here to try to help others, you're reading this for you. Everyone is here for their own selfish reasons. I've come to realize that every action someone takes is done so for purely selfish reasons, even if there are benefits to others. Doing a favor or being nice to others? Done so that they view you as a better person. Donating to a good cause? Done so for a feeling of self worth. Everyone that has ever cared about you has done so because of the way it makes them feel about themselves. Every Friend. Every relationship. No one cares just to care. This realization/belief has destroyed me, because I always tried to live life unselfishly. I want so badly to live selflessly.This belief keeps me from getting better. The want to help myself or do things for myself is selfish. The want to continue to go to therapy or tell a friend what I'm going through is selfish. I've been depressed for so long, and it's just getting worse and worse. The worst part is, I have no excuse. I had an ok family. I made it through college and got a job. I'm a normal looking guy in his mid 20's. I've had relationships. I have an ok amount of money. But its not enough, because I'm selfish. I've always felt alone, even with others. I moved to California a few years ago and literally know no one outside of work. And the feeling of loneliness and the want for attention is so strong that I literally have to stop myself from bursting into a coworkers office or calling an old friend and telling them I want to die. I crave attention, but I don't want the attention by asking for it. I want something that's impossible to have; genuine care. So now I'm stuck, because I'm also a coward. Depression and selfishness keeps me down all the time, but cowardice keeps me from committing suicide. I come home from work and just think about how shitty life is. I fantasize about people reactions to my suicide. I know its wrong to want to attention by killing myself. Most of the things I've read on here are about how people don't want to hurt their friends or family. I'm the opposite. I imagine my friends, my coworkers, and my family feeling true emotional pain once they found out I'm gone, and it only fuels me to want to die more. I've been thinking about the Golden Gate bridge for months now. I've fed myself with all the documentaries and videos of jumpers. It really is the best option. It's accessible and almost foolproof. I've gone down to the bridge once already, but accidentally took a wrong turn at the exit and ended up back on the 101 heading home. My therapist suggested maybe it was fate that I took a wrong turn. Maybe so, but it was cowardice that kept me from coming back. Sometimes I imagine the jump, and I know in my mind that I'd regret as soon as I jumped. But living isn't really worth it.I just want to have the courage to fall. -M"
This is it. Time to die.,Can't do it anymore. Trazodone ready. Tonight is the night.Edit: fuck I can't even show enough balls to kill myself. I really am a loser who screws everything up.
"I can't be fixed, I just fucking can't, and it's because of men...","I'll say it now, before you thinking I'm a woman, I'm not, I'm a straight male and I despise other men. Why?Men ruined my fucking life, that's why. I hate every last fucking one of them, know what men are? They're animals, fucking animals, violent, selfish, aggressive animals. Men are about one stone throw away from chimps. They created a fucked up society where literally sociopath is rewarded above all else and kindness and altruism is weakness.Men have bullied me my entire life. Why? Because I don't fit in with what they're supposed to be. Because I'm not aggressive. Because I have a gentle nature. Because I'm passive.Women may not like me, that's true, but men made sure they don't, by making it impossible for me to like myself. Being insulted as a kid, being told my whole life either that I'm not good enough or I'm a freak has thoroughly broken me beyond repair. No matter what I do it never gets better, because someone sees my vulnerabilities and stabs at it. Because that's what men fucking do, tear each other to pieces at any opportunity, like rats. Now all I see myself as is a subhuman freak that should have his throat slit, while the pigs that ruined me enjoy lives filled with friends and women. I truly, utterly hate men, with all my heart, they're animals, and, because I was passive they ruined me.Now I'm an animal too.I wish I could eliminate all men save for the ones in my family and my few friends. Because, far as I can see, every one of them is as evil at their core as the last."
Friend needs help and is worrying me,"My friend (Whom i've never yet met) has been texting me the last day and seems to be pretty serious about ending it. Her self esteem is non-existant at this point, and for months I've done my best to not mention the word ""help"", but today I did and only made it worse. She keeps saying ""It's fine"" but I know it's not, she needs help but refuses any at all costs. I've tried so many things and i'm just in a complete panic right now, I didn't know where else to go, and I don't know what i'm doing with this post, asking for any advice at all I guess. Please she needs help. "
She wants to be friends but...,"I don't have any friends anymore, at the age of 25. I have my bf and that's it. My mother tries to get close and is confused why we aren't closer and why I won't open up.I tried calling her today after a fight with my bf and she just laughs...I seriously just wish I were gone...I so badly want someone close I can talk to but idk how to anymore. I can't function as a normal adult and I can never tell if I'm overreacting or if my feelings of neglect are true. I just want it all to end."
Soon.,I have no idea when or how it will happen. I only know it will.I hope it's soon.
Final ending it tonight,I have never posted here or even on reddit before but I�۪m on a bus right now into town to jump off a bridge. It�۪s been a long time coming but right now Iv never felt better knowing I final made a decision about ending my life. I�۪m sorry if this isn�۪t the right place to post this I just have no one else to tell this too. As soon as I get off the bus I won�۪t have an internet connection so I want to say thank you to everyone on this subreddit Iv read a lot of your stories and I truly hope you find peace with yourself. Thank you
Everything is blue,"I feel like nothing in the world can make me happy, nothing at all, not even the smallest pleasures like eating my favorite food...
If I can�۪t find happiness even in the smallest of things why should I keep trying, why should I keep existing?!"
"Gambling addict, life is over","I'm a horrible gambling addict. I can't stop. My mother has it, and her father had it too. I never win, I always lose, and I can't ever stop. I try to do everything I can to keep myself from doing it, but somehow I find a way. I cut up all of my credit cards, and it becomes a lot harder to do shit normally. I have to stop at the bank and walk in every time I need to get $20 to buy gas, of course they always ask me why don't I just use the ATM and I just want to die. Fuck.I have $21,000 in credit card debt and probably make $2,000 after taxes in one month. I'm also a full time college student with student loans piling up, probably going to be over $25,000 when I'm finished, if I even make it. I have a 4.0 but I'm so far behind on my work right now cause I can't stop panicking about my financial future. also, my study is in the finance world, who the fuck is going to hire somebody who can't even manage their own finances. i don't have anybody i can talk to. I don't want to go to GA because it's a fucking cult and basically forces you to adopt religion. I'm not interested in that. I don't want to do anything except kill myself. No one will miss me. There's no cure for me. I will never have nice things, a nice life, or a nice relationship "
"i�۪m going to kill myself tonight. i�۪ve finally made up my mind and i am so close to peace, only a few hours and i will be free. not sure why i am telling you all, or if anyone will even see this.","I don't know how much will this mean to you. But however you feel, you are not alone. Your life is as precious as mine as anyones.. don't take that gift for granted. Stand up when you fall because everyone falls.. there is someone waiting for you no matter what you feel right now. If it means anything to you, I know you have feelings, don't do it for this random stranger. Choose life."
So tired,"I'm done. I'm exhausted, sick, depressed, and nearly blind. At 18 I found out I have a disease called uveitis among a slough of other eye issues rendering me legally blind, and for the most part unable to see much but blurs on the average day. I started drinking like an idiot to forget this resulting in an ulcer causing me to be horribly sick for nearly a year, in that time I developed anxiety because every night the pain would come and sleep, as a result would not. The ulcer healed after I stopped drinking and took medication for a while, but my fear of sleeping led me to insomnia. I haven't slept more than an hour a night in three years.
    Sometimes I hallucinate shadows in the corners of my eyes, the only things I can see for the most part. I feel like I'm in a walking dream that won't end. I'm so tired, but sleep won't come. I get nauseous every night knowing I'll just lay there waiting for the sun to come back up. My life has turned into one endless rolling day.
    I can't get a job, because no one will hire me because I can't see well enough to perform basic duties. I can't even get a job as a fucking dishwasher. My medication for my eyes barely works and makes me very sick. I have hardly any friends, but that's beside the point, I think I pushed the few I had away with my pessimism, and I don't blame them.
    I spend most of my day in my room, thinking of the most effective form of suicide, but I have no access to a gun and the other methods seem too messy, I don't want anyone to have to clean my brains off the sidewalk. I just want to be normal. And I know I'm not alone or special, I'm not seeking attention, I guess this is more like a diary that anyone can look at, though I don't know why anyone would.
    I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I know most of these issues are self inflicted and I don't want or expect sympathy. I just want the easiest way out of this living hell."
Damn i don�۪t know what to think right now,"everything for me lately has been so ... slow for a lack of better words. It all started in the summer when i lost my best friend i�۪ve ever had in my life. Lost him because my parents were made we were hanging around and smoking weed. His parents banned me from seeing him and we haven�۪t hung out since. Ever since that happened i�۪ve come to the realization he was my only friend. i literally have no friends. i walk through the halls at school with my head down and my earbuds in. it�۪s not that i�۪m an outcast type of guy. when i�۪m our with people i�۪m usually the goofy kid. always have been. i�۪ve never really considered myself depressed until the past couple months. and then about a month ago i met this really really awesome girl and we hit it off, went on a couple dates and became a couple about two weeks ago. things were starting to feel normal again. she made me real happy and i (thought) i made her happy as well. she is so beautiful. well tonight over text she tells me she�۪s not ready for a relationship. out of the blues i noticed she was acting kind of weird today so i texted her about it asking if everything was okay. well i got back from some college night at my local community college and there�۪s her text. ���not ready�۝ ���maybe some time down the road�۝ ���i have too much going on�۝ the usual bullshit. she couldn�۪t even tell me it in person. i�۪m so sad. i don�۪t think i�۪m going to kill myself but i�۪m thinking about it tonight more than usual. i know if things keep going at this rate i will spiral out of control. i can guarantee that. this seems like typical hs bullshit and i guess it is but normal high schoolers wouldn�۪t be so upset over a two week relationship like this. whenever i thought of her or was with her it was like an escape from my fucked up mind. a fucked up mind that keeps getting more fucked up by the day."
I wish i had a gun so i could do it the easy way,"I wish so much i could be able to obtain a gun. It bugs me that fucking cattle can die in a less painful way than me (and i don't mean to be an apologist of the meat industry). I can hang myself with a rope, choking and pissing myself while i risk failing and resulting in brain damage, i can cut my throat while i feel my arteries clogging from the blood going to my head, and i can even throw myself from a tall building and dying at the shock of everyone surrounding me. But i can't die in a simple and human way like a bullet to the the head. Why is this? Why can't the state guarantee to give me the right to die in a easy way? I don't mean rights to possess guns for self-defense, especially in the light of the events ocurred in Las Vegas, but why can't they set up a clinic where you get locked up in a bulletproof room with a gun until they're sure you're dead? It is so infuriating. Maybe i'll become an US citizen and buy a cheap pistol like a Kel-Tec, but i wish i had this right in my native country."
Expectations not met.,"Am i suicidal? Maybe? Maybe not.. I don�۪t know, yet.. I�۪m a failure. That�۪s what i think.. and know.. They�۪re expecting too much, I�۪m trying my best but still not enough.. I love them but they always say i�۪m giving them headaches.. heartaches. What would you do when those people you love thinks you�۪re a burden. I don�۪t know what to do. I really don�۪t know. Now i�۪m here standing at the back of a gasoline station, cigarette lit up, eyes sweating.."
My state of mind,"Hey im a 19 year old dude from Australia . This whole year has been weird. Ive had moments wanting to take my own life. But never  did. I did try once. But i stopped beforehand (sleeping pills).
Im in this state where i dont feel anything. I guess you could say, numb?
It began eversince i split  from my former partner. The heartbreak made me force myself to be isolated from anyone for a long time. i eventually got out of shell to try and become more social. But i got so used to that feeling of self loathment i kind of accepted it, and i dont like that. I now am very nihilistic and pessimistic and the only thing that keeps me going is to make other people happy. I guess you could say i enjoy seeing people smile. Makes me happy for a while. People say to try be happy, but i know when i try its fake and it never works. I wouldnt say im still  in full heartbreak. Just in this hole where  i cant seem to get out off. I used to be so happy and motivated last year, however this year has just been nithing. . I feel nothing, as if i have nothing to lose and that scares me. I honestly  feel empty and it physically hurts."
Can�۪t stand the loneliness anymore.,"I feel like a weird loser everytime I step into school. I have this feeling where I don�۪t want to get better and I personally agree with it. I�۪m 18 atm and I can�۪t stand life anymore, I feel like ending myself soon."
Why stick around when I don't want to anymore? Vent/rant,"I'm a 23 year old complete failure, I have no desire to do anything anymore. I'm just a burden to people.
All I ever hear is ""are you okay?"", ""I'm worried about you.""  I barely eat anymore, when I do it makes me feel disgusted, I can't sleep without the aid of some kind of medicine. I feel completely numb 24/7 365, working in retail ive learned how to ""act"" happy or not to look miserable. When people ask me what my goals are, I have none, no hobbies, nothing. I work and sleep..
 I recently I've tried going out more with friends or whatever, I feel alone even when with them. People say ""think about how people would feel if you killed yourself"" there's billions of people on this planet, there's plenty of others you could replace me with. Another one is ""things will get better eventually"" I'm done trying, im done waiting.
 I have 2 relatives that are around who care about me, that's it. My mother's dead, i had to watch her suffer through brain cancer.  Father never came into my life, left before I was born.
Why should I should i stay around and stagnate? This life is hell, I can't take much more.

nothing to live for again,"I have so much shit right now I don't even know if I can write it all outand if I do it'll probably be all out of order but whateverso there's this girl ive been crushing on pretty hard pretty much since I met her at the beginning last school year but especially these past few weekslike for real i can't look at her without my heart racingbut anyway after over a year I had finally started to come to the delusion that she could almost like me backabsurd, but I have been working hard to improve myself, I've lost weight, I'm in better shape, more outgoing and I seem like less of an asshole I thinkit's kind of difficult because not only do we share classes but we're also both on the shotgun team and her dad is the coach and her mom the finance director or some shit so she shows up to every practiceher, my best friend and l are the oldest ones on the team with everyone else being freshmen or youngerso her mom and the coach often talk to me because freshmenI'm super quiet around them but I try my
damnedest to come off as a nice person without seeming fake by being a completely different person suddenlyl'm quiet in general so it's not out of character but I think they both like me so i thought that helped my chancesneither her nor any of the girls in my class
message me at all unless the teacher asked them to tell me about a change in assignment or somethingI don't want to initiate anything to be weird but I've considered ways to do soanyway my aforementioned best friend is super active on Snapchat and has her added
so he took a picture of me which normally isn't funny but based on my personality around everyone it's funny in how
out of character it is and then he sent another normal picture of me I didn't know he took and basically said jokingly ""look at this hunk of man he's
single and ready to mingle""now I'm sure my crush is pretty obvious to him so I assume that's why he sent itand she responded ""you crazy"" which was kind of out of character because she can be pretty quiet too so I thought that could be a deflection, rightI thought that was a good signbut apparently she asked a sophomore (we're juniors) to prom (which is in like March) even though as far as I know she has never even met himand like I said she can be pretty quiet so this was p surprising toodon't get me wrong, I'm not saying she asked him to try and make it seem like she doesn't like me because they have a ton in common and if I had to pick someone she would want to go with it would be him, but I don't understand how she would know thatshe was basically the light at the end of the tunnel for meso regardless of why it happened it did and now I don't have anything to live for and it's taking everything in me to not just end it
my life almost seemed to be turning around because i was becoming less of a piece of shit and getting somewhere but that doesn't mean anything if I don't have anyone to be a better person for"
Living Suicidal,"I post this here as I know a lot of you would have felt or would be feeling the same. I am suicidal a lot of the time, but not ""act on it"" suicidal. I think about it, I google it, I make half arsed plans I know I won't carry through. I realise there are levels of suicidal. I have attempted suicide. I have been ""paralysed by pain of having to live and screaming in agony"" suicidal. I have been ""why doesn't everyone around me want to die too"" suicidal. But with help I am slowly improving.First of all, I'd like to say to anyone reading this, if you are dealing with any level of suicidal thoughts, they are all hard. They all suck, and just because your not actively trying to take your life, or your not bed-ridden, or it seems like it's worse for others, it doesn't make your struggles less important. You are deserving of help and support. Your problems are real. Accept all the help you can get.I'm currently ""I can stay alive because I know there are people who would be devastated if I died"" suicidal. This means that life must go on, and I have to keep moving. My question to anyone who can answer me is, how do I do this? Im a medical student, so I need to study, but so often I go back to the thought ""I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive, how am I meant to do anything with that life?"" I understand this is a vague question, I just really hope someone understands what I mean.Thank you and I hope your all doing ok"
I just keep thinking about it...,"I don't have any friends and my family is pretty far away. I'm in University but I find it hard to go to lectures with IBS, it makes me feel like shit- which is fitting because its probably how I smell. I'm failing at the one reason my parents are PAYING for me to do here. I have tried to go to places that could help in the uni but they keep referring me to one another like a really competitive tennis match...and I keep thinking about killing myself. I sound pathetic admitting it but it swirls around my head incessantly."
"I think within a year or so, I'll just go ahead and be done with all of this.","Hi. I'm 19. I'm a girl. I'm pretty much over my life. My job sucks, my dad died when I was eight, I disappoint my mother on a daily basis, I have no friends, and I am so tired of all this. I am so tired of just looking around and seeing flourishing lives that I try so hard to be apart of, but I'm just not the right person for people. Everyone always has someone so much better to go to. I don't know what's wrong with me.  I wish I could just be normal like everyone and be happy again. I can't even remember the last time someone hugged me or told me to have a good day or whatever. I try so hard to be a good friend to everyone but they always leave me.And I constantly am not enough for my mom. I made A's and B's in high school but she wanted me to graduate with honors and ribbons. She wanted me on the dean's list in college like my dad was, and then I got into my freshman year of college and failed one class out of the three I could take, which completely fucked me over. Now I don't know how I'm gonna pay for college, and I can't imagine how fucking disappointed she is with me. I can't live with knowing that the only person who I love and want to make happy anymore thinks I'm a fucking failure of a child. I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to buy her a giant house and get her that convertible she's always wanted, but I'm never going to do that as long as I keep showing her that I'm probably her biggest regret.I just can't. It sounds really pathetic but I don't see my life getting any better. I've been feeling like this since I was 13 and as cheesy and pathetic as it sounds, it's only getting worse. And honestly, I feel like I'm just taking up space. My mom has three other kids who still have potential to make her smile. I've failed at that as well as just making friends. My only best friend told me to ""get over it"" when I talked about this emotional stuff (I wish I was joking about that, but I'm sadly not) and so I just keep it to myself now.I don't know what I keep doing wrong in every aspect of my life, but I'm quite tired of it. And I just don't wanna keep breathing for the sake of nothing. I'm just taking up space from other people. And I don't want to do this anymore. I clearly can't function correctly like everyone else. And I just don't wanna feel so alone anymore. So when the time comes this year, I'll probably just leave. I don't know how, but I will. And that'll be less pressure off of everyone's shoulders. I'm sorry. It's not like it's your guys fault or you can do anything, but I'm just sorry. To everyone. "
Suicidal,I want to kill myself
"Can't stop shaking, feeling nauseated",The physical symptoms of my anxiety are going to kill me. I can't do this anymore
The only thing keeping me from killing myself is money,"I want to kill myself in a hotel. With a note on the door telling them not to enter, just call the police. I don't want my family to find my body. And I don't want a public suicide like getting hit by a train, which I considered. I don't want to make anyone's life harder. I just want to leave it to the professionals. But I can't afford a hotel. Or a motel. Or even a bus across town to get to one. "
"Not sure what to say, but I really think my life isn�۪t worth living at all","So I�۪ve always been wrestling with depression, but lately I�۪ve come to terms with the fact that I�۪d probably never win. My life is shit and I can�۪t fix it, it�۪s out of my hand. I really want to end it all now. Losing is something I can�۪t accept but I feel like a loser, I just can�۪t come to terms with the fact that no matter how hard I try I�۪ll always be a loser. "
The Vegas Mass Shooting,"It makes me so upset that none of those people probably wanted to die, but here I am, miserable in life yet still living. I would take all of their places so that they could live. "
I'm unattractive and lonely,Looks DO matter to a point and yeah i dont have that. I'm at home right now trying to figure out how i can kill myself
I'll be gone by week's end.,"My grandmother was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure, spent several days in the hospital and isn't expected to live much longer. I live with her and I don't have the money to afford an apartment let alone continue paying my already current bills. I'll be homeless without anywhere to go. I can't deal with everything collapsing around me. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. I hope that others may find peace in their lives."
I have a gun,I hope this doesn�۪t break the rules I guess. I�۪m just thinking through a lot right now and I just need someone to talk to that isn�۪t an angsty teenage asshat (like myself)
messed up one last time,"Not sure why i'm typing this..probably because I won't be telling anyone in my family about how I feel. And i've been numb since it happened.  I was supposed to go to bct in less than a month, but I totaled my vehicle and got a dui.. can scratch that good bye. I'll never get a chance like this again. my life long dream ruined, no future plans and don't want any. Can't believe i've fell this low, should have died when I wrecked."
Depression,"I�۪m suffering with depression,I�۪m on citalopram n attending a CBT course, i have a g/f n a 3y/o son,a mortagage,a job but I want to die. I�۪ve had enough of living and just want to kill myself. Nothing anybody says or does will stop me from doing it, I just need to find a painless easy way to do it. Any suggestions?"
You want to know how weak I am?,"Somehow I ended up on this post from Cracked called ""6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You A Better Person."" The overall message of the article was ""get gud,"" but I don't think I've ever been motivated to kill myself. I wish I had a gun in the house so I could just get this over with. I'd stab myself with a knife, but a death like that would require so much willpower that I know I wouldn't be able to finish the job. With a gun, you just pull the trigger and it's over. The whole article just confirmed what I already knew; I'm worthless and offer nothing to anyone. Hell, I don't even think of myself as a decent human being, so when they wrote about how ""seeing yourself as a good person isn't enough,"" that just even more thoroughly convinced me that I was right. Oh well. Like I said, I don't have a way to kill myself that I know I could pull off, so it's not like any of this matters. I'll go to bed tonight and wake up in the morning and I'll be back to my same old killing time and wasting space. I wish I had never read that."
Considering taking my life if my SSI (disability) appeal gets rejected,"My initial application was denied. So I�۪m appealing. But if the appeal doesn�۪t work...my life will probably go to hell. Suicide seems a reasonable option. I just want thoughts/feedback on this.Also: Would including in my appeal a statement like ���if I don�۪t get SSI, I�۪m probably going to kill myself�۝ help my case or hurt my case? (Would they roll their eyes and ignore it? Consider it manipulative? Deny my appeal and then send me to the psych ward? Or see it as a sign that they were wrong to deny my original application?)I hope this is the right place to post this. If not, let me know."
Dad's friends raped me.,"I feel paralyzed. I barely had enough energy to open up the computer. I don�۪t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. I�۪d been in the shower for almost an hour and I just can�۪t get it out. It�۪s crippling me and I�۪m helpless. I have no one else to tell this and I just want to kill myself. I just want the pain to end.I feel so much hate and anger but I can�۪t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. I hate you so much for letting them do this to me. I hate you so much for doing absolutely  while they raped me. Is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? None of this would�۪ve happened if mom was still here. She would�۪ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That�۪s how much I love you. Do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you�۪d do for me? You only had to show a little of it dad. You only had to stay sober. You only had to remember that I�۪m always here for you. But no, you chose the bottle over me. And I didn�۪t mind cleaning up after you. I didn�۪t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell. It�۪s the demons you brought in with you. You let them take control of you. You let them hurt me. But I still love you dad. I always will. Maybe when I�۪m gone I could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.I needed to tell all of this to you dad. I needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but I don�۪t have the courage and you don�۪t have your mind. I hope it�۪s not you who finds me. Sweet dreams dad. Remember me and please forgive me."
"I have no hope for the future, forever alone","I will try keep it short. I am 32 years old, haven't had a girlfriend in 13 years. Did some messed up things while I was drunk in high school. I touched 2 girls while they were asleep. I didn't rape them. I can't remember everything. I was lying in the bed with one, I can't remember exactly how it got there. I stopped when I realized she didn't want me touching her. I have said sorry to her, the other I can't get hold of. I feel very guilty and ashamed, and I should. I am disgusting. I never want to hurt anyone, ever. That was more than 16 years ago but I can't forgive myself. I lost my virginity to a prostitute at 26, and have been to about 22 after that. I am really a useless human being. I am unlovable and unforgivable. I don't know what the point is of going on. How can I ever find someone who could love me. Anyway, don't know if anyone will even read this. I am so depressed and have been from since I can remember. I am so alone. p.s I have fallen in love with a married woman, she is my only friend. I don't want to ruin her life and marriage. But I can't be without her. I should just book out."
"I will never get better, so what's the point?","I feel hopeless. I want to leave work now and just off myself. I have a plan in place I feel like life is never going to get better. This bipolar disease will never go away, and I will have recurring depression for the rest of my life. I will always be miserable and there is nothing I can do about it. That's just how it is.Mania is false happiness. I haven't been happy since I was a 10 year old kid (and I'm 26 now.) All of my friends left me when I was 10 and I've never been able to make friends after that after many, many attempts at making them. And my parents and brother don't give a shit because they don't have bipolar, let alone depression. So I have no one in my life to support me. Well, I do have a therapist, but what does she care... She just gets paid lots of $$$ to talk to me for half an hour.No one gives a shit about me because there IS no one in my life who CAN give a shit about me. That's the thing. In fact, if I off myself  like I want to, no one would even know. Or if they did know, they would be like ""oh well. this person was a waste of space anyway. Natural selection; cleaning up the gene pool.""My mood stabilizer certainly doesn't stabilize my mood. My antidepressant certainly doesn't do anything for depression. My antipsychotic certainly doesn't do anything for my mania. And fuck, Ritalin doesn't do anything either, nor does my Klonopin. Let's face it: I am treatment resistant"
Am I selfish for wanting to live?,"So I have a pretty good life tbf, but i'm a massive dickhead, i mean reeeeaaaaal dick to those who are close to me and i don't fully appreciate how kind people are to me. I always think that it'd be a whole lot better for everyone if i didn't exist, sapping all their love and giving nothing back. Or for future friends, lovers, children ect. who will have to deal with me. I have been thinking that i could just get rid of myself and make it alot easier for possibly dozens of people. But i don't want to die. I love life, there's so much that i love doing. But this just makes me feel even more selfish because i'm only staying here because i have such a good time personally. I don't know what responses i want, if any. I just needed to let someone know this because i'm usually quite a happy person and i doubt anyone would ever think that i'd ever even considered suicide. Thankyou for reading anyway.Edit: Just ignore this, i don't really think i plan on killing myself and there are people on here who reeeaaally do need help, i just wanted a bit if an outlet, i'm sorry."
Apparently I'm weird and obsessive now,"My ''friend'' said that the lengths I'm going to in order to win my ex back has become weird and borderline obsessive. I'm not going to apologise for being in love with her still. I swear that the moment I start to wonder if I can feel any lower, I start feeling lower.  I can't do right for doing wrong. I'm fucking hurting so much and I just don't know what to do. "
Advil,"What would happen if I took 21,600mg of Advil? Would it do anything to me? I'm done."
Reddit causing suicidal thoughts [HELP!],"I want to start this by stating that I've been diagnosed with OCD by psychologists but have always refused to take meds. This
tendency towards compulsive thought and regret seems to stem from the many tumultuous and dark times I have been through in my short and inconsequential life. Two days ago, I indulged in self-harm for the first time. I have a girlfriend and she loves me dearly. I know she would be devastated if I were to end my life but these thoughts seem to obscure any enjoyment for life that I used to have. I don't know how long I'll last.I, for the first time in my life, am considering suicide over a reddit post. There's an old reddit post that contains my personal info and shows up when my name is written into Google. I am an extremely anxious person with a proclivity towards obsessive and compulsive thought. The post in question is immature in nature and there's something about my name showing on the internet on such a post that makes my heart sink, thinking I will never get a decent job and everyone will take me for a fool. And if you're wondering under what form my name appears, it appears in a screenshot.I've tried reaching out to admins, twice and they seem to turn a blind eye to the fact that I'm thinking of ending my life over this. They give me the runaround ""Your full name does not constitute personal information."" which I would say it does. I mean what is there that's more personal than your full legal name? Also, where do you draw the line? A human being is telling you he's suffering and thinking of pulling the plug on his life, yet some old, insignifcant post (except for me, because finding it is a matter of typing my name) that's gathering dust somewhere on the backpages of reddit?I've tried reaching out to the guy who made the post, he agreed to help me and deleted his account shortly thereafter before I was able to provide him with the link that's been plaguing my mind for the past 2 months (I'm assuming he thought deleting his account would translate into all his old posts being deleted). I've tried everything that came to mind, left no stone unturned and have not succeeded in finding a good Samaritan that would help alleviate my pain. My life is in a dark place to begin with and this is starting to feel like the straw that will break the camel's back. Can anyone help me or advise me on what to do? Anyone know an admin that will take pity on me? "
Think I'm ready.,"Today started off so great. I actually slept in, and had a nice afternoon to myself. However, late afternoon turned to shit. My emotionally abusive mother replayed the days events as she saw them and began to tell me how I never take her time into consideration, I'm demanding, and unappreciative of everything she does for me. Which honestly I don't; I literally walk on egg shells just to not get chewed out and made to feel bad about myself even more.  After a yelling match in the car, I finally got some reprieve alone in my car. I decided to come paint because that's been my therapy as of late. However it's not really helping. I really want to initiate my ""plan"". I'm tired of not being able to do anything right it seems. I'm tired of my stunted maturity. I'm tired of this two steps one back bullshit. I'm tired being alone and having no friends to enjoy life with. I enjoy my solo excursions but they're aren't enough. I'm tired of made to feel like shit when someone has a bad day. I'm trying and I'm done trying. I think I'm just going to enjoy painting this piece and then I think I'm ready to follow through. ���_ُ_"
I can't wake up,"I feel like the only way to wake up and accept my reality is if I die- because none of this feels real, whatsoever , I feel trapped and scared and completely alone, and nothing is how it used to be , idk where I am anymore but it's not my reality "
"just fucking sad and angry all the time, nothing helps","theres nothing i can do... been trying for years, and cant get out of rock bottom. im just through with it all. i dont look forward to anything... if it was ""the plan"" to go through this much pain, i dont even want to move one step forward in life. i want to just stop living. ive wanted to for so long..."
Update: Cops thought I was dead,"See history for last post. Some things have happened since the last post. Kinda made a friend/acquaintance. Not evicted yet. Still in no shape to be doing regular people stuff. Posting cause I want to be heard, not looking for advice. I'm fucked, nobody else's  plan or words is going to change that. I know I'll slump into homelessness soon. Perhaps, even better, I'll get a ruling against me on the eviction and be basically unable to rent for 7 years. This issue, pressing as it may be, does not alarm me and push me into survival mode. The opposite in fact.  My safety net, emergency ermegency funds are gone. Some old debts have even gone into  collection. I have issues. A while ago I was almost on track to apply for disability benefits with the help of a therapist. What else is a bunch of psych visits and a bipolar/PTSD diagnosis good for? Still, that life is shit.Then my dad offed himself and I was left with enough money to fuck me up, but too much to admit I needed help. I knew it would, it has. It's mostly gone. I spent the money purely on limiting my interaction with people and other stressors as I then saw them. It is possible to cling to life in most wretched circumstances. I guess losing what I have will force me to 'live' more than I have been willing to. Thus the 'friend'. We met whilst sleeping rough on the street. In a few months it'll be a year since my last attempt. I'm getting out and walking and preparing hiking supplies. The uncertainty of the wilderness is alluring. As is the minimally social aspect. "
Everything Fell apart and I still have to keep going at 140% effort,"Background: I'm a college student pre med, my grades are good, I'm working on being published, I am a tutor and a TA, I seem to have friends. The whole package. It's actually just a sham, I hate every second I'm awake and I honestly can't think of a reason I haven't ended it already.I have always been an introvert and careful with people but I fell hard for someone freshman year, relationship ended this past summer badly for me. She picked up literally instantly and moved on after 3 years she was with someone else by 3 days out, I on the other hand feel totally isolated now; I have no one I trust with my real secrets and issues and basically anything that isn't shallow surface level things that aren't a buzz kill. Pretty heavy alcohol use, pretty heave script abuse. I have 0 time for anything in my life because I am working or studying or researching every waking minute of my life. I know I'm clinically depressed but I won't take the meds because I'd rather be dead than fat and they make you gain weight. This is the most alone most burnt out most stressed most broken I have ever been and I spend a chunk of my time staring at the balcony railing hoping I grow the balls to jump. I just. Don't know anymore. "
Fuck this is so stupid,"I feel so ugly all the time I could list out why I'm objectively ugly but who caresI don't want people to tell me im pretty because I really don't care what other people like physically about me, it's actually nice how little I care about something for once in my lifeI am not happy with my appearance to the point where A friend taking a snapchat of me or a picture ruins my day and sometimes I'll have to go to the bathroom and cryIt's not just my appearance, my voice and mannerisms are so ugly they make me almost more upset and those I can't even change with surgeryI am VERY hairy for a girl and I don't have the money to wax my entire body, and my female friends talk about how hairy they are when my stomach is much hairier than their legs and i can only joke but it hurtsDoesn't help my best friend is the most beautiful person I've ever seen with literally no flaws, gets compliments every where and people just breifly look at me and then look away, WHICH ID BE OK EITH IF I WAS CONTENT AND SURE OF MY APPEARANCE BUT I KNOW IM UGLY SO IT HURTSI am so sick of this I don't even need to be a model lookin person or have long eyelashes or arched eyebrows or thick hair or a small nose or anything I just want to be happy with my looks and I CANT be happy with the way I look now but I can't change it without surgery and I don't want to look plasticI just want to look nice so I can believe the concept of somebody soemwhere liking me romanticallySo I can take a picture at an event with friends and not cry afterwardsSo I can be confidentSo I can not always be upsetSo I can stop googling How to be pretty and How to have an objectively attractive face I am so TIREDI wish I wasn't so effected by something so
dumbI just want to be prettyidk what the point of this is I'm so so sorry ........"
Everything hurts,"I have fibromyalgia and everything hurts all the time. Next weekend everyone close to me is going to be away, and I. Don't want to be in this much pain all the time. I don't want this anymore."
IDK if it's right to keep living,"I lied to myself that my dream hadn't been come true,so i did't die yet.
But everything would still be fine, if i was dead now.
Selfish retarded poor R.O.C chinese they would be so happier.I don't even feel any regret if I'm dead.
Just fine.
Living is just like wasting time wasting energy.
No one loves me.
No one cares about me."
So sorry,"I just want my family to know when they look through my phone, I am so sorry. I didn�۪t want to get to this point, but I didn�۪t want to drag you back into my problems so soon after everyone thought I was doing great.To combat this episode I started SH again and used real deal razors. Made vertical with horizontal cuts overlapping. That pain wasn�۪t pain to me. It was bliss. I felt invincible, untouchable. But it was so short lived. So it became an addiction.To Cody,You were my best friend. You understood logical things like math and science, but not the depressed human mind. I felt like when I talked to you about it. You wanted to help, but didn�۪t understand how. I am sorry.To my Parents,God. I don�۪t even know where to start. I want to just end my emotional torment. I didn�۪t want to hurt you emotionally, but by committing suicide, I did. I will see you in Heaven.To my Siblings,Look, we didn�۪t get along well, but I knew you looked up to me. Sorry. I.. I wish it didn�۪t have to be this way.To my School, Teachers, and other Friends,I am sorry that I put you through this, all I ask of you is to move the hell on.Other family,I loved you all, and forever will in Heaven, I am so sorry that I put you through this, I guess we will meet again someday.To reddit,I am sorry that you read this. I am sorry you will mourn the loss of a kid who you never even heard of until he died."
Anyone else feel like they have no control over their life?,Like you're just a puppet?
I just realized how good I have it,"No one is dependent on me, so I could die without truly fucking up anyone's life. I have friends and family, but no kids or anyone else who'd genuinely be fucked if I died. And I'm still a college kid so society doesn't shame me for this.That's a pretty good deal. I see so many posts about people not wanting to go because of their kids or something."
"Why do people pull the ""Think about others"" shit any time they can?","I'm only alive for other people.I know I may sound like a dick when I say this, but saying that over and over doesn't change anything."
Good night,I procrastinated doing it yet another day. Maybe tomorrow...
my diary log as of so far.,"okay, my first time writing this, I know I will sound like some emo, whiny attention whore bitch, but I need to talk about this personally
since nobody really cares, or can really help, or really gives to fucks, or stereotypes me.First off, I wish I could stop looking down on myself, I can't do it because I'm always left behind, I can't stand to see others treat me different.
I'm treated as if I'm not like everyone else, and it's been like that since I was young, and it reminds me of those times, making me feel empty and unwanted.
I've tried so hard to grow up with at least a good image on myself, yet, I still can not grow to find my own meaning.
I try to make others laugh, it's my root of my own happiness, I try so hard to bring you and others joy, yet the flame slowly dies, and I can feel it, but I hold on because I feel something
...special, something wanted.  I feel like as if we need eachother, as if we are meant to be, and I'm sorry if I am a dissapointment to you, or came out different then you expected.
When I say you've changed me, and you are, you are. I'm being honest, but I can't help looking down on myself, and seeing you treat others as if they're better sometimes gives me old childhood memories.
being the ""different kid"" the one who wasn't really ""wanted.""I would talk more, but I'm usually ignored.Also, YOU. I need to talk about you, with the name with the B in it. You don't realise how much you hurt my daily life... I am now afraid to even go to school, since I am looked down upon now due to your stereotypes for me, although it may seem funny to you, it's not to me.
Because I have to deal with it everyday, wishing I was someone different. You're treating me as if I am not human, which is now making me think this, and nobody even knows how I feel, not online, not in real life. Because I'll be looked at differently. It's already stained. I can't help who I am, but I know that it's possible to get to your own happinesses.
Whether it's throwing chairs at me, publicly humiltating me, and even punching me, hitting me, breaking my things, I feel happy because you're getting your own satisfactory, even if I sit and I cry, nobody cares to take up for me, and that's how it's always going to be.
I've come home broken in tears over what you've done to me, due to who I am. I hurt myself, and I hide it, because nobody needs to have a lower opinion on myself, since you're so high up there with your popularity. I've had family fights over you, and it's made me paranoid to even leave my house to see you, and I don't wanna go back to school to see you or others either. I look down the hallway, with my head down, wishing nobody would look at me.
I hate who I am, and who I've become, and I've tried finding light in the lives of others, it's slowly working, I hope. I can see a dim light, I hope I can make it. Even if you stand in the way, it's fine. You are getting what you need. You are bigger, and stronger, I'm smaller, and less cared about, I have lots of reasons to be hurt for who I am.
I remember what it was like being hit. I remember being in panic, tearing up at my table, and you running off laughing with your group at me, and it became everyday, stealing my stuff, everything. I didn't care. I couldn't do anything. I've tried to sit with others, and ask for help, but you've made me feel like I can't. I've cried, and I've died on the inside, I've tried to stand up, but I'm so horrible at being mean. I've lost my anger, It's just faded into self-deprivating sadness. You'll never know my life outside of your jokes that affect me. You'll see it as a gag to hurt the ""gay boy"" because I'm always alone, and have nobody.
It is funny. It is. I've come to laugh at myself too. Even if I am scared of seeing you, and others, I know they won't help. THEY will not help. I'm not to be dwelled on. I remember you coming to my locker, and pushing me, and hitting me in the back of my head, smacking my phone, and getting close to me, and having others stare at me, as if I was a monster. I ran to class crying, but I had covered it up. I'd rather let nobody know. I've tried, no outcome. I've failed as a person, as a partner, as a son. I'm truly sorry.sighTray, I know you hate me.  I know I'm against what you think about me, but I've come to agreeance with it. Even though I DID NOTHING TO YOU, I feel like I deserve what I get from you.
All of the abuse, the drama, I deserve it. Even all those plans to ruin my life, and kill me. They were worth it. I know you and your friends plan things behind my back. If you want to hurt me, you can. You have already, so why not do it again? You've pressured suicide on me, and I've tried. More than twice, which I know makes you truly happy to see the only person who loved you die, or at least want to. I'm glad I can bring you the happiness you've always wanted. Everyone's come to believe your rumours, and I retchedly have a dark feeling for you in my heart. Although, it's all self-based. It's my mistake to end up like this, and I've tried to fix it, but your fucking selfishness ruins it.To all my old friends who have left me.I'm sorry I've annoyed the living shit out of you, I know who I am, and I know I can't help it. I'm not worth any of those tears you cried either, if any of you did. I'm sorry I've pulled this image onto myself. I'm not sure what I've done, yet I've assumed, and I think I'm right. The feelings I've harboured were like no others with friendship, putting so much in, trying hard, at least an effort. And I get turned down, treated as if I was never born, or existed. All of those things I've done have ended up in ash, and worthless. I can't help going out, and getting a memory of you, or one of you. It hurts me, and I try to find you guys again to talk, I miss you. You don't miss me though. I can see why. You've found better people, I'm replaceable, and I can see it happening with many people, replaced by those who hate me.From now on, I will continue my life still putting my feelings underground. I've lived up to my stereotpye anyways trying to help myself.  I try to ignore the pain inside, and one by one, part of me slowly feels distant, and the smile, and emotions I've harboured, are fake, I can't let you know the way I feel, I don't need any of your sympathy, the vicious words are slowly killing me, I try so hard to bring empathy and joy, while hiding behind the lie that has become who I am.
I just can't sleep, that one of you is gone, and I'm afraid of losing others. The wounds you've left never heal.
I know you won't change, you've got the same look on your face, things will never be the same (B)  I feel your pain, you hurt me, but I won't ever object. As like a fool, I will smile through the tears, your own personal, lovable fool.
Time fades away, like yesterday. The thing I hate the most is something I can't do.
I can't ignore him, I try to.
Once more, my voice might be able to even reach the future, already collapsing.
Your voice has surely reached me, making the ignored one me, the selfish one me. The number one thing I hate is
how I can't do anything
How much of a coward I am
How I give up
and how selfish I am
Even if there is no meaning, even if I understand, it's not easy to admit.
""bonds"" washed away by carless whitewash.
Even when I want to live in the world, there's not any kindness. I hide behind the feelings of fear, sinking into hope and despair. Who do I turn to?
I offer to you, not knowing anything at all, I continue still to walk the earth, no matter how many times done,  comes and goes, recyled, though the world isn't asking for anything. It's beauty harassess me, making me wish I was kinder in the morning. It's okay to pretend to be happy, because I want to be satisfied.I want to share my feelings, and I had made it into a shape, yet it's been broken many times over my own faultiness, and I am able to repair my own mistakes.
If... if you had the ears that I posess, I'd sing you a song, or at least try to, straight from my heart, and if you had posessed the same heart as I do, then I would flood you with all the love I have, but would you even feel?
If you are predisposed to hate me, please kill me now, and end the misery. (B)I can't gain anything at all.You don't need me at all (evr)I don't need to reach your deafened ears, or to fill your heart.
""a dissapointment"" I was said to be, but where am I in the distant future anyways ?
I carried away alone, wherever I run, wherever I hide, I am laughed at, I don't dare to even look back. New day, 2.So, my nickname has been changed. I'm no longer something sweet, just my regular name, although, you said that it was to prevent people mixing us up, I've noticed that it doesn't happen a lot, and despite me changing it back, you put it back.
Sometimes I feel like you do it to attract other people to you, so then you can say ""I don't have a partner.""
But then again, it's probably me overthinking. I hope it's the opposite of what I'm thinking, I really love you.Day two, continued.Okay, so what I had expected, just happened. I'm fine to see you go, I know it makes you happy. even if it hurts me. this explains a lot. I've given into your life, and I was blinded by your love, and not having any really true feelings. I've done a lot, and not noticed. I mean, I'm fine to see you go, it's happened so many times it's just become something regular in my life.
I do feel sad, and I feel remorse, but your voice has surely reached me. I know life will get harder. It will, worse things will happen, but this will build up, and I will keep everything special we had together, even if it didn't work out, although I was blinded thinking it was, letting my anxieties and fears and bring people and I love down. Selfishly, I will live on.Cass - Today at 7:21 PM

Why me?
Why me...it has to be me...
I'm so close to the edge.
I've been filled with lies.���I remember when there used to be colors all over,
and I could wake up and barely open my eyes,
Having a simple mind,
Feeling so euphoric,
Not knowing what later lurks in my lifetime,
Wanting to stay in this moment always,
Now my days are fading every time i blink,
Foreseeing images,
Flashing in my head,
Violent voices,
Wanting me dead,
Opened eyes start to burn now,
The sun is just too much
And when I close them the darkness engulfs me�ۍ
What's going on? It's getting hard to breathe. I'm torn open,I'm on my knees, asking you to stay and not to leave.
Please Don't go, Please Don't go...updatehey, apparently this text document is the only one that can handle me.every day is getting worse, nobody is talking to me, and yet now I've noticed i'm losing others.
I'm crying right now, wishing i could end all of my sadness. and anxieties.  I've realized how lonely I am, I hate myself so much.
I can't help who I am, i wish i could fully change who I am. I want to restart. I need to, It's been so long without someone really....
I dont really have friends, they're all out with other people. I understand why...
nobody really cares to save me from my self hate...Since you have left me things got worse, I have been hurt more and I want to find a hero.Yet, I have seen things I do not want to, things I have done I don't want to. That I will only tell myself.
Yet you come backa sking for much, yet you don't even feel the same.You tell me you hope this and hope that
later telling me different
saying I am doing this and that
calling me this and that
making me feel useless.The stroke of heat across my body with anxiety and self conciousness overwhelmes me.Even the thought of me being nice to you and me saying I'm assuming things, when i am not, hurts.I am not assuming. I want an answer, and I feel like it's true, I make myself believe it. You don't understand. I am hurt by your changing feelings.Beaten, Robbed, Threatened while you were gone.��������܋�䋁ԋ�ы�_��ы�_�����܋��ہ����ҋ�_��_�__�����_��㋁�����ҋ�ʋ⍋�����
""I don't love you anymore.
Since when?
Now. Just now. I don���t want to lie.Can't tell the truth, so it's over.
It doesn't matter. I love you. None of it matters.
Too late. I don't love you anymore. Goodbye.""""Yes. I would have loved you... forever. Now, please go. Show me! Where is this love?
I... I can't see it, I can't touch it.
I can't feel it. I can hear it. I can hear some words,
But I can't do anything with your easy words.
Whatever you say is too late.
Please, don't do this!
Done.""Now that I look back, counseling never really did help, it helped me be someone else, regretting my own past. I've become more weary and open to my own feelings and sadness,
past being within a sociopath's manner. I care too much. It's the problem. Having my own crisis, looking for my own future, and I can't even find it, or the paths, I feel like as if it's blocking me. Meant to be this way. I can't find anything; I'm not suited to be my own self anymore. I want to make it; I can't, everythings holding me down. I feel like making a animatic based on my feelings, yet realizing not even having talent no matter how hard effort
is put into it.���we need to talk.�ۍ i know what that means.
never good.
at all.
you know that.I hate the fact that you treat me like I'm one of yours then you turn around and hit me and the ones you love, and scream at me like it's my fault
I am the way I am and what happens to me.please dont push me out of your group because im not the same
i am willing do do anything to be part of you and all of you
even if i have to do something thats already happeningim willing to hurt myself to make others happy
because im not happy with myselfI can't be fixed.recent update.
I think I found him.
He's amazing in completely every way.
he understand fully who I am
although he may have his own flaws
he is perfect to me.I can't ever thank him so much
every day is getting better
im not hurting anymore. Yet I do still hurt, it's not as bad as before..
am I feeling true love?
is this what I was meant to feel?
Is this who I really am?
if so, I am proud of myself for becoming myself with the help of someone who really likes me for who I am.
he isn't blinded by my problems, he knows fully
it drags me to tears to know he understands.
I love him so much.
I hope I can see him one day and cry within his arms.
I think I have found my one and only gate to my own eutopia.I love him, I can't say it enough.
These tears won't stop as I put my love into this note. He means everything to me, although, the days we spend get better and better.
If I'm down, I ALWAYS remember what he tells me.
It's like magic.Will not let my own circumstances firghten me, no tortures. Looking upon the apperances will be the path of enternal euphoria.I've come to realization that it's okay if the only thing i did today was just breathe and sitI have to remind myself that what I do is unique, and although it will be hated, and looked down upon, hopefully pride will be found within my own actions soon enough.My story isn't over yet.I can shine brighter than the dark that has ever came across me, like the night, transforming into my own sun, for me, for others. One of the heardest things to ever learn was that I was worth recovering. And I'm doing it, finally.""I wish I could show you when you are lonely or when you are in darkness the beautiful light of your own being"" Telling myself being able to is courage.Not being created to be guilty, or in defeat.
I am created to be in victory.Recent update
I still hurt but I've become immune, I've found happiness, and I hope it lasts. I've mostly found it through one person at first, but it's reached out to many people. I hope it stays like this, gradually better everyday, getting close to even leaving this shithole. I'm proud of myself for being this strong and finding someone who actually gives two shits about me and understands. I'm glad I have friends, I am glad I am cared about. I am who I am, and when I hurt, it's not as bad anymore. It's not as if a knife is hurting me, just more as of a soft punch. I have to thank you so much for making me this way, and I will do all I can do defend you in your honor and within my own love. Because you're the exact same. We are the exact same. Love each other. <3Okay, I know my love is going through a bad time. I love him so much, and even when he's drunk he tells me the straight truth. That's a real man.
Lately I've been I have been giving out this diary. I am quite happy I am getting better, Im happy I can leave soon. I love the feeling of being independent.
I hated when my dad hit my mom at before ipc.
it was so embarassing. I feel bad for my best friend cuz I hide things from everybody but they kinda know the truth now. I love them a lot for a friend. Maybe they're my only true one.  He means more to anything to me, Q.Anything beautiful people want to break.
And I am afraid you are beautiful.
Stay strong <3I'm so thankful for this fandom.I have found myself and people who love me.
Without it I don't know where I would be. So many friends, so many smiles, so many good times.
I love this fandom.Sigh....
I love him, yet he's slightly hurting me...
He ignroes me... I dont even exist anymore...
Where is love? I can't feel it see or touch it...I can't take your sympathy anymore, you don't even try....
You'd rather have others....
You hurt me but you dont even know.
I don't complain.Like a fool, I smile through the tears with a fake mask...
I thought you were the one......
I wished upon a star for you the day before I met you...
Why me?feeling more suicidal than before.If only I could love you enough to give you what you need.
If only I could be for you, the hand that feeds you.If only I could make you believe you deserve everything.You're angry, D.I know you are.You mostly are all the time and I know I am part of it.
I tell you I'm sad, you get pissed.Then you throw fits around the house, cursing, and throwing stuff, breaking objects, breaking feelings.
Day by day, being ignored grows stronger.
My love doesn't even talk to me anymore.
D ignores me.
I look outside and I think ""nobody is there for me.""I'm stuck.
and I'm tired of being here.""You don't need people."" they say
How can I not need someone when I can't even make myself happy?
I can't share anything with anybody.
Why can't I love?I just wanna say

im just..
done.my heart is slowly collapsing.NEW UPDATE
8/22/17I'm not proud of myself for what i've started to do.
I've gotten more into drama by accident and ive given into things I shouldn't.
I've started drinking, and it's made me feel so much more happier, yet i still feel so bad.my friends had found out about it and are really pissed off at me.
I'm losing everyone due to my own self again.
I can't help it, and i get the urge to drink now and then.
I want to push more maybe, I don't know.
I'm scared but I want something to alter everything to make it seem as its my own paradise. School sucks, I've been failing more, I don't feel like I fit in, nothing's working out.
I was told I wouldn't graduate
J and A are in some tough times, getting M,C,S all raveled up in fights, tearing all of us apart and im stuck in the middle, since i dont take sides, but i hide all my emotions, none of them believe me.I feel as if I am living my youth in grey, not being lively.I'm jealous of those who live life in the moment without having to worry about consequnces.My friends are just leaving one by one from lots of reasons, stemming from others, and at least a small percent from my shitty personality.I've thought about self harming again, but different.New update.september 1st..So you are severly disappointed in me. I thought you'd be supportive...
You said I can tell you anything, and i came out.
Instead all you did was be pissed and not agree with me, and acting like im not one of you.""i'll put you in therapy again""
""i'll put you on medicine""
that hurts me a lot.
I want to be myself.
I can't live on without having acceptance without my life being controlled.
I thought you guys would love me no matter what. Honestly, I'm not proud of who I am.
I get asked
""you proud to be gay?""
I tell them.They get suprised...
It's because I've faced so much  to not be proud of...
I'm different, and thats bad...I'd like to believe I'm not, I haven't seen proof. So I don't debate it anymore. It's like spending my life over and over thinking something will change, it's absurd.I don't want to be alone.The painful truth is, even when people say they support something, but don't support you.
that hurts.
It's hypocritical.
Hypocrisy is a crime.
I just want to love and to be loved.
Instead I just bottle up everything.One day, they'll all forget about me.I'm a sack of shit and everybody knows it.I'm the earth's sack of shit.Mostly,, just....   want this to be over with, even though my life is controlled by you, and i'll never be an adult, i'll never see the light through this topic of me being myself, at least fully. September 2nd.This day was even worse..
My dad ignored me.
Not even a word.
Was supposed to have my only friend over, I had to tell her not to come over due to my dad going off.Turns out I'm 100% sure he is disappointed in me, with his smart ass sarcasm.throwing shit at me, making me feel degraded.
I loved you, and all you had to do was hurt me
can i even call you my dad?You break things, including my own heart.Today, i was nothing to you, just like every week.it's even worse all that you care about is the mind altering things you do.I hate it how everytime I get sad like this, things seem to get better, and I regret typing or saying bad things about him, then it repeats. I need to stop this.I know the truth about my father, he's....
hiding a lot.he hides behind his ""happy"" maskmost of the times hes happy, hes just.. pissed and ready to attack. I'm scared...
I'm scared of the ones who...  ""love me""i love how you justgot mad on my birthday
ignored meim not important anymore to you..your outburts happen so many times im tired of assuming or thinking about itupdate.
you sped off,and im alone.
i think its time i show myself its my fault now.and it'll be over, the feelings i have.
I'm not ending it, i'm just... punishing myself for now.9/20/2017
I've been feeling a bit better, but then again another thing i did, and i tripped and i fell into another spiral of darkness, but when i got everything figured out, i hurt another person by accident and i made them lose hope and all trust in me, ghosting me completely and not even noticing i exist. im such a fucking asshole for my self harm habits and venting. ��_��ы����ξ����΋�_�_������������ʋ��

The festival is in town.
I have a crush I love.I somehow can not get the balls to talk to him. I have in person, and I've told him a lot, but I think he doesn't like me anymore. It's been about 2 days and he hasn't even opened my messages, yet he looked at my story. I don't know if he wants to talk anymore, and we got so close.
I heard he likes me back as well.I feel so unloved and unwanted to, I remember the ones I love there were fighting, and people were divided, I had gotten called out a couple times, and that and I was ignored, that and I am getting stared at because of my shitty social anxiety.I started cutting again, this time its worse. I cut deeper, and I'm scared.It's okay though, the adreneline is enough to keep me happy.
I feel nothing without them.I don't know what to do...I feel so alone, even when I'm crying in front of thousands of people, nobody will ever notice what's wrong.My grades went down, and I feel like a dissapointment..
I heard the guy I like likes me, but he won't speak to me anymore.. I hope for the best, honestly....sigh,  I've been feeling quite suicidal, but I'm too scared to do anything, but the more I cut, the better I feel.I'm sorry."
One of my dream jobs denied me,I don�۪t know what to feel right now. I�۪m in a perpetual want to cry mode but won�۪t cry and it feels like there�۪s a me under my skin that can�۪t move but it trying to move. I just Im trying not to move as much cause I don�۪t know what I�۪ll do
You can imagine how fucked up my life is when I m writing this in my journal,"""Note to self: The world is full of shit. Leave it soon if you can't, then pity yourself."" "
Today's the day that I kill myself.,"I've been writing this in my head and on Reddit everyday for the past few weeks. I always erase it out of fear, but not anymore. And if by any chance, this post breaks the rules, I apologize. With that said, on to my post we go. For starters, I haven't been able to eat all that well these past few days and have gotten quite ill because of that. I actually felt okay during the initial days of my sickness. What I mean is that I didn't actively plan my death as much. I wouldn't mistake that for being happy though. I think it was just the fact that I was too unwell to even get out of bed and I was focusing on being sick.Anyway, I feel as though I need to go through with it today. Does a person typically leave a reason in their note? Well, it's a bit more complicated than that for me. There's not exactly one reason to why I've decided to kill myself,  but I will say that each and every reason is my own fault. No one else's. Nope, it's all my own. However, I will say that when I do die, everything will inherently be so much better for all of my family/pets. No more living off of their hard earned funds and under their safety of their home. No more destroying them with my intolerable and disgusting ways of living. I'm a slob and I mean a true slob. I'm rather unintelligent and unattractive. Short and stubby, overweight, and unimportant perfectly describe me. My own mother didn't want to have me as a child because of all of my faults... I can't say I blame her though. I'm just progressively destroying every relationship with anyone I've ever been close to. I'm so sorry. I've come to decide that killing myself is truthfully my only option. I won't go to therapy as there really isn't anything wrong with me. I'm looking at it from a logical standpoint... Everyone really is better off without me and I shouldn't burden them with my continued existence. I'm younger, I'll admit, but I'm still legally an adult and in the end, it's my choice. This is my only choice. I can't change, I fail every time. Either I'm unbelievably lazy or I simply just can't change. I know I've tried though, but as of late, I've given up. So, I'm going to hang myself. Not this exact moment as I need to relax. I feel like my heart is beating right out of my chest, whether it be from me being sick or not, it's not a nice feeling. Once the feeling subsides, I'm going to go through with my plan. It'll be today though, I'm confident in that. It has to be today. No matter whether I want to die or not. I have to.To all of my family and pets, thank you for everything you've all done for me. I know that I was horrible and I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know that at first, my death won't be easy, but time will pass and you'll see how much better it is for all of you. Even if you can't see it, trust me... It's better. I can't express this enough, everything that's happened isn't your fault and it'll never be your fault. I am so sorry... So sorry. I love you all endlessly. Please forgive me."
"One step forward, ten steps back","Everything keeps getting worse. I don't know what to do. I have nowhere to go, I have no one to talk to, I don't really have any good reasons to stick around. I don't know where else to go. I have nothing left."
I was alway the runt of the litter in my family,"Everyone else got so much attention, specifically for mental health. I was ignored though in obvious pain. WTF? My parents just sat there and watched me suffer all of my teen years, and they knew I was in pain"
I've got my note written...,"I've been here for 20 years, and I'm ready to go. I know that's short compared to the average lifespan, but god I've live so much life. I'm happy and at peace with everything, and I just feel like it's my time."
I don�۪t see another option,"So long story short. My wife and I have three kids together.She�۪s cheated on me once. I forgave her (after a year and court intervention) and because my oldest begged and pleaded, I gave in and we tried to work on it.Her literal line of dialogue was ���daddy. All I want for Christmas is my family back together�۝. Fast forward to now, literally almost a year to the day later.She�۪s doing it again. I finally had enough-and called her out on her bullshit. Literally if there was a check list for cheating spouses. She�۪d mark every box-some a few times. The dude fessed up to it,  to a degree (more than I can say about the last douche).  He said he�۪d leave it up to her to tell me. It ���wasn�۪t his place�۝.So now after MONTHS of putting up with it for the kids. I couldn�۪t.  I genuinely couldn�۪t. The feeing of being ignored, Second choice. Seeing him try to act like daddy 2.0 to my kids. Seeing them at first reject him, then start to gravitate to him. It was the stupidest set of events that set me off.My oldest bike chain locked up. She went to him to fix it. Not me. Then I was on the phone with a coworker, and she thought I said something to her. I specifically said to the coworker ���what the fuck did you do?�۝. She thought I was talking to her and jumped down my throat. That broke the camels back. I confronted them both. Together. She blew up at me and drove off. Now I�۪m here alone with the kids, no idea what to do. If I have a home (our house belongs to her family)I�۪m only here because I don�۪t have a firearm. Otherwise I would have offed myself when it started"
In need of some encouragement,"I'm two days into college and feeling awful, as I'm sure lots of people are. I miss my ex so much. I'm in a small town and she's in the city I spent all my life in. I've never had thoughts of suicide until tonight, when I went on a walk and found a really peaceful bridge by the water. I doubt I'd ever attempt but I ended up looking at the water for about half an hour. I don't want this to be my life. I need to vent and hear that everything will be okay. Nothing feels worth doing without her. "
Just another post,"It�۪s the first time I openly talk about the idea of suicide.Right now I�۪m fighting so many things. I have serious familiar problems.
I really don�۪t know how to go on. Sometimes I realize that if I don�۪t give up I�۪ll have a successful life. The only thing I have to do is waiting. I can�۪t do it. Sometimes I just find myself crying. It�۪s so difficult to understand what I feel. I only want to end everything."
Tonight is the night I end it all. Nothing left and no one to care.,"I've lost everything, no family, no friends, no job, no life. I've got nothing left to live for and no one to go on caring for. I've made up my mind and this is the end. I needed to say this somewhere because no one will ever find anything I'd write on paper. "
Fellow Redditor needs help, has made several posts and needs help from us today. Some have been deleted but here's some others:
no hope for me gonna be a loser for life :(((((( someone please talk to me,Hello:))))))
I'm planning on doing it in 20 minutes,I'm starting to feel desperate I don't even know if I should tell my friends since I only know them through the Internet and they'll figure out I'm dead or something eventually anywayI'm so scaredEdit: I don't know if it means anything to add this but I didn't do it. Still in a nasty state of mind. But I didn't do it.
I'm sick of feeling like my feelings aren't real unless they're experienced in a certain way,"So maybe killing myself will convince me that I really am sufferingEven if I'm not ""really"" suicidalI don't know I just wish I was someone else. And I know no one will give a shit about that. They'll just say ""be yourself"" and leave it at that. Because obviously your persona that annoys people isn't going to cause problems because people will accept you for who you are for some reasonThis life is pointless, after all. I don't do anything. I have no motivation, no confidence, nothing. I don't know why I manage to go on.Maybe it doesn't matter if what I'm experiencing is ""real"" or not. But then I'd have no reason to do this. Or maybe it doesn't matter to have a reason? Jesus I can never keep things consistent in my mind. Maybe this would be a good thing. Even if it would hurt everyone....What's the point in trying if I lack to strength to do whatever I want without worrying about being judged or failing.I wish I was a guy and I can't even convince myself I'm transgender because I don't experience it like most of them do. I don't have fucking gender dysphoria. I'm deluding myself. Yet I'd bother killing myself over it.Why am I so dramatic? I'm not cringing irl, I just feel...empty? is that the right word?...but if I did feel a bit more I'd be cringing.Meh.I still have some life in me. I could bother saving myself, but I don't feel like it. Now is the perfect opportunity to just...do something...about it...I act like an annoying main character in a book. I use ""I"" too much, I feel different from everyone else (and focus on it so much that I fail to see how my feelings are legitimate), and I whine too much about it. I just want people to feel bad for me. I want to show them I'm suffering, that my life sucks, that I'm really this great special person that everyone should love because I have no bad intentions yet I troll my own friends when I feel jealous...the wanting sympathy part, honestly, it's probably another reason for the impostor syndrome shit...because I AM faking it, somewhat...Maybe feeling like I'm faking it is fake too, like I'm doing THAT for attention. I know I'm posting on reddit for attention. I know I'm killing myself for attention. Everything is just a cry for help. I annoy friends (I hardly talk to them about this sort of shit anymore because I feel like I'm such a burden for them) so I go to reddit and I literally post shitty things to strangers and expect sympathy. Obviously I don't always get it. I've used multiple accounts. I've acted far too dramatic. I've basically been a stupid little bitch. Bitch doesn't even feel like a good word for me. I'm practically the opposite of a slut. I purposely make myself look ugly to rebel against the shitty way society views women: they're sex toys with thin revealing clothing with too much makeup and they have to shave in places where men don't have to. Fuck that.I need to end it. I don't want to keep going in circles. I just want to forget about everything and not have to be reminded by my own brain about all the crappy things I've done, the shitty event in my life which might be considered traumatic as I ironically feel a lot worse over it than the day my mom died, but it's all self-inflicted. But no one will fucking get it. And if I dare talk about it, my identity is at risk of being exposed, even though I wasn't that popular..I'm not really suicidal I'm just selfishWho gives a shitI mean I'm depressed, right? But I haven't even seen a therapist so how the fuck do I know if part of that isn't made up tooWait why am I calling part of it real...probably because I know I have something...it's just not legit anymore...I don't know if I'll actually do it. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Like most times where I didn't, I felt too shitty and lazy to do homework, and I'll fail my math test tomorrow, and I don't know...I don't want to see the light anymore and convince myself not to die...isn't that wonderful? Not really. But it sounds incredibly stupid...like, again, I'm making this all up, because I LIKE feeling the pain, otherwise I would've taken steps to improve my mood...like getting enough sleep and eating healthily and shit..I'm not suicidal why am I doing thisFuck everythingI may or may not do this maybe I'll just chicken out because I'm a loser I don't knowI think reincarnation exists though so maybe I'll be able to try againI hope I won't fuck it upMy name is Victoria and I'm a confused selfish dramatic loser. At least if I did this, it would be the last time I hurt people. Even if it hits them hard. It would be the last. And they'd get over it."
Life is too much,"In the last 5 years my life has been hell. Went into business with family aged 21, got fucked over,  cheated and ripped off by a lot of people, nearly had my marriage split up over it. My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it. My husband moved to the other side of the world for a new job, and I'm meant to go over too so I have two weeks to try and finish it, find a renter and get ready to move to a different country and I just don't see it happening. Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time. I want to finish it but I don't want to upset whoever will find me, that is literally the only thing that stopped me tonight. Still trying to be too damn considerate of other people. So I guess I'll just go down a bottle of wine and see what tomorrow might bring or if I'm lucky I just won't wake up. "
Life isn't worth the suffering,"Wageslaving, depression, anxiety, ptsd. I just want to die. If there is a god somewhere, just kill me now."
Reincarnation sounds amazing. The idea of a restart just by killing myself is too tempting,"I keep hearing stories that if you die and you get a restart. What I would give to restart my whole life knowing what's going to happen to me.Even if it isn't true, death would better than my life now. I was bullied for 10 years where I was pushed around and called names and all the effort I put into my studies and club which resulted in average grades and a meaningless certificate. I lied to people that I had good grades before because it hurt admitting that there were nights I stayed up studying weeks before my major exams and it meant nothing.I finally got out of that shit hole and I wasted my chances. People kept complimenting me and I got arrogant and my short temper got the best of me. My first friend I made in my new school was amazing. She was there whenever I felt down and there for me when people pushed me around. But she couldn't stand my attitude. Everyone kept warning me but only until I lost my friend did I realise what an asshole I am.If I jump, the pain would end at worst and at best, I get another shot to make things right."
My note is always bad and wrong just like me,"This fucking note just never sounds authentic and I don't know what advice to put after my death like wills, what to do with my body,  song to play at my funeral and stuff like that. I can't even put what I feel into words so is anyone ever going to forgive me. But I can't live in agony! Been to councilling but it tells you things are difficult just power through them and that's it,  I mean it's good for some just not me, I've been told I will always feel like this I've just got to cope but I can't cope! Kill me!"
"People say things get better, but it's not like I'm ever going to stop hating myself","I'm sure that any problem I have with college, trying to find a job, or relationships is temporary, but I hate myself and I always have. I hate this depression, I hate how ugly I am, I hate how shy I am, I hate how scared of everything I am, I hate the random rage fits I have. There's nothing that I like about myself. And why should I expect that to change? I can't just get rid of all these flaws, they're all part of me. I hate myself more than anything on this planet. Every day I imagine taking a bunch of pills and ODing, but I don't have any to do it with.I genuinely can't see why people like me. Like I have close friends who really like me and I have no idea why. I suck."
I'm on my last limb,I'm trying so hard to hang on. I'm losing myself. I was driving home today and I pulled over on the highway and had to stop myself from running into the street. The urge gets harder and harder to ignore every day.
I literally don't know,"I can't explain what I'm feeling to anyone. It's the usual; I have few friends, none of them care about me, I have a terrible family, I have no motivation to do anything at all, closeted gay in a homophobic environment, obese and unattractive. But I don't get it these things are all common I know I'm not the only depressed person in the world but I know that I don't relate or feel like any of them. I've never been passionate about anything more than just dying. I feel like I don't even want it to get better like I'm literally lusting over dying but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I've really tried talking to people,  but I'm aware of how much bullshit is passed on just to make people ""realize they don't actually wanna die"" which is true for some people but is it possible to be in a situation where death is the only option? I just really really hate the idea of being alive and I'm not even kidding the only thing keeping me alive is not being able to do the actual deed. Not because I don't want to but because I'm scared of it. I feel like I have plenty of reasons to be depressed yet none of them are what makes me want to be dead. It feels like I'm just not meant to be alive in some way and it's soo hard to explain this without sounding weird. Idek why I'm writing this, guess I needed to vent"
i want to be in pain,"sometimes my hands shake and i just want to smash them with a hammer. i talk to myself so much but i don't really ever have anything nice to say to myself, but i still feel like I'm a better friend to myself than anyone else will ever be. is there someone out there for me? sometimes i really hope not. i always convince myself that I'm best alone. any time spent on me is time wasted. i just want to die. I'm sure people would barely notice or care. it seems that when people say they feel bad that someone they knew, maybe at school or work, kills themself it's more selfish than they'd ever admit. does anyone really care about my life? or do they just care about the uniform routine of their own. i feel like everyone would be more sad that now something is different. people don't like change, but a lot of people don't like me either. so maybe my death would be a good change. the kind that everyone wants in their life. sometimes you want to become rich, maybe famous, maybe you just want to meet that special someone, you just want to be happy, you want your life to change in a good way. i feel like everyone around me could only ever be happy if i died slowly and painfully. maybe I'm their good change. not my life, but my death."
Why shouldn't I do it,"I've been in college for about a month now and it's the worst experience of my life. My grades are shit and they're only gonna get worse because I can barely motivate myself to get up in the morning and go to class. I have no friends here because nobody likes me (it doesn't help that I can't talk to people), the only friends I still have are two from high school and one of them hasn't talked to me in over a week. I've already set a date and I don't see why I should stick around when there's nothing here for me to live for. "
I can't take this anymore,"Hey I smoke all day/night when I'm off work by myself.
In the dark. With my dog and Netflix. That's when I'm happiest and I'm okay with that. Please don't hurt yourself. I often feel unwanted too but  after I smoke, I realize that I've let my mind wander & trick me. You're in control. I hope you find peace. "
I'm afraid I might end up killing myself,"Okay, so I'm not really new to reddit but this is my first time talking about this on this site. Just needed to get this off my chest.I'm just a couple months away from graduating college, but I'm under a lot of pressure right now and my anxiety is out of control. I'm having suicidal thoughts and I'm really scared. The same thing happened when I was about to graduate high school. First came the anxiety, then there was a suicide attempt, and then the worst depressive episode I have ever experienced in my life. I don't want to kill myself as of right now, but the idea seems less and less irrational as time goes by. I feel like I could just lose it at some point and just do it without really thinking that much."
i feel too much all the fucking time,"I have had debilitating anxiety and OCD since I was a kid. At one point it became so overwhelming, I fell into a horrible depression and tried to commit suicide. Years later I am no longer depressed, at least I don't believe so, but very often still want to kill myself. Part of it is my OCD. Some of my intrusive thoughts are suicide based. But a lot of it comes from the fact that the anxiety and OCD entirely rule my life. I can't get through college because I can't turn in papers and I can't navigate certain social situations because I can't seem to talk. Everything is too overwhelming.
With no perceivable future and the shame that comes along with that, I just find myself wondering all the time if it would just be easier just not to exist anymore. "
Running out of ideas,"I feel like my entire life has just been distractions and  procrastinating until one day I'll run out of ways to put off suicide. Im sick of saying I'll just wait one more day. I don't want to try anymore, I'm so exhausted. I cant remember a time before I was depressed, there has always been something wrong with me. I wish I could rely on someone else for a few moments but I'm too much of a burden to carry. I ruin everything I touch and have no future. I can't keep doing this. "
I don't know why this is happening to me.,"Everything was going great. I was really happy with life for the second time in my life. (The first time was 2015 summer and it felt like I was in heaven.) I was feeling great but something made me feel like this. I used to have real problems. I used to be alone at school and no one except for my few friends cared about me but now I am going to different school. I left everything behind. I don't have problems being alone anymore but still when I think ""What will happen next?"" I just get the view of me fucking everything up and I can't cope with it anymore every time I try to think about what I'm going to do I just say ""Kill yourself, the world doesn't need you anyway."" and I don't know why it is happening. I attempted 3 times and they all ended up with me saying ""Don't do it."" but I still want to do it. I just need some advice on how to cope with this. I can't tell this to anyone because my friends simply wouldn't care. I can't sleep I can't relax I can't do anything because a lot of my life is just me thinking what I would do next and you all know what happens when I think about that."
The ungrateful have everything and more,"Why is it that theres so many ungrateful people with families who love them, and all my life I've just been aiming to create a family who will love me back.There's girls with amazing hard working boyfriends and I can't even get someone to commit to me after two yearsEveryone lies to me. Everyone doesn't think I'm enough for them.I don't get why I'm here. People just use and hurt me. I don't want to feel this pain anymore.Everyone scares me. I have no trust in anyone no matter what. And my intuition is always right.I want to die so badly. And I have been wanting to for so long. I just want the courage to do it for once. I need to get it over with so this pain will go away. People have hurt me for too long and all I want is just for one person to love me. And no matter how hard I try, I can't even get that.It comes so simply to others but for some reason im unlovable. Why? I'm a good person. I go so far out of my way just to make sure I don't give someone the false intention that I don't care about their feelings. Yet people continue to use and lie to me. And take advantage of me and use me up until they've had their fun.I just want to die.
I have nothing to live for.
Probably going to cut myself as soon as I can find my scissors. That's the only thing that calms me down. My life is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I'm a loser. A failure. An idiot. I'm ugly, stupid, worthless. He was right. There's no use for me being on this earth. I pray I'll be able to get it over with soon. I'm tired of life. I'm tired of pain. I just want someone to hug me and help me. That's all. Why can't I have that. That's all I ask for. "
Suicide option is liberating,"I know this sounds odd, but it was so liberating when I determined that suicide was a realistic option for me. Now, if I lose my job, rather than trudge through the public embarrassment of losing my home and my family have to give up the cushy lifestyle we have now, or making them move to a strange city, there is a Plan B: suicide. I kill myself, and my family gets an instant financial windfall (more than I could provide in 10 years). So this realization has freed me up. Now, I'm like, fuck it. I started my own business on the side, because if it fails, who cares? At worst, I kill myself (which is an option). At best, I am successful and can make my wife and kids proud of me. Knowing that I can always kill myself has also freed me up in how I deal with people too. I've cut my abusive father out of my life because, well, why not? If all goes to shit because I cut him out, I just ""pull the plug"" and end it.Odd way to look at it, but knowing that the worst thing that can happen is I die has liberated me in a way that nothing else has. Not that I'm encouraging anyone to commit suicide. Get help. Your life is worth living, even if mine (one day) won't be."
Been a while trigger,"I use to vent on here and the depression r reddit alot and for some reason I'd get alot of rude people commenting on my post but anyways I can't say that things have improved I had a rough time with the system when I started counseling last year I believe I don't know my mind is hazy,I had two horrendous experiences with my first two counselors and during this my father got sick and passed away then I was told that I couldn't go there for counseling anymore,later on my significant other left me and I suffered until I reconnected with my close friend again and they helped me seek counseling  but during this i got involved with someone who was bad for my mental health and I ended up overdosing again a few times,my friend was supportive at first  but they seemed to have burned out and I'm unsure if my current  counselor really cares about helping me.I don't really have much faith in the system after everything that I've been through."
Still not happy,"So I got a ""part time job"" but is actually a full time job, back doing hair while I'm in school. I was/am happy to be back working and thought it would be good for me while I'm in school, while I'm making great tips and decent money, in still not happy and think about suicide just as much If not more. I feel like nothing in life is going to make me feel like I'm doing something productive with my time, I feel like I want to end it before the semester is up, but I know I won't so I'll just keep staying suicidal and do nothing about it "
I'm just apathetic. What's the point of being here? I'm just here to make other people happy.,"So long story short, I had a boyfriend that I was crazy about. I was actually happy for once in my life and felt like life had purpose. We broke up after a year and a half about two months ago. He told me that he wanted to marry me. He almost proposed. He's now dating another girl for a month now and has told her he loves her and wants to marry her. I'm not naive to think he really loves her. The idiot just can't tell the difference between love and infatuation. Regardless, he's still a happy idiot and I'm miserable.So I'm going through the process of grieving. I went crazy and was very close to killing myself. The only reason I didn't is because of my family. I'm getting better. I've had moments where I've accepted it and am ready to move on. But the thing is, I think this is the best I'm gonna be until I find someone else. Like this is basically how I was before I met him. Just pretty apathetic about life. I'm starting to make friends, and trying to better myself. But for what? So I can force myself to tolerate this life so I don't kill myself to keep other people happy? I'm in law school and I'm trying to focus on the material, and do the readings. But I'm falling behind, because I just don't care anymore. I have to force myself to do this so I can get a job to support myself one day so I can tolerate this life. Sweet.Yeah maybe I'll meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did, but what happens when he leaves too? Like my ex almost proposed to me. Everyone in my family loved him. I thought everything was great between us. Then bam, he's fallen out of love with me. Like fuck, how am I supposed to trust after that? And what's shittier is that I still miss him. I tell myself over and over that I don't, but I do. I would probably take him back, even though I tell myself over and over that I wouldn't. Or what if I never meet someone that makes me feel that way again? That's what I'm most afraid of. If I wanted to be in a relationship again, I could. Just none of the guys have had that spark that I had with my ex. I don't know what that spark is, but I'm addicted to it. Like I literally could never get tired of being around my ex. Like I almost wish I was the kind of person who needed some space, because I probably wouldn't be so fucked in the head. But I could literally spend every moment with that person and feel happy. Of course there's fights, and it's not always roses. But even the shitty times with him, are better than these apathetic moments. Life felt like it had purpose. Now it feels like there's no point. Now it's just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people aren't sad. Which I mean I get it, it'd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness. But this isn't fulfilling. This is just being another number in the world. I wish I just never existed. That way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me. And I wouldn't hurt because I never would have known what life is. I wish I wouldn't have screwed things up with him. Yeah, he didn't buy me presents, or do things that I wanted to do. And that's shitty. That makes me a pushover and pathetic. But I was still happier being a pushover than I am for trying to have standards for myself. We aren't going to talk ever again. We aren't friends on Facebook anymore, and he blocked me on Instagram. The only communication I have left with him is just seeing his name pop up on the list of people who have viewed my snapchat story. And you know how pathetic I am? It makes my whole day when I see his name there. It's why I go out and try to have a life. So I can post pictures on there and so he'll see them. And then I feel depressed until he's looked at it. It's pathetic and sad. But that's what I am. "
Anything???,Is there anything I could take or do? I wish there was something I could take where i felt no pain. Just take it and go to sleep. I'm such a coward I know but man it would so much easier.
"Not a goodbye, just an acknowledgement","Hello.
I am relatively new to reddit, and it's a bit sad to say it's because of this subreddit I have finally decided to become an active user. Not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal, more in the sense that I've come to this website more and more to escape from my life. And today was the culmination of all of it, because I've found a place where I don't have to lie or pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm a compulsive liar; I suspect that is so because I want to retain a sense of control over my life, but that is a topic for another time.
I still don't feel comfortable enough to post my own story here. Not that I don't trust the people here, it's just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public, which i know is paradoxical, because it's a public anonimity, and everyone's intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves, but still, I have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror (that sounded really cringy, sorry about that).
What I really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations. The energy you guys dispense is your own, you are sharing these beautiful, sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding, that you can hear these scattered individuals' silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other people's. Your fight is your own, but the pain you feel is close to somebody else's. That loneliness, that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through, that feeling of an especially made pain for you, don't hold on to it, don't nurture it. Remember that many have beaten it, so can you, so can I, so can everyone in this subreddit.
I am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support. I know for a fact you've saved lives, but unfortunately people don't recognize you much for it, and i know that is not the point, nevertheless I admire your courage and perseverance. You are amazing, thank you!
For the ones in more precarious situations, the ones that write or read for support of their own, i have a bit of advice. Some days ago i was feeling especially down, so I decided to walk alone. I talk to myself a lot, so I kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself. I just know that at some point I started to run, with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general. It helped. There was a lot I had inside of me, and fortunately it helped. I have been worse than this, bound to my bed, empty and cold. I can feel that coming back. In those times, I tried suicide. Never managed to go through. But Im being completely honest, what kept me going was a violent hatred for life, fear and self-doubt. I dont have any self-confidence, so i just kept questioning my decisions. Strangely enough, that helped me get through that rough patch.
The conclusion Im trying to reach is, dont feel inadequate for your sadness, dont feel like a coward for being afraid, and dont feel like its your fault life is shit. I know its easier said than done, but truly, remember you, your body, your mind, whatever you want, its fighting for you to stay alive. Your knowledge of your situation may help you help others, your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody else's.  If so many have battled through, you can too, you've taken a beating, now use that blood to, uh, idk,  fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick.
And if you need, just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like.
Much strength my dudes, and wish me some too!"
Just want to go away,"I'm 17 years old, male, and I just want to go away, again. A few months ago i ran away from home because i was just done with life. I've never had a reason to keep on living, i just went through life without a goal. I used to have a good amount of friends but they left me a year ago, i made new friends and they left me too. My life has only been downs and periods of time where its 'alright', no positives, i dont feel joy in livingI also feel like i'm not allowed to make my own choices in life. I have to follow all the rules that a couple of random people have decided on. I dont really feel like I'm living my own life. But while i was running away from home i did feel like i had the freedom to do whatever i want. I liked that feeling, but the police found me after i sent my location to one of my best friends who ""promised not to tell the police"". I felt betrayed and felt even shittier than before. And since then (december 2016) i haven't had any positive moments in my life.I dont know what the fuck i want to do when im older, but i dont care anyway, we all share the same ending to our life: death. So why not end it now? Or just make your own choices in what you want to do? I really want to go away again, either running away or just making an end to it altogether. I know that some people will miss me, but i dont want to stay just so i can make others feel better. It sounds selfish, but i wouldn't care anyway if i were dead/gone. And most of my friends already left me anywayI just want to go away"
When you are the source of your problems,"Most often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them, like abuse, bullying, illnesses etc. But how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you? I do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often. Shame, embarrassment, regret and low-self worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity. I don't feel any sort of direct sadness, lonelines or grief, so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here. I often invalidate myself because of this. I feel like since every problem is caused by me, I'm not allowed to treat it like a problem. But I am still allowed to validate my feelings. This is a rational thought in my head, so I guess that's a good start, but I can't bring myself to feel it. I still feel ashamed, embarrassed, regretful and of low self-worth all the time.Does anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings?"
what's the point.,"i can't read. i can't write. i can barely think.
i can't keep up with the amount of reading and writing assigned to me. i'm overloaded.  i'm a 5th year student at university with really bad ADHD and depression, as well as PTSD, and i'm struggling to see the point.  i can't lessen my load or i wont graduate in may like i've been working towards.  i've been suicidal for years and i'm close to my breaking point.

"Lost everything because I'm a full blown narcissist. The woman of my dreams, a prospering career, friends that people dream of having. Every moment is painful and it only gets worse and worse. I want to end it but can't bring myself to do it. That human will to survive is unbelievable","why do you think you're a narcissist?  The way I understand things, the vast majority of narcissists would never admit it, which is why they can't ever get help.  And for donkey's ears, it was believed that there is no cure for narcissism but apparently the underlying cause is recently assumed to be profound shame.  So, heal the shame and cure the narcissism supposedly.But again, most narcs never admit it, which is why there's a high likelyhood that you're not.  So...  why do you think you're a narcissist?  "
I want to Die,"I've been depressed for a few years and I see no hope. My girlfriend is the inly thing stopping me from ending it all because I love her too much to do that to her. But sometimes it isn't enough. I really want to kill myself. I feel empty or I feel completely depressed, but I can't bring myself to do it because I'm too selfish. I just want all the pain to end. "
Hello SW,"I'll just dive right in to this.I've been contemplating suicide for almost two months now and plan on ending myself before the year ends. I've been struggling with depression for over a year now and was recently diagnosed with D.I.D., both of which have made my life a living hell. My parents are abusive, I feel further from my friends every day, collapsing into myself. Back in August my soulmate left me and ever since I've been plauged with PTSD-type flashbacks of when we were together. About a week ago I started hearing voices and hallucinating, I haven't gotten a diagnosis yet but I suspect it might be Schizophrenia. My health has been failing rapidly over the last few weeks, and every time I close my eyes I feel like I'm not here, like I don't exist. I don't see the point in going on and I don't care about wether there's an afterlife, and wether it's better or worse than life as is. I'm toxicly aggressive and it's ruined almost ever friendship I've ever been in. I just don't give a fuck about anyone or anything anymore. Not sure what prompted me to post this, but whatever. I'm not killing myself tonight, however I wish I had the courage to. If I had a gun I would have shot my brains out already. I've come to terms with the fact that at the end of the day all I'll be is another statistic and I would rather leave than give any more. I haven't told anyone in my life about my suicidal thoughts other than my shrink. I want to work up the courage to tell my best friend but I don't want to run the risk of losing him too. tl:dr I'm fucked in the head and too weak to get help or end it"
I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of my grandparents,"I inherited my dad's temper. I push everyone I care about away. I'm not someone people like to hear from. School is way too difficult for me. I'm definitely not smart enough for it. I'm ugly as fuck with tons of pimples. Even my ""best"" friend doesn't like talking to me lmao.There's just no point so yeah. I feel like when my grandparents die I'm probably going to follow them. I just can't stand any of this.I was molested and nobody wants damaged goods. When a guy gets molested people just back away. Nobody cares. Sure they feel bad but they don't want to be your friend or anything. Everyone looks at you differently if you tell them. There's no point in telling anyone. I just can't take it.I can't read anymore. My ADHD got really bad and I just can't focus on a book anymore. Or writing and any work. I just can't."
I just had to walk away from my last solid emotional support,"The person I loved most in the world spiraled into this self-destructive abuser, and I can't help her, at least until she starts caring about herself again.But she was my last solid piece of support in the world, and now I'm just a complete mental wreck, and I know every hour of the next week is just waiting to see if maybe something good will come from the seeds I have sown in other parts of my life, or losing hope and spiraling. But every moment of waiting is going to be another moment I just want to die."
i miss having someone to cry with,i used to have someone in my life who would cry just because they saw me crying and i miss that so much ha. now i just cry alone in the dark and it makes me cry even more. i just want somebody to care about me that much again but no one does and sometimes i feel like no one ever will again but maybe that'd be for the best i mean at least nobody would have to waste their time with a paranoid idiot like me. I'm still pretty young though so maybe I'll be fine. i never feel like i will though.
Can tonight please be the night I die of a freak accident,"I'm tired of waiting and trying all these therapists, psychiatrists, medications, etc. I'm tired of calling the suicide hotline only to be put in an even worse mood after. I'm tired of having literally no one to be with physically. I'm tired of longing for some kind of human compassion. I'm tired of going outside when cops are out there on the off chance they'd stop to ask me questions just so someone talks to me. I'm tired of wanting to eat as a way to cope with my depression, then feel too sick to eat any food given to me and end up wasting it. I'm tired of feeling exhausted from the moment I wake up to the moment I lay down because of no other reason than my medication, although I have to take it to feel ""normal"" yet I still feel just as shitty, maybe a little more numb. I'm tired of trying and receiving fake happiness only for the sadness to come back shortly after. I'm tired of being optimistic about everything especially when someone talks to me because I'm way too clingy and attach myself to someone who shows any kind compassion for me. I'm tired of being on the verge of crying but never actually being able to which results in all this shit building up and having no way to release it. I'm fucking tired and I want to fucking die already but don't have the fucking balls to kill myself."
THe past 6 months drained all of my energy,"I just wanna get this off my chest as I have nobody I'm willing to talk to about thisI had to deal with health problems for a long time. 8 years to be exact. I wasn't able to go to school or work. I sat at home all day and played games. I lost a lot of friends, was depressed and had my first suicide thoughts.
This is fairly irrelevant now but it may help to understand why I feel the way I do right now.In august 2016 I was finally able to start my apprenticeship as I was able to get my health problems under control. I was able to work and go to school. I gained new friends and good things happened in life. By february/march I was happy with how things were going for the first time in 8 years.But then in april, one of my best friends died in a motorcycle accident. He lost control over his bike and hit an oncoming bus head-on. He died instantly. This put me into a big hole. My health problems started again, I started missing at work. Sometimes I was in the office maybe 1-2 days a month. I had to take medication to even make it to school. I felt like complete shit during that time but did not have any suicide thoughts yet because everything else was going well.During that time I lost contact to a girl I like a lot. I don't have a crush on her or anything, I just like her a lot as a person. We talked and chatted a lot and everytime I was on the phone with her I was able to forget all my problems and it made me happy. We talked about all kinds of stuff but I never told her this story. But my constant asking to talk annoyed her a lot. I could sometimes tell it did especially cause I knew she wasn't doing too well herself at that time but I still asked because I was depressed, felt like shit and wanted to talk to someone, to her. She was the only person that could make me forget everything. Just before summer holidays we had a big falling out and we cut contact which made me feel even worse at first.I had 3 weeks of holidays in which I could relax and think a lot. It helped me forget everything and feel a lot better. But I couldn't forget her. So before going back to school, I texted her and we talked again. I told her the whole story hoping she'd understand why I acted like I did. I told her that I'm very sorry I was a burden to her in a time she had to deal with her own problems. I asked her if she could forgive me and give me a second chance. She said she'll think about it but 3 weeks later I know from a friend of her that she isn't really interested in keeping up contact with me anymore. I'm still in a big up and down rollercoaster from what happened in the past 6 months. Some days I feel great and the next day I think about how easy it would be to get rid of all my problems, to forget everything. I sometimes go days and weeks without being able to motivate myself for anything. I just wanna lay in bed all day and cry. But this with her, this is really the last straw for me. I have never met anyone who has such similar views about life and everything as I do. I really miss talking to her on the phone or just chatting all day long. I can't even put into words how much I regret everything I did. I wish I could undo it but I can't.I could never do it myself. I couldn't do it to my family, my friends and everyone around me. I know there will be better times eventually. I have everything I could ask for in life. But I'm almost hoping someone would run me over on my bike tomorrow and end my misery.Thank you for reading. I already feel a lot better. For now at least."
"My son, an 11 year old cat, had to be euthanized September 22nd.","My son, Sushi, was suffering, and could barely breathe due to fluid around his lungs. They, my vets, tried to extract it, but couldn�۪t reach it. I could either have transferred him to the emergency vet, which I can afford, to try and let them try to save him, with a prognosis if not surviving, or I could end his suffering via euthanization. I couldn�۪t let him suffer anymore, he�۪s my.. he was my baby boy. I suffer from PTSD, depression, and anxiety. My animals, two dogs, and.. Sushi, are my whole fucking world. They�۪re the reasons I get up every day, the reasons I am still alive, because I know nobody else would love them, and take care of them like I do. And now Sushi, my son, is gone, and there�۪s nothing I can do. I shouldn�۪t of given up, I should of tried. I didn�۪t want him to suffer anymore either, I feel like I failed him. I love him so much, I can�۪t believe this is happening, I keep thinking I�۪ll wake up with him in my arms, or see him come around the corner. I held him in my arms as he died, I saw him pass away. He didn�۪t want to die, he wanted to live. I shouldn�۪t of let them do it, but I didn�۪t want him to die in pain either. I can�۪t forgive myself, I can�۪t fucking stop crying and calling his name, I just want my son back, I would give anything to have him back, anything, I would sell my soul, I would give every limb, every dime of money, every possession, just to hold him in my arms, and know that he�۪s alive and well. I have never been in so much pain in my entire fucking life, I�۪ve never hurt this bad, ever. I�۪ve never felt so much guilt, so much pain, and I�۪ve been through hell so many times. I don�۪t want to be alive anymore, I�۪ve survived for Sushi, Angel, and Delilah, for so long, and nothing I�۪ve done was good enough, he�۪s gone and I can�۪t bring him back and it�۪s killing me, fucking killing me. People say it�۪ll get better; it won�۪t. I�۪m not that type of person, my animals are my children; they�۪re all I fucking have, and I live for them, literally. I work just to take care of them, to be able to get them good food, medical treatment when needed, I wake up to be there for them, I go through every bit of pain, just to be here for them. It wasn�۪t fucking good enough, I fucking failed him, i held him as he died, he didn�۪t fucking want to die, I could tell, he wanted to stay with me. I don�۪t know what to do it hurts so bad I can�۪t stop sobbing every fucking day I don�۪t want to work anymore, I don�۪t want to be alive anymore, I don�۪t want to suffer anymore, and I know I�۪ll never recover from this, I know I can�۪t get past this and I just lay here by myself thinking of him, holding his bed in my arms, his toys, the Halloween costume I bought for him, shouting his name and just fucking sobbing and saying how sorry I am. I don�۪t know what to fucking do I just want my baby boy back so fucking badly I am so sorry Sushi, I love you so much, I want to be with you."
Wish I could cease to exist.,"Here is an in depth article on my personal experience of depression and anxiety and how it came to be - tl;dr - I started with panic attacks due to phobia of vomiting, it escalated to general anxiety and OCD, then had my son which caused post-natal depression on top of the other mental health issues.I feel like recently it is one bad thing after another and I can't seem to pick myself up. I made the decision to hand over primary care of my son to my Mum come January so he could attend nursery and be a little more normal but my friends have expressed great distaste for this and think it best he remains under my care.I have had three mental break downs in as many weeks and considered suicide but have always stopped myself because I can't imagine someone having to explain to my three year old why he would never see me again. This breaks my heart to write but I just want him to be happy and I can't help but feel I will some how mess him up.I just feel like I'm not enough for him. I barely get by and because of my anxiety and depression I don't have great prospects for work. I'd like to work from home but I don't have any talents that stand out or I can afford to work on.
Every time I speak with friends or my Mum it comes across as though I'll somehow be cured and things will go back to normal but I can't see myself ever being normal again. I can't imagine not living in fear of germs.I wasn't ready to be a Mum. I love my little boy but he deserves a good life which I can't see me being able to provide."
Got the note written can't do it,I know I have to do this but I don't know how.  I've put a rope in the tree but I can't bring myself to do it.  I thought I could do it and then faint and be unconscious during the bad part.  I don't know how to do this.  But I've got to.  I wish someone could come give me a shot or an IV or something.  I hate guns.  I need it to be quick and painless
I feel like I will attempt soon,"I haven't exactly ""planned"" anything but I know which method I will use and I have the ability to obtain that method. I have a bad feeling I will just take a gamble soon. Wake up ""Fuck, ok"" Don't wake up... Well I'll probably be too dead to notice and if there is an afterlife then I'll know then. "
Wondering what to do with my last one or two weeks,"I am not looking for help. I know this is a community for those who do, and I've posted before. But this time I've decided for sure. I want to live the last days of my life having fun, but since I'll be dead everything feels kinda pointless. Any suggestions for what to do before I go?"
When you have thoughts about suicide how do you stop them/get rid of them?,I don't so I can't help. I just leave them and in a few weeks/ month I hope they go away
Not a lot of time left.,I'm doing 20 pills and a bottle of cough syrup a day now. Haven't eaten in 4 days. I think tonight will be the night. My liver really hurts. I wanted to look somewhat healthy to walk in the gun shop tomorrow to not give anything away. That was the original plan. Get a gun. Don't really want to do it at moms house though. Too messy. The plan now is to take 30 plus pills and two bottles in the next hour. Probably survive it though. I stopped reaching out to people here because I'm not going to the ward again. All I have is Reddit. You. I don't have a message. I don't curse god. I just don't belong. I don't hate anyone. I love everyone. No where else to go now. One post to you. One prayer to him. It's time.
Gonna kill myself if I'm still alone by the time I finish college,I'm sick and tired of bursting into tears every time I see a couple on tv or in real life.  After I finish college I'm probably never going to meet anyone.  Any attempts to do online dating have all burned into flames and I'm just done.  3 more years and I can finally end this fucking nightmare of a life I was cursed with.
i dont want to die,"i fucked up last night and i want to tell someone, but no one i know because im so ashamedi had gone a few weeks without drinking but i broke my streak last night and drank a bottle of wine
wanted to get drunker so i biked to the grocery store to pick up a handle
i remember thinking ""i don't mind if i get hit"" and ""i shouldn't do this, but whatever""
and im so fucking alarmed with myself nowalthough, i changed my tune a few blocks in, from ""i don't care if i die tonight"" to ""actually i don't want to die, but i do need milk and would like some more booze"" and i rode very carefully and took sidewalks for a lot of it to minimize interactions with cars, so i feel like i might be overreacting. but i've been low-key suicidal for maybe 8 years now, and just ended a three-year relationship a few months ago (and it had been painfully deteriorating for about a year before that) and ive been feeling so fucking lost and hopeless and alone. i work like 60 hours a week so i don't have to think about anything. maybe it's the combo of all that shit, stress and alcohol and loneliness, that let me get that close to it but i really don't want to be that close to it.but i feel more sure than i have in months that i really want to live. i don't want to die. i don't want to get that close. i also don't want to get drunk alone ever again, because it's just stupid, it makes me feel like shit and it's a waste of money and i don't like that it lowered my inhibitions with suicide so much"
I'm running out of energy.,"I've been fighting this urge for so long I just don't know how much more I have in me. I want so badly just to off myself, but I don't want to abandon my family or put that burden on them. So instead I wait here in this empty shell of a person hoping to simply fall over dead from some random, wild disease. But patience is not something I've really ever been good with. I'm at a fork in the road, with the road I've already traveled crumbling behind and nothing but the choice of plummeting into an abyss or scaling an impossible cliff face in front of me. I don't want to make the climb because I know for damn sure I'll slip and fall, but I can't go backwards because the road is crumbling and I'd just wind up back here in the future anyway. I can make the leap into the abyss, but I don't want my loved ones to follow me. Who gets to dictate this stuff? Who gets to decide what I do to myself? Certainly not anyone but myself, yet somehow I feel obligated to stick around for the sake of my family's well being, even though I don't contribute much at all. "
Help me take my mind off this,"I'm currently in the middle of a long journey by train after a distressing thing that happened earlier today. I can't hold back the tears. I want to cry and scream but I can't. I feel helpless and the only thing I can think of is wanting to end the pain that's in my chest and stop the thoughts. And that's the only thing that gives me comfort - the thought that this can all end as soon as I get out of this miserable journey. I don't really have the energy to type out the whole story here, but suffice to say that I'm tired of people I love treating me without any empathy at all. I'm on the way to having a good career, and I'm fairly talented, but I feel that my life is a waste. I smile at people at work all day and pretend that I'm okay. But I cry a lot; I oftentimes take a walk alone and just cry. My own family thinks that whatever distresses me isn't serious, and sometimes say that I'm just messed up on the inside, or if it were that serious I'd have tried to do something drastic already. I see a therapist but I get no real help. I almost want to end my life just to prove them wrong.I want these episodes where I just cry, cry, and cry to just stop. I feel horrible and helpless and it takes a lot for me to convince myself that tomorrow will be a better day.There are a few days when I'm happy, but every night before I go to sleep I always hope that tomorrow is not the day when it all ends again for me. And then I go through days and days of just trying to survive because I have to. The problem is, I want to survive, it's just that people around me seem to try to do everything to prevent this whenever they figure out my vulnerability.My only hope in life is to be happy in the long-term but after many years of struggling, I just want to know why shit always seems to happen.Now that I'm trying not to cry in a public place where people are just trying to peacefully live their lives, I think I've hit a new low that I didn't think was possible, where I shed tears uncontrollably in a public place. I've seen people laugh. I hate myself and I hate that my life has taken this turn.I'm expected at work tomorrow, dressed up, looking good, and my suffering tonight will have been for nothing. My life won't have changed and no one still understands my pain. "
Idk,"Idk how much longer I can do this. Today just feels fucking bad. I just feel so damn numb. The desire to do something stupid is strong as hell and I don't know what to do. I really can't take this shit, I'm barely hanging on. "
Im going to kill myself in a couple of days,"I know this is about to be the end for me. I completely isolated myself over three years ago. I turned my phone off for a year. My son said he doesn't want to come see me anymore and I can find any reason to live. Its not really sad, its just.....is. He has friends and a little brother now and he won't need me. My mom died and I broke off an engagement and lost a job in a months time, and I guess it was too much. People are self serving and predictable, and I just can't do this anymore. I find myself researching ways to do it when Im bored. I settled on a method, Im purchasing all the required equipment now. Its so funny, this is not a rash decision, its not even like a conscience decision, but its something I know I am going to do. Look out for each other in this world.
Im quite fond of my chosen methodology. I bought a Honda portable generator and a two man tent. Im going to go spend a day or two of meditation in Yellowstone, and then place carbon monoxide warnings on the tent at night and run the generator with a half full tank in the tent. That way it will be off and clear of CM in the morning. Im going to die under the stars in Yellowstone."
Still haven't changed my mind.. i dont think so anyway. im done,I don't fucking know what to do. im in the van wirh friends heading back home. all i want to do is get out of the car and leap into traffic.fuck this.. im just done feeling this way. i dont know im trying to reach out. but i feel too far gone. like some kind of lost cause.
I don't want to hurt myself anymore.,"You don't know me. I've posted various times on this subreddit with several throwaways. Thank you all for your support. I have won my battle with depression and gender dysphoria, and I have not contemplated suicide nor cut myself in over a month. As someone who dreamed of dying in my sleep for at least 4 years and cut myself multiple times weekly for almost twice that, this normalcy in my brain feels like euphoria.Thank you again, all of you. All the support you provide does make a difference."
I have no idea why I'm contemplating suicide but I'm still interested.,"I'm living a pretty good life... but I'm pretty drunk and it just feels like an interesting thing to do, you know? It would end it all, make me hopefully just forget all these thoughts i have all the time and cease to be. It also was weird to be in the army. Holding that instrument of death in my hand at all times. I might go grab it from the shelf."
I dont think my parents love me anymore,"I dont feel the love my parents give when i wss a child, my dad used to love me he always took care of me my mon too but when i was 12 things have changed they started having bias to my sister that my sister is more perfect than me now im 13 and it got worst, today, i went in my sister's room and disturbed her but she chased me out and slammed the door after that my dad came out and kick me and took the stool and swing it at my back and used his leg to kick my leg"
I just lost my job at Wendy's,I just got fired from Wendy's after working there for nearly 2 years. I got fired because my pants kept falling and I didn't bother to buy a new belt or tighter pants because I thought it was a non-issue. This is my first time getting fired before. What should I do? I get depressed real easily and I'm contemplating suicide. I need help.
How's everyone's night going? :),Anyone want to chat about anything?
Suicide in every way except for actually killing myself (yet).,"Hey guys,
This is just a vent type of post so sorry if I come across as annoying.As you may be able to tell from the title, I am committing ""suicide"" in every way besides actually doing the deed. I will not actually kill myself yet, as I am still living with my parents. I love them to death. They are the sole reason I have not hung/used an exit bag yet even though I have all of the materials. I'm 17, male, and pathetic. I would tell you guys why but it's kind of complicated and I think I explained it pretty well in my other posts (you could check them out on my profile if you'd like).Basically, I'm purposely sabotaging everything I have. It's a form of self punishment.Physical Sabotage:
I used to workout, but ever since I had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting, I have been eating just enough to survive. I do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism (for example, used to have 34"" standing vertical Jump, but now it is about 24"") by an extreme caloric deficit. I am working on becoming severely underweight, malnourished, and very weak to the point that walking is a chore. Basically imagine a skeleton with hair. I have not been drinking much water either, and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration (again, drinking just enough to stay alive). I never exercise and force myself, for example, to take the elevator instead of stairs. I know I am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities, but I reject them all. I know I'm selfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much I hate myself. I've even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases. This would hopefully cause amputations. I still take showers and brush my teeth because I hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something. Otherwise, my body is a complete mess, rightfully so.Financial Sabotage:
I have a job in lawn care and make about 12.50/hr which is pretty good. For now I am keeping my job for only 2 reasons. Reason 1: I am saving money to ease the financial troubles my family is going through (divorce and both parents have low income). Reason 2: All the money left over I donate because I don't deserve any of it.
I feel better when I have no money in my wallet because I know that's what is right for me.Educational Sabotage:
I am a pretty good student. 4.65 GPA and 32 ACT/12 ACT Writing. That's great and all but this year, senior year, I am purposely trying to tank my grades. I am trying to get all Cs or Ds so I can barely pass. I like to see myself fail tests and assignments. Even if I know the answers I still choose the wrong ones. My grades and ACT are from freshman-junior year, when I used to be ambitious and attempting to get into University of Pennsylvania. That dream is gone. I do not want to be successful. It's not worth anything. So, since I have an ""all or nothing"" mindset, I am choosing ""nothing.""Relationship Sabotage:
This one is probably the least effective on me. I don't have many friends but the ones that I do have, I am breaking ties with. I do things to make them think that I'm a very mean and selfish person. I sometimes talk back to my teachers to make them think lowly of me as well.  I still try to do the best for my parents by taking care of them and faking happiness so they can be happy (I don't know if it's working, I don't care). They have done so much for me, I want to return the favor even if it's not sincere.So this is it guys. I'm methodically ruining my life so suicide isn't that extreme when the time comes. I'll wait it out until I am as distant as I've ever been to my parents (read: halfway across the world with minimal contact) in order to end it. Now is not the right time. I just wanted to thank you guys so much for reading this far, if you have. It means a lot to me. Usually I write better but I have a time limit and I'm typing on the road at each stoplight. So there are many breaks in my writing. I will see you guys tomorrow. No suicide here, just eternal suffering :)."
What's the point,"I've hit that wall. Made some dumb drug/drink mistakes which led to bad choices. I'm withdrawing from alcohol and it feels awful. I can't bring myself to tidy my room; it's disgusting. I mean, actually embarrassing not just messy. I've let myself go. These last few months have been awful. I don't know where to start. I need to lose weight, I miss my anorexia. It was like a friend. My body hurts from constant laxative ODs and right now, I just need to ramble and write. I'm sorry it's all about me; I don't think I'm meant to be alive. If an animal was violent, ill or just not functioning it would be humane to put it down so why not me. "
Ffff,Id fucking kill myself right now if i hade a private place to do it ohmygod i hate myself so much and i wanna die so bad
Its not that big of a deal,"I'm considering suicide because I am an absolute failure at life, failed academically, failed socially, failed everything. There's nothing in my life worth salvaging. I think about my family a lot, what it would put them through, and that blocks me from doing it, committing to it. But what harm is it to them really? They will be depressed for a little while and then get over it. My mother is the one I'm worried about the most, she is very weak mentally and wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time she has religion, and I think that'd give her strength. I hope so at least. I've considered writing in my suicide note that I asked for forgiveness for what I'm about to do, and I'm not a religious person, but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it, then I'd definitely do it. My brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but I see them getting through it, they are strong. My dad would be angry at me and rightfully so, but I don't think he'd have a hard time getting over it. I've thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that, but the way I see it, it's better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead, and I know that those people are out there experiencing those things, so its not so bad. Someone gets to do it, it just won't be me. I have a noose made and a place I want to go to do it, but I don't think its long enough and I'm afraid I'll botch it. There's also a shotgun in the house that I can use, but it'll be really hard to get access to it, since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempt. I'm terrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing, but it's entirely my own fault. I'm entirely to blame. I want them to blame me but not hate me. And I guess thats all I can do."
DIY how to survive?,"I have wanted to kill myself for as long as I can remember, since I was a kid. I'm 26 now and don't know how to deal with it. I have hurt myself in different ways many times over the years, but haven't made a full out, serious attempt to kill myself. Because no matter how much I want to, no matter how much I hate being myself, I could not do that to my family. I have an amazing family, and I know that I am so privileged to say that. They know that I have been depressed and support me when I told them that I'm taking antidepressants. The treatment helps a lot, but even after several months of increased medication I still think about how much I want to kill myself every day. I don't know how to deal with it. It's a bizarre feeling because I know how I want myself to be and it's really not hard, it's just beyond my grasp, and I can't make myself be that person no matter how hard I've tried. I don't want to try anymore. I know I won't try to really kill myself because I truly do love my family that much. But I'm not sure how to handle these feelings. I have already been seeing my doctor, and she's a great doctor and knows everything. I have told a few close friends about how bad it is, and they're very supportive of helping me get better. But I don't know what to do next, I just don't want to exist and I wish that there was a way that my loved ones would support it. Like when you have assisted suicide from a doctor and everyone is okay with it because they know how you are suffering, and there's no chance of recovery. I have been trying SO HARD to recover for so long, I don't want to do it anymore. "
There is no way i am surviving this school year,"Im going to kill myself before june of 2018. I dont know when but i know it will be before then. I cant take school its 7 hours 5 days a week plus hw. I dont like most of my ""friends"". I will probably just end up with a shit 9 to 5 that i hate so i feel better off dead soon. Im losing a lot of my time to bullshit that i hate.     "
Tell me suicide isn't the answer.,"You can't. Plain and simple. Life is worthless. We all die, every single one of us. What's the point of prolonging the inevitable? What the hell does it matter if I die now or 50 years from now? Some of you might say, ""what about how your loved ones would feel if you killed yourself""? Well I'll tell you this. Nobody really cares about anybody else but themselves. This isn't coming from a place of angst but of truth. Human beings only understand the self. It's all we know as long as we aren't 100% certain that the self is all that exists. Put simply, my parents would only be upset because of how they would feel, not because of any arbitrary love for me. Even more simply, love is not real, it is only a chemical reaction in our brains. On top of this, every single thing we do in life is just to get a rush of dopamine. There is literally nothing else. Some of you will throw some ""feel good"" bullshit at me. Go ahead. Try and convince me life is worth living."
At the end of my endurance,"I am a 24 yr old m. I am severely depressed.I can't get over how horrible this world is, I hate it and most of the disgusting people in it. I think people are awful and most of them are only out for themselves, crushing everyone else in their wake.I am offered nothing except for religious ""condolences"" from my parents, who are the only ones I talk to any more. It makes me fucking SICK. There is nothing more infuriating than being told everything will be alright by RELIGIOUS people. FUCK off. I don't give a shit where people spend their eternity if it exists. When people are cancerous to others around them they should be excised just like a tumor; and the LAST thing I want to hear is that ""they'll get theirs"". That is such a cop out I can't even begin.I can't cope any more. I don't have anything left. I want to kill myself. I don't think there's anything left on this speck of dust for me. I've always been an outcast. I've never been liked. But I never hurt anybody, I just keep to myself. I don't know why everyone doesn't like me. I just don't want to be in pain anymore.Does it get better? Or does it just keep getting worse? I know I'm not old enough to know properly, perhaps. Life hurts."
Hate myself,"I've had depression for 4 years. I've tried almost everything I can to cure myself but everything in my life has gone wrong.
I've waited and waited and waited for some miracle or change of cicumstances to occur that will put an end to all the pain but I've finally accepted that I'm doomed to live a life of constant suffering and torment. Is that a life really worth living?
At this point I think the only winning move is not to play "
18/M overdosed few days ago 'miraculously survived ' going to try again very soon.,"I need help , but it seems everyone who I've asked although empathetic has no idea of how I feel or why I want to die . I suffer from these severe highs and lows with my mood fluctuating from extremely happy,confident and outgoing to 1 second later wanting to kill myslef . I'm just done, life isn't worth living if it's like this and I't seems no one understand what I'm going through . The next time I feel so low I'm going to do it and I'll finally be set free. "
To whoever this may concern,"I'm ending my life.
I wrote  a detailed letter in here and then the battery on my phone died and now the entire long story is gone.I will just make this short.
I stood by a woman who promised me loyalty and a better life and what I got is that she cheated and abandoned me W/O car food or money and refused to take me to get pills I need and LIED over & over about taking me to the surgery I needed.   She cheated on me and tried everything to cause me to die. Getting in the way if medical needs and causing me to starve literally!!!!
      She refused to buy me food.
I was just abandoned while she is making over 7500 monthly income AFTER TAXES besides bonus. She got a job as a director in a medical field. She got that job  because I LIED FOR HER by giving her a great review as a past employer, I was never her employer. She tried to kill me by stealing my cardiac pills.
  She cheated on me started on Thanksgiving  with a subordinate asshole from that job.  She now has TWO INCOMES AND TWO CARS and I have nothing!!     She preaches ""patient care"" to rge employees but literally caused situations over and over so I would die. She actually tried to kill me in ways that would show as medical problems. I'm now in horrible living conditions!!   Toilet leaks snf rbe place smells like a sewer and I have no decision ability since I can't work.  She knew I can't work and told me after my open heart surgery that  I will never work again abf that she will take care of everything.I'm miserable and tired of living. I have NO ONE to even write a goodbye letter to. I'm homeless and hopeless. I had a long detailed letter all typed out until the phone battery died and all the text was gone.I want to die without anger.
I want to just cry but I can't even even do THAT.  I don't want to be in this world. I don't belong here."
Self harm,"I don�۪t do it often, usually if I�۪m drunk and feel alone and isolated. But I don�۪t consider myself suicidal at the moment. I think I have seasonal depression and it�۪s coming back, but does anyone else self harm when they�۪re drunk? I can be hanging out with friends all night but the moment I�۪m alone it happens. I guess I�۪m just looking for an excuse to do it? I don�۪t really know. I kind of see the pain as a reality check if that makes sense. It�۪s a reminder to myself that no matter how happy i feel at the moment, it�۪s watching and waiting. Sorry for the weird post, I just needed to say it. "
What am I supposed to do when I'm literally incapable of anything?,"Like seriously what is the point of living a shit youth suffering mental disorders, physical defects & massive failures just so that I can live a happy old life? I don't see the point of all this. The only reason I'm holding on rn is for the sake of my amazing parents. They have done so much for me it'd destroy them completely if I ended my pathetic existence.
This is so fucked up. I can't live and I can't die too! "
I don't want to starve to death.,"I haven't eaten in over a week. Ive had three offers of help. The first went no where due to the gift card not working in Canada. The second deleted his account. The third sent me funds, I placed an order through skipthedishes and they crashed. Restaurant calling me asking where the driver is and I has to explain their failure. If there is a God he fucking hates me. I don't want to keep going when this shit fails over and over again"
I wish there was a stickied thread,"Some days I just need to spill the filth in my brain so it'll stop poisoning me. I don't want responses, especially pleading, ESPECIALLY condescension. I just need to purge it. Starting a thread is so conspicuous. "
Need help for a friend,"Friend messaged me, he has little real friends and gets bullied a bit. He said he was just tired of life and so he got into some weird drugs. He told me he's just tired of life and all the shit he puts up with and just doesn't care anymore. I honestly don't know what to respond; I told him he has a lot to live for but this is a sensitive topic and don't want to go about it wrong. He said he came home from work, some douches at work said some things (idk what they did, but this guy gets bullied quite a bit and has lots of girl troubles). Last thing he told me was that he hated life and that he tried some drugs (not like him). What should I say?"
I deserve it.,"This past year has been rough. I made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them, one after another, for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought I was making everyone else depressed. Ever since then, that person has been stalking me. Another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship, because I was ""being too nice"" to other people, and he thought it was fake of me. I've lost other friends, countless friends, throughout the years, and these aren't the ones that have hurt the most, but they're more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault. So I've been thinking I must deserve it. I got up today thinking about ending my life, and that's all I've been able to think about, all day long. My family would get over it. My friends would find new friends, if they haven't already. The people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie. Everyone can just go on without me and it'll be fine. The only thing stopping me right now is cowardice, but I'm seriously afraid that will eventually run out. "
"I'm a monster, I don't deserve to live.","I've tried to put what I'm feeling into words but I can't accurately describe what I'm feeling. It's almost 4 AM here, I'm not a native speaker and my mind is muddled by quetiapine but I need to get this ugly thing out of my chest.
Basically, I've been diagnosed with traits of BPD/HPD (not fully developed PDs), I display certain behaviours associated with those personality disorders and I feel like I'm a bad person that deserves to die. I want to gouge my eyes out, tear my body apart and run away from myself. I've been in therapy ever since I was 14 and I've still turned out fucked up, there are tiny improvements but overall, I feel I will never become a person that is worthy of having a happy life and being loved. I mean, all these years of therapy and no significant improvement?
I have a volatile relationship with my parents, especially my mother, I'm a bad daughter and often I think it'd be better for them if I died or killed myself. I  to kill myself if I can't be a good daughter, a good person. I don't even  like a person, I don't feel like a human being and I haven't for a long time, I feel like it's not solid, material things building my body but my self-hate and fear and anger and envy. I'm not even sure I can love, maybe all I can feel when I 'love' is an egocentric, messed up, child-like dependency, maybe that's all I'm capable of. If that's the case, I absolutely do not deserve to have a family that loves me, I don't deserve a life.
I genuinely don't want to die, I don't want to not-exist, it's a scary thought, but I want to and deserve to kill myself. I don't know how to help myself and transform my personality and maladaptive behaviours into something healthy and good and pure. I honestly don't feel like there's an ounce of goodness in me, I'm just a bad person trying but failing to be good. There's not a single fucking redeeming quality about me, except maybe the fact I'm trying to be better but I'm not sure about that because I can't tell if it's not just ego-driven.
Tbh, I don't even feel I deserve to get better.  I promised myself I wouldn't be dramatic in this post but turns out I'm stuck in my teenage emo phase. Also, I know I'm histrionic but I'm not exaggerating for attention, scout's honour. I just needed to tell someone and I don't feel it's okay to burden my friends with this and I'm ashamed of myself. And I can't text my therapist at 4 AM.tl;dr I want to kill myself both as a punishment and because I can't live with myself. Please someone buy me tickets for a flight to destination Not Me, TIA. I'm exhausted, I need a vacation."
Guys do you know some ways to get cancer,this.
I feel pathetic and lost.,"Hi, I'm new to reddit and sorry if I'm doing something wrong here(please let me know).
   My life is so pathetic and I honestly wish sometimes I don't know why I exist. Since grade school, I was always the almost non-existent friend that somehow gets bullied when I hit the spotlight (for whatever reason). I've left school twice, to get home schooled and medical treatment/therapy. Ever since, I've always had a desire to be liked and ""known"" because of this. Whenever I see people I know having fun, being surrounded by many people, and exist in other's lives, I get extremely jealous. I honestly feel pathetic that I even get jealous because I don't even deserve to be jealous.
   Prior to transferring to my current uni, I was excited to start brand new and be part of the fun at such a prestigious university. Now I'm a senior and I'm still alone, with subpar GPA. I regret everything I've done this past year because I haven't done any impressive EC's, low GPA, and obviously no friends. I feel so pathetic that I couldn't achieve a high GPA when I had no social life to begin with. I'm aiming for grad school (PHD), but at this rate it's probably impossible because of my below 3.5 GPA. I constantly think about professors and grad students probably mocking me how I perform in class. I'm afraid of peers probably looking down on me. I'm constantly overwhelmed with fear when I'm at school.
   I was actually blessed to have a friend for a few months, but one day I was shut down by the friend because I was ""pathetic, weak-willed, egocentric, good for nothing"". This happened when I reached out to the friend when I was suffering with depression and anxiety. After that it has scarred me tremendously and I've became afraid to be friends or open up to anyone. Now I spend everyday alone. I've lost touch with all my friends from back home after moving.
   I can't stop thinking about how my grades are poor, the loneliness, and my self-worth. I honestly feel like I have no talent in anything and it makes me wonder what purpose I serve in this world. I really feel like a good for nothing, just like the friend said. I don't have (or ever had) anyone who would even care about me. I can't stop thinking about ending everything. Probably the only thing I would miss (holding me back) is my parents and boyfriend that I semi-trust. But I can't seem to have enough energy to continue and care about them. I probably am egocentric, because I pretty much can only care about how I feel and what I want. I can only seem to care about the happiness that will come out of suicide.
I just really want to disappear.."
I don't know,"Why I'm making this. I guess it's a last ditch. I'm very near killing my self. I've struggled with a gun to my head countless times. Never having pulled the trigger. My fianc̩ aborted our boy without telling me and then left me. I'm absolutely dead inside. The only thing I feel at all is morbid depression. She was my life, we were starting a family. I loved her more than life in every sense of the term. I miss her a disgustingly. My world. The other morning I woke up in the hospital with no one around confused as to where I was and how I got there until I looked on a tray besides me and saw my empty bottle of adavan and pain killers, looked in my phone and saw some pretty cold texts between the two of us. Pieced it tougher. I went on suicide autopilot and swallowed enough prescription drugs to kill a horse. I don't know how it didn't work. It made me sick. I gathered my shit from the room and left without saying anything to anyone. These last few days have been getting worse, and I don't think there's anything left for me. I love her so damn much. And she killed our baby without even telling me. I want to die. I don't see any way around it. I know people have been through worse than this, but I'm just not strong enough. I know I'll hurt people but I want this disgusting pain to be over. "
i want to end it,"ok, a little bit of background information. im 17 years old and in college. im advanced academically with a decent job with a management position at my college newspaper. my mom loves and supports me, my sister is my best friend, my dad isnt always the best but he's trying. what im trying to say is i have everything going for me...
and yet i still want to die. ive been depressed for as long as i can remember (first self harmed at 12 years old). i used to take thumbtacks and stab them into my arms because it wouldnt scar like cutting. now i burn myself with my hair straightener.maybe i made this reddit account and this post as a cry for help? or a desperate attempt at attention? or for someone to tell me itll all be okay? i dont know what im doing. all i want is to die. i cant handle being alive anymore. it all hurts too much. i just need a hug."
Is it bad I�۪m testing my friends just waiting to see who opens there mouth first.,"First let me start off by saying I truly do wish to be dead( in my opinion  it be better for everyone if I�۪m not here ) ok now I can get to it.So...Is it bad that I am telling all the people that truly matter to me in this godforsaken world that I want to die and then describing in detail about how, why, and even when and the telling them not to say a word to anyone. By this they feel bound by friendship pulling them in both direction. Ether toward me and what I told them to do or telling someone else. I�۪ve told about 5 people in this world about my secret about wanting to die over about a 4 month. I don�۪t think anyone believes me which is fine because i decide a long time ago how things were going to play out. (Ps. This is a very important date to me 1/12/2018 happens to be coming up very fast )"
Done with everything,"I'm 17, male. I've been contemplating suicide after failing 11th grade. I've been depressed for the last three years but I've only recently started taking meds for it. My coping mechanism used to be to watch my favorite youtubers and slip out of everything, but as i write this, my phone is smashed to shit because I've just lost it and thrown it at a wall in a fit of anger. I feel like a freak who's been putting up a clean front for too long. None of my friends know about me and any of this. I just want this to end and I just want to stop being such a disappointment to my family, especially my parents, who work their asses off to give me what I have. "
It's getting harder to wake up.,"Being awake is a nightmare. Half the time I am numb, the other half I am in such severe depression I feel like I'm drowning.
I am genuinely considering trying to get a physician to allow me to end my life.
I just want my agony to end. I don't want to be living and feeling such anguish and sadness anymore....
I've attempted suicide before by ODing, by slitting.......
Why am I feeling such unholy pain?
I almost want my parents to just ALLOW me to end it. To understand this is what is meant. That I NEED to end my life..... That I'm not going to get better......."
Developing schizophrenia,"I am losing reality every day that goes by. I hear voices daily. They're not next to me. They're not whispering in my ear. They are always outside of my room door, in the kitchen, in the vents. I've seen a screaming face come out of my poster in my room. I have seen an arm reach toward me coming from out of my curtain. I have extreme paranoia. I can not trust anymore. I do not trust my girlfriend even though she says she promises to not do things that will hurt me. All of her friends hate me. Apparently my paranoia makes me a horrible person. My paranoia is completely justified to me. I am absolutely right. The entire world says I'm wrong.The only thing I am able to do that makes me feel better is remembering the thought of judgment day coming. Anyone who has hurt me and brought evil to the world without an inquiry of forgiveness or guilt will be dealt with and all of the pain and suffering will be brought to an equilibrium by justice. May God accept my never ending plea for forgiveness and may He protect me from all evil including whatever my NEVER STOPPING THOUGHTS ARE.I will not suicide, it's a sin. but wow how beautiful the thought is to leave this worldly life. There's too much suffering for me to handle."
My Parents Don't Seem to Understand,"They don't seem to understand that if you yell at your child for ""using depression as an excuse for everything"", call them a ""lazy piece of shit"", or say ""she says she has depression but won't say why she's depressed, it's disgusting"".... that just makes me not want to tell them I want to kill myself as well. So much for having ""loving and supporting parents"""
I'm close and it scares me,I recently started college and quickly made some friends. They were nice but when feelings of depression/suicide returned I pushed them away so nobody at my school would care when I die. I'll just b that kid that not many people knew that killed him self during 1st semester. Without friends all I think about is suicide. I took a run through the woods today to scout out trees that could handle my weight when I hang myself. I hate myself. I'm a burden on other people and they're better off without me. I'm just a pussy that needs to go die.
I'm not good,i don't really have problems with confidence in myself or with talking to people i just often decide what i have to say isn't worth wasting people's time with though i guess maybe that is a problem with confidence i dunno i feel confident i just feel like I'm a waste of chemicals and i want to die.
I�۪m writing my letter and the date is set.,"I have 13 days to make peace with everyone and then it will all be over. My plan is foolproof. Now I just have to make sure my letter is perfect. Please don�۪t feel the need to be nice or reassure me, that�۪s not what I�۪m looking for. I just needed to tell someone. "

i just want to die,thats it i just want to take too many pills and die i hate life
What reasons do you keep living for?,"Just wondering what things encourage any of you here to keep living, whether it's friends, vacations, music, etc. Kinda need something to look forward to right now."
I've tied a noose. It's getting harder and harder resisting the urge to hang it up and get it over with.,"Everyday hurts, and I just don't want to be alive anymore. There's no point to it. I can picture things getting better all I want, but at the end of the day, what's it matter if ""things get better""? I'm only prolonging what will inevitably happen anyway. What if I just don't want to live. I don't want to ""try"" anymore. I don't  if it's possible that things will change. I just want life to be over . I can't do this anymore, I just can't stand waking up, breathing, living. I don't want it. I can't do this. I just need the courage to go through with it. That's all that's holding me back, not some ""you don't really want to die"" bs. I'm just a coward. But I think hanging myself would be the best choice. I just have to kick the chair from under me, then there's no turning back, no matter how scared I get. And I can do that. I can do that. That'd be the only thing I could do. I'm just so tired. I have no one to talk to, no one who would care, and being constantly isolated was bound to take its tole anyway. My death wouldn't be a surprise to anyone and no one would notice if I were gone--or well, my parents might notice, since those are the only people that I see everyday. But I'm such a burden, that it would probably make their lives easier. I just want everything to stop. I've been taking sleeping pills randomly because I can't stand being conscious. And I just want to sleep permanently. Sorry for rambling.I'm just here to vent a little, so someone could know I was here, if only for a little while. "
"I have no idea how to help this dude. I don't want him to end his life, please help him","I'm terrible at expressing my ideas and at writing in general. If someone who is better at persuading someone not to end their lives  could help this dude, that would be the best."
Still alive,"I tried to kill myself like 10 days ago. Now ive been released from the hospital, and im alone again in my house. My parents avoid me now, thats the only thing that really changed. And i got a dyagnosis: Avoidant personality disorder. I hate the ""survivor"" and the ""now begin a new life"" stuff, but that dyagnosis is actually helpful. Years of therapy and i needed to almost bleed to death for someone to tell me what the fuck is wrong with me. They never mentioned that im very ugly but thats ok. I already knew that it makes socializing even harder.Next time i will follow the main plan and just jump from my rooftop. I dont know why i thought at the last moment that cutting my wrists would be a decent substitute. Well, i know why: there was a lot of people calling the police when they saw me sitting on the edge of the void about to do it. Anyway, i should have done it. And... suiciding and then waking up is a feeling beyond any descriptio, so i dont think i want to experience that again. I think it affected me in ways i dont want and will not understand....They took my phone during those days, im sorry if i worried someone here. I feel so lonely. Its completely overwhelming. But i really felt some human feeling like ""someone cares about me"" or something like that when i loged in today and discovered so many private messages still asking if i was ok. Thank you all. Really. Thank you. I dont know what will happen to me now. I dont know why im writing this. But thanks for reading. And sorry about confusing writing and bad english.(Does anybody know why cant i post on ?)"
It's me once again,hey it's me again back to where i started i feel like if i keep going i'm going to end up hurting someone because of the fact everyone treats me like i'm nothing and how they insult me to prevent any pain i would cause people i'm going to kill myself
First suicidal thought in seven months,"Hello! Last year I suffered a concussion that gave me some awful symptoms including brain fog, memory loss, decline in social skills, extremely uncomfortable feelings in the back of my head and more. It was too much to cope with, especially after 4 months of going to doctors and not getting any diagnosis. I decided killing myself was the only way to escape my seemingly eternal condition. I set a date in May and started planning. Around February, I started feeling a little less bad and the doctors also prescribed me some medicine and exercises to get me on the right track, so I stopped feeling suicidal.At some point during the first four months when I was still trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with me, I visited an ENT and he prescribed me nose spray (which ended up having nothing to do with the problem) I started noticing some weird feelings in my nose and ear after taking it for a couple weeks so I stopped. The nose feeling never really went away though. Fast forward about 6 months, and I was almost fully healed from the concussion symptoms. All of the sudden, the nose symptom got a lot worse. My entire left nostril felt like the contents had been sucked out of it with a vacuum and now the flow of air is way too strong. All of the air flowing in makes both my throat dry and soar all the time, and creates this irritating scrapey feeling above my left ear. On top of that, it seems like some of the brain fog symptoms I was describing earlier have returned along with this thing and I feel like my entire head is a mess again.I'm currently visiting some doctors to see if they can provide any insight, but dealing with it for a month and only seeing it get worse is really demoralizing. I feel depressed and anxious constantly and kinda feel like I wanna die again. Idk how long I'm gonna be able to hold on this time if my body keeps bombarding me with all of these symptoms.Just really needed to vent somewhere, thanks for reading"
Nothing is getting better.,"Everything I try and do just blows up in my face, my friends are leaving me, life is pathetic and pointless. All I ever wanna do now is smoke weed constantly to get through and half enjoy the day. My life is going nowhere man God I hate it here "
Trying to take the emotion out of it,"I gave been miserable for awhile now. I don't know why, but I can't remember the last time I was actually happy. Despite this, I am trying to look at my life logically while removing the emotions from the equation. I don't see a path to me being happy. I am not that interested in my job. It pays well, but I don't really enjoy it. To be honest, I have never had an answer to the question, ""What do you want to do when you grow up?"" I'm 33 now and I still don't have an answer. I don't hate my job, but it is just something I do to pay bills. The only good thing about my job was this one person I work with. Long story short, I caught feelings for her, but she had a boyfriend. We became really good friends and she is single now, but I am too much of a coward to make a move. Plus, I want her to be happy and I don't think I could make her or anyone happy. The hobbies I used to have don't interest me anymore either. I used to spend hours and hours playing video games with my brother and friends, but about a year ago I completely lost interest in them. I try to play them now and I just get bored. I also used to be a huge sports fan. I would watch football and basketball and pay attention to all the news in the offseason. Now, I could care less. I am in a fantasy football league and don't even know what players are on which team anymore. I have lost interest in life and am just miserable on most days. I recently moved away from my friends and family to try to put some distance between us. I want them to get used to the idea of not having me around. I would like to be around to see my nephews and niece grow up, but when I really think about it, they will be better off without me. I don't want them looking up to me in anyway and wanting to be like me.My plan is to get through this holiday season and then I will probably end I all sometime early next year. There are some people at work I want to set up to get promoted that really deserve it in the next couple of months. I am also going to be really stingy with my money so I can leave some for my family. I plan on buying a one way ticket to a country in Europe and ending my life over there. I will ditch all my IDs and then kill myself. My hope is that my body won't be identified and my family can always have hope that I'm still alive. I don't even really know why I am writing this. I guess I am just venting. I don't see my life getting any better and I don't have any motivation to go on the way things are. I am trying to be logical about this. Please let me know if there is any fault in my thing."
Want to die,Life isn't worth living dropped out of college due to anxiety stuck at the same job for years nothing is getting better just someone convince me to just fucking end this because I'm too much of a bitch to just do it myself
Just tried killing myself. Feeling even worse,"First off, I have social anxiety and depression. I've never really been very confident around people (or by myself for that matter) so doing things that seem basic and trivial to most people is always very challenging. I've had depression for just over a decade, seen several therapists and even tried helping myself by trying to be more active and outgoing but ultimately I'll just end up repeating a cycle of being happy for a while and then horribly sad as I start to doubt whether i can truly stay happy. That these people around me don't really care about what happens to me. That they're not really hanging out with me because they want to but out of pity. That my moods are ruining everyone else's vibe. That whether a small mistake i made still gets talked about behind my back. That i have no value as a friend or lover or person. That when i try to commit suicide i can't even do that because i'm too much of a coward and just feel like dead weight. I'm so lonely and scared. I can't trust people because of a rough childhood growing up in a bad neighbourhood and mostly experiencing betrayal and verbal abuse and its killing me inside. I made this throwaway so that maybe at least someone could see this. I really don't know what to do anymore"
Titanic,So E! Has been doing a marathon of movies lately and one of them is Titanic. Does anyone else find Rose's suicidal tendencies incredibly romantic and enticing? Her life is perfect but she can't keep herself off the edge. I found it highly relatable.
Anybody else feel this way?,"My thoughts have been possessed by suicide ideation. Whenever I mention this, people say i have so much to experience (i am only 14.) But I don't want to not be suicidal (until I ultimately find get a gun and kill myself impulsively) for i believe that happy people are delusional filth. Suicidal thoughts are enlightenment and it is ignorant to try and get rid of them. Only reason i haven't killed myself through a non-impulsive way is because i.want to read ""On Suicide:A Discourse on Voluntary Death"" to improve my note quality. Sadly, my parents refuse to let me buy it. Does anyone agree with my sentiments or am i just ""crazy""?"
Honestly don't know how to cope with life anymore.,"I honestly never thought I'd be typing on this subreddit. The fact that I am, makes me feel even worse. I feel guilty because part of me loathes self-pity, but I am scared that one of these days, I might actually do something really dumb. That's why I'm here. This is my first post on this site. I literally made an account so I could talk to someone. To give a little bit of a backstory, because I didn't just wake up like this, will probably be helpful. I have a history with depression and anxiety. I have a history with abuse. Self-abuse/ self harm, abuse from others I've been romantically involved with, and sexual abuse from my childhood. Now on paper, or online, that all seems really dark, and it is, but it doesn't encompass who I am, and looking at me, you'd never be able to tell. I'm an above average attractive 24 year old woman. I have very strong metaphysical beliefs and I honestly believe in the good of mankind. I'm intelligent, I've had to fight to get where I am mentally and emotionally, to come off as really stable. I moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with $400 in my pocket and I made a life for myself here. I finally started living a life that I thought I deserved. A month ago, a girl I've been friends with said to me ""I honestly don't how you're so stable!"" and inside I chuckled to myself because she, like everyone else, only sees the surface. I'm what you'd call a ""functioning depressive"". To put things in perspective, if any of you have ever taken a meyers-briggs personality test, I'm an ENFP. Robin Williams was an ENFP. My number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because I never want to make anyone sad. I hate asking for help. I hate telling people I'm sad to guilt them into wanting to be around me. I know it's very self-destructive. I'm a very self-aware person. I was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because I barely felt like I could keep my head above water. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder. I scored very high on a dissociation test - I would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what I was doing two minutes later. I've almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well. It makes me seem very space-y and ditzy at times, when really I just go somewhere in my head without my permission because it's how I learned to cope with trauma as a child. My best friend tried to kill herself last December as well. She's my roommate, and I found her in the bathtub full of blood, and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before. December of '16 was my bottom. So, I started medication. To be honest, it really fucking helped. It got me out of my head enough to focus on my job. I got back together with someone who I was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability, and things were going great. I felt like November / December 2016 was my ""bottom"" - and I fought my way out and got to a stable place. Then May '17 happened. I started to wean back on my medication because I didn't feel like myself anymore. I was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood, and deal with that, but I didn't feel any emotions. I couldn't cry anymore. I would be in a room full of people, having an amazing time, and pretending I felt something. So I started to correctly wean off of my meds. I had been on them for less than a year, and I read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh side-effects. About a month after I completely quit, I felt back to ""me"" - without the up's and down's. I could paint again (I paint quite frequently, and the medication made me not want to do that anymore), I could cry, and most importantly I could feel things. But it got worse. I couldn't control my emotions anymore in a responsible way. I would lash out at the people I cared about. About what? I mean, 50% of it may have been legitimate things. Part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life OR people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are. 50% of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface. So I ruined a relationship with that guy. He won't speak to me anymore, which is fine, I don't think we were meant to be romantically anyways - but I apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything. I felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that I did. I have always tried to escape these issues through relationships. I have attachment issues. My love language is ""quality time"", so I tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a person I'm romantically involved with, with wanting to spend time with them, like all the time. Part of this is just how I bond, part of this is also escaping myself. I have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months. I don't know if he emphathetically understands these issues. Not that it's his responsibility to fully grasp them, but in this situation, I've tried to be very self-aware so I don't do those things (like lash out, etc). This person has been of great support to me. He has helped pull me out of neutral. I have started to find purpose in myself again, and a reason for being here. Today, I lashed out at him for something very trivial. We are not officially dating because we're millenials and it's only been a couple months, but I love his family, they love me, I love his dog, we spend a majority of our free time together, and I find that we really compliment each other in so many ways. I truly adore him. Of course there is a catch. When I met this person - he told me that he might be going to Europe for an extended period of time in the fall. So that's part of the reason we  to keep it casual, but it just ended up getting more serious, and eventually his ""me"" statements became ""we"" statements. I sometimes feel with this person I am on a rollercoaster. Once we started to get more serious, he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions. I respected that, but with all of my relationship insecurities, I saw it as a big red flag that he's just going to dip out come time. He's reassured me that he could never rid me of his life... but maybe that isn't good enough. I'm looking for something to give me purpose so I don't kill myself one day. I'm looking for it in the wrong places, and the wrong people, and I'm aware of that... but old habits die really hard. It's like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes, and from the theater you're yelling ""stop doing that!"" but they just keep doing it. Over and over again. Part of me thinks I should cut things off to save him from me. To save myself the inevitable heart break I will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for Europe without me. Part of me knows I lash out because yeah, I am insecure as f*** about where the relationship is going, but also because I have deep seated emotional fears. I fear that I will be forgotten. I fear that I will drive everyone away from me. I fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel, my destructive patterns will not let me see it, because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery. It has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind. Believe me when I say, if you met me, you'd think I was the queen of positivity. I want everyone to experience love and to feel loved. For some reason I won't allow that for myself and it kills me. Suicide at this point, albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons, seems less and less terrifying each and every day. The first time the thought crossed my mind, I was freaked out. Now, it's where my mind jumps to. The peace that I would feel, even for a millisecond, of not having to upset anyone anymore. I have a very loving and supportive family, but they don't know any of this. My best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in December, and I feel like if I bring anything up it's going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse. I bottle all of this up. I even asked the guy that I'm seeing to see him because I felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts... but he said that he thinks it's best if we both have space tonight because of how I lashed out at him earlier. So now I'm embarrassed. I feel guilty for even bringing that up to him. I feel like he doesn't care. Does anyone? I guess what I'm looking for is for a reason not to do it, eventually. I'm open to... anything really. I wouldn't be here posting this if I didn't feel so low. Maybe someone can also direct me to a sub-reddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma. I internalize everything. Everything ends up being my fault, even when it isn't, and it's a vicious cycle. I'm just hoping that before I choose to like, literally end my life, I keep going on the off chance that something good will happen. How I'm not seeing that, I don't get it. But, I just don't at the moment. "
It's just been so long,"I'm so tired of dealing with this
With mental illness and insecurities and anxiety attacks
I just want to make it stop already"
No purpose/no meaning in life,"I just turned 15 this September, even though I live the greatest life I beleive a kid can ask for along with siblings and great parents I can't find a reason to live. There's no person I want to live for, no goal I want to achieve and I can't help but feel this life I'm living is meaningless. I can't help but be fascinated with what happens after death in the hopes it's better than this. I'm currently looking into the most pain free way, even though I've been given depression pills and all sorts of gimmicks no matter what I feel the same."
Ive wanted to kill myself every day for 7 years. Every single day. But I'm a coward. This is my balance.,You're not a coward for wanting to live. Use that inner strength to better yourself as a person
Told Everyone I Want to Die; Still Want to Die,"It just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom. Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks. A few days later, during an anxiety attack, a friend messaged me and I impulsively told her that I've been suicidal for the past year and that I was having a mental breakdown. And now I'm telling you, internet stranger.I'm not sure what I expected to get out of telling people. I guess I was looking for some reason to live to just hit me, but it hasn't. Now I just feel more trapped than ever. If I kill myself now, I'm going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt. My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything. All that remains is an obligation to others. That's all I have left. "
I wanna kill myself so desperately,"I am absolutely tired of this loneliness, this lack of human connection and compassion, the fact that I am unlikable and can't talk to people. I don't see any future for me, I don't see how I can survive the adult world, as I am not a competitive person and my social skills are down the drain. I can't do anything right. Success and love (of any type) just seem like they weren't meant for me. I wanna die sooo bad but I don't wanna hurt my family. I am waiting till the latter half of my 20's to commit suicide (I am 20) so maybe I can give life a chance, but I can't wait till then. For now I'll just hope something kills me. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I am sooo 110% fucking done. "
I've planned it,I have everything from the method to the date. Now I just need to isolate myself or ruin every good relationship I have left. I'm done
Looks like I'm doing it,"Just finished writing my goodbye-notes. After two failed attempts,I think I am well prepared this time. 2 days to go
To be honest,I have no idea why I am posting this.There doesn't seem to be anything that could potentially stop me at this point.Medication doesn't help even after the psychiatrist upped the dosage.It never did help.Besides,everything just gets worse.
At first,I tried to get rid of,or,at least,supress the thought of killing myself.
After my first attempt,don't care.I have now,however,accepted and even embraced my actions towards suicide.Who knows,maybe tomorrow will be a better day.Not ideal(nowhere near that) still awful in fact,but not as bad.I know though that it will only delay the impending.I know that I will most likely kill myself in a few days time,at max,and I am fully okay with it.Thinking about it makes it eerily scary in a way.Not the thought of dying and eternal darkness.To be honest,I don't even know what I am afraid of.I never really felt like ""myself"".Like I am ""me"".Never felt that I deserved what I have,and didn't deserve what I don't.
I can't even find that bit of ""me"" to truly realize what I really am.Who I really am.I constantly feel like I am watching someone live their life in first person,rather than my own.This god-awful fucking feeling never leaves.It always makes me uncomfortable and awkward.It all was a result of one problem of mine
That one fucking problem that lead to my ailments doesn't even matter anymore.Nothing does.I was just in despair for I thought this problem is one I can't solve.Once I realized I can,it was too late.I stopped caring.That was the point of no return.I simply do not care.And not because I am an angsty,cynical,ungrateful teenager,but because I can't.All of my interests suddenly disappeared.But so did that problem,in a way.Many more appeared,though.
It is much worse now.I can only find comfort in music.Not always,but god,does it feel fucking amazing.Euphoric even.But I am sure it's not enough to stop me.And if it somehow is,what even is the point of continuing on this journey of pain and suffering others call life?My psychiatrist told me my condition really is fucked and it would take me 3.5 years minimum to fully recover.He tried to stay silent about the maximum.I found out that it could follow me to biological death,or,if lucky,last around
15 years.Don't know how to end this post,so I am just going to stop now"
I don't know how to open up,"I'm a 19 year old college student and I've had this problem for my entire life. I don't know how to be open about how I feel. I was bullied and neglected by my friends throughout high school and middle school, and I feel like this and past painful experiences have made me too afraid to tell people when I'm upset or how I feel about things in general. My college friends have been nice to me, but I feel like I'm starting to be neglected by them too because I constantly feel like I'm being left out of their conversations and when we hang out they hardly talk to me. I always come up with witty jokes to make them laugh, and they often tell me how talented I am, but I feel like I'm just an entertainer to them rather than a friend. I want to be able to have real conversations with them and tell them how I feel but they always ignore me and drown me out. I have asperger's, which makes this especially difficult because sometimes they get impatient with how slow I am to say things, and also it sometimes doesn't come out quite right and they don't fully understand what I'm trying to say when I do manage to get something out. Just being around them feels so degrading. If I talk about wanting to kill myself or being depressed they think I'm just joking so they think nothing of it and carry on talking to each other. When we get drunk together is the only time I have enough courage to say how I feel, but I'm still drowned out. If I had access to more alcohol I'd probably have a serious drinking problem because the only time I feel released from the pressure of social anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts is when I'm drunk. I'm unable to ease my depression from crying because I feel like I'm no longer physically able to. It's the worst feeling, being trapped inside your own mind.Maybe I don't give them enough to work with to deserve their care or respect. I sometimes feel like I don't give them enough of my attention to deserve theirs. I think of committing suicide all the time, but I've never gotten enough courage to try it, but I feel like I won't be able to live like this for much longer, because I'll soon have to face this while dealing with trying to find a decent job and facing the world."
This could be my last night,"I don�۪t think I can control myself anymore, I don�۪t trust myself to not do it. I�۪ve been depressed for a few years now, not diagnosed because I don�۪t dare to talk to anybody about it. I try to keep up a facade about being happy, I want people to like me.  I don�۪t think many people know how I feel, a few close friends might have figured it out, I�۪m not sure. I�۪m not sure why I�۪m depressed, I don�۪t have any good reasons. I�۪ve never had any problems getting friends or girls (even though I�۪ve never had a relationship) so I don�۪t understand why I fell this way.One year ago I moved away to college and it�۪s not going well, I�۪m failing classes and most days I don�۪t even leave my bed. Some friends in class have asked why I�۪m not going to the lectures but I make up excuses to seem ���cool�۝. Some days I put a knife to my throat just because I like the feeling of being in control of my own life.This story is probably incoherent and missing a lot of details but I just wanted to express how I feel. My first language is not English and I�۪m drunk at this moment, sometimes when I drink alcohol I forget how I feel but most times it just makes it worst, I think it�۪s part of the problem.Anyways thanks for reading, this might have been the last thing I�۪m ever going to write, I�۪m not sure yet."
I owe so much money...im so screwed,"I put myself in so much debt as i was too depressed to work.My parents bailed me out so much, i promised not to get anymore loans I was in a ldr relationship and i was supposed to come and visit for a few days. I coudnt afford it but he said i wasnt ""trying"" hard enough to get ahold of money (i couldnt work due to severe depression  and it felt like hed leave me if i didnt come up to see him so i got a loan to help me go up but the money was taken due to me oweing loads of money to other places. I got another loan out because i decided i was taking my life and i didnt care about paying it back. Ive wanted to tell them but everytime im around they say how little money they have and i know if i tell them theyll insist on paying it. I can pay it over time with benefots but i just feel so ill hiding this from them. I feel like a failure. I feel ike i shouldnt be alive. I just wish i could work and pay everuthng off. I owe 1000s but im too ill. Im just in a fucking mess and want to die. Im sorry for rambling"
Should I go to the ER?,It is all I can think about. There lays that happy medium between when I am intoxicated and when I am sober that I feel ok. I have been waiting to see someone to diagnose me for three months. I know I have so much to live for but I just don't feel it anymore. I want to die. I want to hurt myself and I am not sure if it is worth it to try anymore. I need help and I am not sure how much longer I can wait.
My boyfriend is suicidal and I have no idea what to do,"We moved to different countries for university. We planned on breaking up but ended up staying in touch because we missed each other. The only contact we have now is IMs and occasional phone calls.He's had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, but at least back then I could go to his place and hold him or if we weren't together I could, I don't know, call his parents or something.I don't know what to do now. He's currently living with some family friends, but I've never met them. I don't know his new address. Part of me is starting to think that if living is so evidently painful for him, am I even in the right to stop him?I feel like I'm doing this so wrong, trying to get him to see that his beliefs about himself are completely misguided and make no sense. But I'm deathly scared that if he doesn't have someone in his life to get him out of that cycle of thoughts, it's only going to get worse. I desperately just want him to at least try therapy.He called a psychological counselling call-line type of thing, and when he told them that he doesn't really see a purpose in his life anymore the woman told him it's just a ""teenage"" issue. I went from being thrilled that he's trying to get help, to wanting to push a call centre employee off a bridge. He, on the other hand, was more or less unfazed. He insists that therapy would never help him.His suicidal comments get more serious every time we talk about it. I feel cold sweat gathering on my back when he logs off after having a conversation.I feel selfish for constantly trying to change his mind without a true understanding of the fact that he's in legitimate pain right now. I just want him to stay alive so fucking bad."
suicidal and sad. how could I tell someone?,"I'm a fourteen year old girl who is a freshman in high school. I've dealt with depression for years, hiding it until one day I told my parents. They looked at me like I was broken, and everything made me uncomfortable. I started taking medicine. It got me feeling a little better, and I was improving so much, I was so happy, and then high school started. I fell down a cliff, and now I can't get up. They think I'm better. Though they're starting to suspect something's up, how I never go out of my room or anything. But as soon as they ask me, it's like the real me is trapped and my depression takes over saying, ""I'm fine, I'm just really tired."" Or when they ask me if I'm suicidal, ""No no no, I'm not. With school starting, I just haven't had enough time."" I don't even think. My mind just creates a situation that's not the full truth. Not even close. I don't know how to tell anyone. I'm living each day waiting for it to be over, until the only thing I look forward to is sleeping, and obviously, watching Netflix because tv shows consume me. Anyways, I can't live life like this, waiting for the day to be over, every single day, for the next four years. I think about suicide. But I can't do it because I think about my parents. How they'll miss me, I make them laugh, and that's what's keeping me alive, along with my dog. But I just can't stand to live like this any longer, and it's too hard asking for help. School is making me so suicidal. I've been really depressed before, but not so much where I actually envisioned my death and the least painful way to go through with it. Which is what I'm doing now. I'm sorry this is so long. I'm rambling out everything I have to say, which doesn't even seem like enough right now.
I just need help."
I think I�۪m already dead...,"...and I must have done something really awful stuff to be sent to hell. This constant and never ending circle of hopelessness, loneliness, false promises, making me believe even just for a fraction of a second that there is a way out, when there isn�۪t, teasing me and then laughing in my face when I realise it�۪s all lies.
I have done something horrible and I�۪m already dead. And hell is nothing like I imagined. There are no fires and burning for all eternity. Just a repeating simulation of life and then ripping the dreams and hopes out of my heart to punish me for my existence.Thinking back all the way to my childhood, I had dozens of surgeries even before I was 6, promising me to fix me but then another surgery and another promise. I started school and started it again at another school, going to high school and finishing it at a second one, then more surgeries, more promises to be normal, more false hopes to ever being a father, only to be laughed at when people realise what I was born with (or without), going to uni and taking that away from me then a second uni and taking that away from me too. Working my ass off to build up a career and either let me screw up or snatch it out of my hand so everything I�۪ve built and worked hard for comes crushing down on me. Over and over and over and over again.Wait until I just about to have enough, give me something to hold onto, watch me build something again and then just when I start to feel it�۪s worth living, take it away and throw me back into the pit.Schools, jobs, relationships, hobbies, friends, crushes, love... none of that is real. Just tools of torture that is out of my control.And the only way to break that cycle is to kill myself again. Then erase my memory, grown up again, torture me again, then kills myself again and the circle never ends.What other explanation is there? I know it�۪s my fault. It has to be.I get the message. Whoever sent it to me. I must do a reset, soon. Die again by my own hands, get sent deeper into the bowls of hell and see how long it takes until I realise again I need to die once more. And again and again and again.I have a countdown. A deadline I set years ago. I need to bring it forward and stop waiting. Stop trying. Stop living. Just... stop."
"13yrs old, have Anxiety and mild Depression, Going to End it tonight.","Please help me, my father also is diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, And depression. He is on a bunch of meds 24/7, which make him even more tired, so he lays in bed all day. Mom and dad aren't together, both are overwhelmed and sometimes take it out on me (Not physical, but mental) I have no friends, hard time keeping up with school, so im probably going to end it tonight. Thank you for listening and reading "
I'm tired of being me,"Everything I love is taken away from me. It's odd though, because I take it from myself. My anxiety makes me hate the things I love and I never think I'm good enough. Viola- gone. Cross country- gone. Basketball- gone. Everything- gone. I can never be proud of myself. I can never be happy with who I am or what I accomplish. In my eyes, I'm never enough and I never will be. I'm tired of being me. I'm going to hang myself. "
Hey everyone..,Hey I've been thinking alot about suicide today and it's never seemed so tempting at this point i just want peace but i can't get that where i am and i have nothing and nobody to turn too.. i find myself in a bit of a pickle
I keep trying but failing,"What the hell's the point anymore? Can't get into college, women hate me, no friends left and I get stuck with a bullshit job. Fuck it, I'll drink the damn bleach in my basement to end this shit."
I almost killed myself last night,I had the razor ready to slice down my wrists but I couldn't do it. I'm too much of a fucking failure to even follow through with it. I hate myself.
No safety,"Thank you for reading. I feel like I have no one that understands or gets it. I've always been extremely anxious ever since I was around 5 years old, and I have been depressed since about 11 years old. I've had recurring suicidal thoughts since about 13. I am now 24, and I wasn't diagnosed with chronic major depression until a couple of years ago. I've had my first attempt last year. I had a very intense fight with my mom; she was listening in on me telling my boss that I need a break from work because of my mental health problems. My goal was to end my life after that fight, but I still don't believe it was an attempt. I can't wrap my head around the fact I did attempt suicide because nothing happened. I didn't end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that I took. I could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself, and my dad telling her to ""put down the knife."" I snapped out of whatever mental break I had when I took the pills, and I told my Dad what I did. He drove me to the hospital afterward. I was treated, evaluated, and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks. The treatment I received worked for some time, but my depression came back around June. My suicidal thoughts started in July, and I have been cutting again to cope.
My family isn't exactly supportive. I have an older brother who has problems too, but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and I. He will call me ""anal whore"", slut, and use Christianity to put me down (he's not even a Christian). I am not comfortable dating or having relationships, so I don't at all. He constantly brings up the one and only guy I went out with a few years ago to tell me I'm forever his ""bitch"". He would text me offensive and creepy things before I started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family. They won't do anything. He is literally a troll. He will constantly say the ex-boyfriend's name or call me a bitch if my parents aren't around. He would make kissing noises and faces at me if I was around or drive by him. He has said (unprovoked) that I should kill myself after I was out of the hospital.
He can't keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect. He will act like a crazy jerk in our house, but he will quickly act ""normal"" if he is outside of our neighborhood. My dad tells me to ignore him, but how do you ignore something like that? He won't bother or threaten my father or other brothers.
He is about 6', and my mom and I are under 5'2"". He has smacked my mom in the face before, and I have gotten into physical altercations with him as well. My dad is usually there to stop them, but he doesn't have much authority. Ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out, he's stopped caring because it's my mother's responsibility. They keep allowing him to come back.
I don't feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore. The boy and I use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths, but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. He has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street, and he will do something obnoxious when I drive by him anyway.
My mom will constantly say ""he's not normal,"" but she allows him to continue living here. She owns the house, and I can't stand her enabling him. My brother is aware of this, and he has recently started shouting at my mom ""no power!"" I literally have nowhere else to go, and I don't have a car. I feel trapped.
I have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease, and it can prevent me from going to work or school. I feel like between my depression, disease, shame, and crappy family that I would be better off dead. If he went away, life won't be as depressing, and I can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often. I was already depressed before he started becoming a monster, but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house. Sorry for the long post. Thank you again for reading."
it fucking sucks having nothing,"no one cares about me, i dont do anything, i have no friends, my family does not like me. i have no skills or hobbies, i have nothing left. why is it so fucking hard to shoot myself in the face? well i dont own a gun for one, but what else can i do? i dont want to be in pain why is no way out painless"
Sick and tired of being sick and tired,"Everyday is a struggle. It is exhausting. Growing up I was always severely depressed. I couldn't talk to people because I had social anxiety, I was lonely and ate for comfort leaving me overweight. I felt like I was a freak who was built different. I found out recently I had kyphosis in my spine, plus a chest deformity. I spent the last three years with severe bulimia because I never knew the actual problem and was struggling with my weight, I went to treatment and I am relapsing again. Every day I have breathing problems, I can't digest anything properly, and my entire neck feels squished, leaving me with barely any energy. I now don't care about anything anymore, and I don't know if o would actually kill myself because I'm Christian. I am seeing a chiropractor soon, and am hoping on a miracle. Thanks for reading. I am not absolutely hopeless, but it is pretty damn close."
WHAT IS THE POINT,"i tried to kill myself at the beginning of summer and, even tho things have gotten dramatically better, i still feel so much regret for not getting the job done. life is going so well for me right now but i still feel an overwhelming sense of suicidal nihilism. i dont know if im being lazy or ungrateful, but i want everything to be over. i want to start cutting again but this time, never stop"
If you don't have excellent social skills you're fucked,"I really wish I put more time into improving my social skills. Making more friends and being a fun person. I should've never caved in to the bullies or dogooders who called me insulting names and chased me out of groups for making social blunders and making someone uncomfortable  It doesn't matter that I have a degree, let alone an engineering degree nor does it matter that I have great experience and a decent gpa. It doesn't matter that I am dedicated enough to drive over 100 miles for interviews with companies and some times multiple interviews with the same company. It doesnt matter that i have several references who can speak the world about my skills and dedication. All that matters is how well I can entertain and talk to others. People in irrelevant fields or even without degrees walk into technical jobs all the time because they know so and so or they really sold people on this position.It's too late for me to improve my social skills. I'm 26. Most guys my age already have high paying professional jobs, been with dozens of girls, have tons of memories of vacations/road trips/exciting times with their friends and are engaged to or with long term girlfriends. 28 is the median age men get married. They all say it will be much harder to find a quality girl when you're older than when you're younger. I really want to find a nice girl and start a family. There's a huge stigma of older men ""reliving"" their youth and going after younger girls. I'm afraid that by the time I get a really good job and have the excellent social skills needed, it will be too late and everyone will have settled down. I decided that if I do not get a solid offer by the end of the year im going to shoot myself. It's easy and has a high succeeds rate. I haven't told my parents or therapist yet but plan on doing so within the next week. There s just no way I will be able to catch up to my friends and peers in life experiences, salary, and dating life. "
I feel like a failure of a human being.,"Low self confidence, low self esteem, low self worth...i feel like thats just setting me up for failure. Everyone I know seems to have some degree of competency in their lives in some area. I, however, do not.I stutter when I talk, I can't look people in the eye, I physically try to make myself smaller when I'm around others. I fumble around and have to constantly ask people what to do when I should know what to do. I'm absolutely convinced no one wants me around, and even though I'm told time and time again that people do want me, I refuse to believe it. No one could want a person like me in their friend group. I'm so hard on myself, despite the fact that I havent tried very hard to begin with. I can never seem to commit to something for more than a day.The only thing im good at is wasting time and resources, sleeping, and...thats it......I know pills is one of the least effective ways to go, but, at the same time i dont care. I just want to rid the world of a waste of space and time and resources... I dont deserve the air I breath, or the money it costs to buy me food....I just wish that I was able to completely write my suicide note to adequately apoligise to everyone i know..."
You will all agree that I should die,.
Dont see options...,"I'm not sure how to start this, I've given it a great deal of thought and I'm ready, I have the stuff I need, and I'm tired.  I feel like I struggle every day.  As a trans person I struggle with identity and coming out of an abusive childhood I struggle with an absolute lack of self worth.  I have no concern about myself especially over others.  I was diagnosed as bipolar awhile back and I've been struggling to live with that, and everything to do with it.  Meds, I'm over medications, I take so many to just function.  Acceptance, I don't feel there is any acceptance, at work people are nice to my face but talk about me behind my back as if I'm a piece of shit. I'm tired, I'm so tired of just chugging through life.  My finances are shit (3 defaulted student loans, I owe the IRS tens of thousands in taxes), I've fucked up the last two serious relationships I had, I'll never have my own kids, my brain sometimes feels like it can't process the fact that I'll never actually carry a child, nor will I be able to contribute to a child.  Why would I want to have kids when I can barely take care of myself.  I have the means, I've been saving up my heart medicine and psych medicines.  Should do it.  Just need to prepare some things, make sure my Dog has a place, make sure all my stuff I don't want friends and family finding are gone.  It wont be much longer now.."
I think I will kill myself.,"I am looking at you
at all the pain you cause me and the pain I cause you
and I wonder if you would be better off without me.
If everyone was.
You would be sad for a while
and so would your son be.
I am such a horrible person for saying this. For inflicting that pain on him. on you.
I have a job.
a room
I create art
I have you
and I want to kill myself.
I won't tell you
I won't tell anyone.
I don't know how to do it because I wish no one would have to find me. "
I'm just scared,"I know I need to get better, and I know I want to get better but I keep thinking if I get better I'm gonna see how much worse it actually is then my head makes it. I'm scared my partners will no longer love me and create a distance between us because of how ingraned into my personality my disorders are?? I'm so fucking scared because I've been going to N instead of T for support more recently because she has some of my same symptoms with her disorders so she understands better, but it made T feel like I don't need him anymore so I'm scared of how much worse he'd feel if I was better. I just want to dissapear and not be scared and not be worried about fucking anything up or trying to fix me. If i was just gone I feel like they'd be better off? and I know it's not true but I can't stop thinking it"
My friend made me cry last night,"I hope I'm posting in the right place. Anyway, one of my best friends told me she was going to commit suicide last night. She didn't thankfully but I'm still shocked about how serious she was.Another friend and I were texting with her and I ended up writing her a small heartfelt message. It was her response that got me tearing up.She told me that she was thankful for the message and really appreciative of me and our other friend for always being there for her. It was really genuine. She said she really loved us and thanked me again before saying she was just going to sleep it off. I woke up this morning to her saying she was still here.I cried last night because I seriously couldn't imagine a world without her. I was hurt. We've all got our issues but these two people are my best friends. We're still just 18 year old kids. Seeing one of them that low had really started to break me down.I don't know what else to say really. I'd like to think that what I said actually got through to her in the end and made her reconsider. I don't want to experience anything like that again. Also I'm sorry for the long post. I just feel I have to get this off my chest. Thanks."
Going to end it tonight,Heading out soon to pick up sleeping pills and a rope.It's been three decades. I am the most proactive person I know and nothing changed much at all.
I didn't deserve to be a mom I don't deserve to be here,"Everything I want to love and cherish turns to ash in my mouth. I sabotage myself by my own weakness and lack of a spine that's only encouraged by escapism and addiction. I could have been a mom by now but I couldn't stop drinking. I didn't know I was pregnant but it was too late. The man that I love didn't want me to be the mother of his child and who could blame him. Nothing about me deserves the gift of a child. I wanted so badly to be a mom but I would never burden my kid with the responsibility of being my savior. I am broke, unemployed, alcoholic and trapped in an abusive relationship anyways so I have nothing to give. I knew it would have been a girl. She would talk to me in my dreams. Everything was so clear it was like making snow angels out of sand in a glass castle. I was so so happy that she chose me. But I failed her. I didn't stand up for her. He wanted me to have an abortion. He tore down my character he told me I would ruin his life and hers. So I did it. I killed her. She was the size of a dot but I fucking killed her. I want to think that I did it for her but I know that I am a coward and a piece of shit. She deserved better.I am going to drink myself to death. I have enough of xanax to mix to go to sleep forever. I just want to see her and hold her and tell her how sorry I am that I couldn't be her mom. I'm so sorry. "
I fucked up. I fucked up. I really fucked up.,"I accidentally deleted hours worth of code... the assignment was due on Wednesday but we get two buffer days before they wont except it. Now I've totally fucked up the easier assignment in the class. Now, in my senior year, im gonna lose my scholarship and flunk out of college and lose the job i had lined up. I fucked up. I'm gonna be the joke of the family. everyone else can get through college but I can barely do laundry without bawling my eyes out. I just keep hitting myself saying ""i want to die, i want to die"" and eating everything I have in the pantry out of anger. I'm not touching the booze, that's not where I need to be now.I WAS gonna go to the hockey game and then the pre-release for the new Magic cards, but now im panic-coding in a frenzy to get at least a turd of a working program. I've done this all to myself. I don't deserve anything.FUCKMaybe this is why nobody loves me... I should have died in that car crash."
We are not important.,"I've been off drugs for 7 months. I've got my life back together aside from paying court fines and debt. But nothing seems worth it. Life off of drugs reminds me why I wanted nothing to do with the world and prioritized amphetamines. I didn't have to feel or operate, I was on autopilot.  Present day I hate work and can't find peace or closure. I don't feel like any of this is actually worth it. Life doesn't feel worth it and this isn't some tantrum. I just don't see the point, I have loved ones but they have their own lives. They talk about how I'm so important to them but they have no idea what goes on in my head. They don't understand that I could see such little value in my life. I've recently plotted numerous times on killing myself somewhere isolated where I wouldn't be found or crashing my car. Anything that couldn't be pinned to an actual suicide so they wouldn't blame themselves. It's not anyone's fault but mine, and I truly understand that. A good friend of mine took his life and I never hated him for it, and I didn't blame myself for it. If I care so much about not wanting to hurt my loved ones is that reason enough to stick around?"
I drown myself in alcohol.,I drown myself in alcohol because people around me don't want me to drown myself in a lake. I didn't realise how difficult my thoughts were getting out of hand. I didn't realise the way I was thinking was NOT normal. I realised I wasn't happy with myself. I realised I hated myself more than anyone had ever hated me. I didn't even realise I drank way too much but I drink. I drink and drink and drink hoping I would never have to face reality but...
Wish I Was Never Born - Tonights The Night,"If i had a choice of being in heaven or non existence, id choose the latter. My one and only wish to never have been born / not exist. i hate humans. I will never sentance a soul to life on earth by breeding. I will hang myself from a bridge on the main road. Hopefully tonight when i jump over the bridge with a rope tied to my neck and one end to the metal railings it snaps my neck instantly so no one can save me."
I hope to see her when I sleep,"When her arms come up and rest upon my neck,
And her lips purse to a peck,
Who is this girl I see at night?
I may never see her once, I awake,
So no chances I will take,
I'll sleep until I can't no more.I'm sorry."
I just don't wanna fight myself anymore,I've felt this way since I was a kid. I know life has made me strong. I know I CAN keep going but I don't want to. I just want it to be over. I don't want to hurt the people in my life but I don't want to be here. Life has given me no reason to believe it's ever going to be anything more than what it has been. I have no hope for the future and I don't want to keep getting hurt. I think about this stuff all the time. I try to talk to people about it but I've heard it all before. Nothing anyone says can make me feel any different. I just don't feel like the good is worth all the bad.
I feel like its all been a lie..,"I just want to get my thoughts out. I don't know who to go to. I don't need reply or care really.. I'm 18 I just graduated high school and I've seemed to have always lived with depression. Everyone always said it will get better. Life gets better, and in a way they weren't wrong. My urge and need to die has lessened. Though I really wish it hadn't. My life has completely gone to shit. I'm living paycheck to paycheck trying to finance moving in with my girlfriend after she gets home from basic training for the army. I've never gone to bed hungry until recently. I've never limited myself to one meal a day because I can't afford it. I lay at home when I'm not working waiting for my motivation to come home because she's the only thing that makes me feel good for anything greater than a fleeting moment. I'm so disappointed in myself for not attending college yet, and I don't know if I ever will. Though I know I won't find life meaning without pursuing science. It's my only career interest. I'm looking forward to an empty life knowing there's only one option.. I know I could end all the problems and seemingly endless suffering right now, but I'm too scared. I'm only hoping I reach a breaking point and it gets the better of me. I don't want to watch myself get any worse, but there's really nothing I want to do I want to pursue a career in something I love but then I realize.. I don't love any of it anymore. I'm so hollow. I've become a man but my soul never grew with me. I'm basing everything I enjoy by the fact I used to. Please let tonight be my last, or give me the strength to make it so.."
Realisation / time to vanish,"We're to start.I've got bipolar and whilst writing this I'm on a serious down so it's a struggle to even attempt to express my feelings. But I feel kinds hopeless. I believe I'm only truly happy when I've got something to look forward too. That thing was university. This has suddenly been snatched from me as I was not invited to join back the second year of my college course. Reasoning behind this is because I work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students there I'm older ( 21 ) so have responsibilities and such. Luckily I've been offered a position at another college to do their send year. This means though my job I currently have wouldn't be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey. So that part is really getting me down and also I've had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house. My mother despises me and my farther left before I was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence. Meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me don't give a shit. It sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend. Now she won't even answer me when I talk to her just ignores me. So leaves me feeling alone. I also have a girl I've been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her. I don't miss her. And that worries me but I just don't feel it. I wouldn't be upset if she left me but I don't want her too. I just want to feel normal and not
A emotionless twat.Feel like there's nothing left. We live. We die. What's the point of waking up unhappy. "
Sucidal thoughts,"I�۪m 20, I currently work in retail after leaving a web development job which I didn�۪t enjoy so I left after a week (it gave me depression feeling like a guinea pig) I�۪ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now (she�۪s 18) and I�۪ve been living at her parents house since we dated, my mum has a two bedroom flat but she keeps meeting random guys and sometimes I hear them having sex and it gets to me, she�۪s a single mum as my dad left me at child birth, we don�۪t really get on and talk rarely My girlfriend is now going to university (left today) and I�۪ve depended on her so much for happiness that I don�۪t know how to be happy without her, we�۪ve talked about the future to the point of me engaging her in a few years time, I�۪m moving by chance to a new job opportunity 20 minutes away from her but will only be on the odd occasion be able to see her on the weekends and I can�۪t cope with the idea of that, I trust her but I depend on her and I fall down the ditch of suicidal tendencies when I�۪m alone, I�۪ve researched what I can do and where I can get the equipment. I�۪ve not discussed this with her because I�۪m not here to blackmail someone into submission, that�۪s both selfish and weak on my behalf, I worry that no job will satisfy me and I�۪m in an endless loop that�۪ll make me unhappy, I�۪m not happy with that amount of time I�۪ll be able to see her compared to other people and I just can�۪t live happily with myself as I feel like I�۪ve been born to die, I never seem content with what I have and I can�۪t cope alone and alone is exactly what I�۪m going to be, Is it really so bad just for me to call it quits, I�۪ll break her heart but I feel like there�۪s no other way and that this is the end. I can hand on heart tell you now. That if she broke up with me that I would 100% end it, I�۪m not waiting for that eventuallity because I know she isn�۪t the type but I feel like I need to do this for me, people are born for every statistic, to be killers and everything else, and I feel that because of how my life has affected me, that only death can set me free. But I always think this way when I�۪m down but maybe this is the bullet that�۪ll get me out, I�۪m just not sure what to do and everything seems to lead to my unhappiness and abandonment issues to get the end of me Edit: we have spoken about how I am as I lost the will to live when she went away on a holiday, it�۪s not jealousy it�۪s just me not being ok with myself, I tell her I don�۪t want to talk to her about my problems all the time because that pushes people away even if they say it doesn�۪t"
I just want someone to talk to,I don't want to do this alone. I finally built the courage to tell the one person that I can go to that I was going to kill myself. He blew me off. Now I have nobody. I know it's pathetic but I just need someone to talk to. I just don't want to be completely alone when it happens
Nothing changes,"I used to be a drug addict and dealer. I hated my life and everyday I hope I would find the drive to kill myself or overdose one day. I thought it was my rock bottom. Now I'm sober and somehow managed to get to a job the pays extremely well. But I still want to die. More now than back then. Every single day for most of the day I think about it. I look at myself in the mirror and I want to put a bullet through that person's head. I'm scum and I don't deserve life, love, happiness, friends and family. I can't keep on like this for much longer. I already have for far too long."
How to stay happy?,"I have posted on here several times before. Each time, I have been talked out of killing myself. However, I am tired of being talked out of it. I want to either stop being miserable, or just die. I recently quit my job at McDonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college. I am scared of my horrible grades, as I think I may go on academic probation. After that, I will have large student loans pilled up on my head, no job, and no way to ever get a job that isn't a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself. Therefore, I have decided if I go on probation, I'll kill myself. I have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately. I think about what death would be like and ways I could quickly die about 70% of the day. What is bothersome to me, is that other people who have the same situation, or even worse situations, are able to stay happy. This is frustrating to me, not because these people are happy, but because I feel like I am completely missing something that these people are. Is it genetic? Is it a mindset? If it is either, how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics, after all, we are who we are.TL;DR I am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations, and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless I can find a way to stay happy. I am tired of being talked out of it, this is a final decision. Instead, I want advice to be happy."
I think I've realized what hurts the most about all of this.,"And that's that I didnt even get a choice. I was born with this difference, disorder, illness, whatever you want to call it. I didn't get to choose to be normal, and even if i had started the treatment options earlier, my body and mental health would have always been fucked. I cant stand being trans. If i wake up tommorow still feeling dysphoria I might really end it. "
i think my mom is going to kill me,"i don't want to die right now. i love my friends too much.but i might have to. my sister's boyfriend's mom wants to talk to me. i am in a mental health awareness club that my mom doesn't know about, and so is my sister's boyfriend. my mom is deep in denial that i have any kind of mental illness and has invalidated me, mocked me, screamed at me, and threatened to hurt me for showing signs. i wasn't supposed to let anyone at school know. i have to find places to hide if i'm going to break down at school, because if the counselor knows my mom will somehow find out.my mom's on the phone with his mom right now. the club is the only thing my sister's boyfriend and i have in common. if my mom finds out i'm not sure what she'll do. i'm going to try to tell her it's just for leadership/to help friends but i'm really scared. my mom screamed at me and called me a lazy ass because i told her i was slightly anxious about school. i don't know what's going to happen and i don't want to live in an environment where it's not safe for me in any way. i don't want to live thinking i'm alone in this. if my mom finds out, i think i will have to. or i could just not live at all.to whoever is reading this, i love you. i'm sorry you were brought to this sub and i hope with all my heart things get better for you. i am going to do my best to stay alive for my friends, and i hope you'll find a reason as well.i'll try to update this.thank you for listening.edit: it was a false alarm. she wanted to talk about something else. i'm so relieved but my heart is still racing. it sucks to be living in an environment that scares me as much as it does. but thank you for caring, you guys were there even when i thought i was going to die. that means a lot to me. thank you. i love you guys."
I am tired of being transgender,"My biggest problem with being Trans is that I feel no one believes me. Even Cis people that ""understand"", or say they're an ""ally"". It feels like everyone around me thinks I'm crazy. I'm not REALLY a woman trapped in a male body, I just think I am.And you know what? Maybe it's true.But that doesn't make it hurt any less. Every time I see a group of girls, talking about nothing, knowing that I will NEVER join them. NEVER be one of them. It feels like being punched in the gut. And it doesn't go away. Everyday, again and again. If I'm just crazy, it's damned persistent.Everything I see online, and at work, tells me that the Trans community will never be accepted. Feminists see us as men, and don't want us anywhere near them. Lesbians see us as Men. (And I'm attracted to girls, lucky me! /s) Men just see us as gay. Gay guys want to drop the ""T"" from LGBT altogether.The only treatment for being Transgender is to transition. But as I'm constantly reminded, that won't make me a ""real"" woman. So what's the point?And so this is why I want to kill myself. It's become increasingly obvious to me that Trannies have no place in this world. I have no place in this world. And I'm done fighting my Dysphoria everyday, only to be mocked and told that's it's not real.It's just not worth it anymore."
I hope I get killed before I kill myself,"Someone PM me. Please. I don't want to do it.I don't want to die at all. I just want the pain to end. If I die, I want it to be quick. Like a car crash. I could handle that. Because at the end of the day, my mom wouldn't be the mom with the depressed kid, she'd be the unlucky mom. There wouldn't be anything she could've done to prevent it. I don't want my friends beating themselves up over a problem they couldn't fix. They'd remember the good qualities I had. The school wouldn't have any class about depression and how to tell the signs. They'd just hold a small vigil no one would go to and I'd be forgotten as quick as the crash was. "
I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts.,"I've always told myself that I wouldn't succumb to my emotions, especially after my brother took his own life a couple of years back. My thoughts on the topic of suicide have gradually grown over time.I'm sustaining myself with a job I've worked for 3 years now and I'm currently enrolled in college. I've had to see every single one of my friends go on to do better things, while I sit here doing the same old shit and have the feeling that I'm not making progress. I lost the best girl I ever had in my life because I let my anxiety get the best of me and ruin the relationship.I tend to talk to myself and sort issues out and I try to tell myself that it's all temporary but I'm starting to lose faith. I found myself today planning it all out in my head while I was at work. I don't know if I'd actually go through with it but I actually thought of ""How?"" and ""When?"" and ""Should I write a note?"".I don't know what's wrong with me and it might just be a phase, but it's getting worse."
It feels heavy.,It feels as if it's an envitablity rather than just a possibility. It's like a leach has been attached to my soul for years slowly sucking away who I am.I don't want to be here anymore.I'm tired. End.
I want to die but I'm a coward,"I have been suicidal since the age of 6, but never went through with it. Why? Because I am a fucking coward. I don't have the balls to do anything, including killing myself. The only reason that I have lived this long is because I'm a fucking pussy. Well, I've found a way to get past all that. When I get extraordinarily high in combining whatever the fuck I have on me, that fear disappears. All I want to do is die, and I'm ready to do it. All I have to do is pop those pills, drink a ton while tripping and I'm good to pull the fucking trigger. It'll be quick, I won't feel a damn thing. I'm a failure as a human being and I don't belong in the gene pool. The sooner I kill myself the sooner it'll all be over and nothing will matter at all by then.What is the fucking point of living like this?"
I feel like I'm losing my friend and idk what to do,So my friend has recently lost friendship with his best friend. It looked complicated and she was very in love with him. They stopped being friends for unrelated reasons. He is very depressed and doesn't take his depression seriously or believes he is. I feel like he's pushing everything back and acting tough. So he does not get help for him self. And he's had a suicidal history. Ever since losing his friend his personality is nonexistent now. He was down and depressed looking before they met but I thought it was his regular personality. After he met her he would actually smile occasionally and be in a completely different mood. So it finally clicked and I realized he shouldn't be that way. Now he's way worse than before. I'm afraid he's not taking care of himself. He's closed off so idk how to go about asking him without making things worse. Idk any close friends of his who I can tell. Idk what to do and I'm afraid time is ticking. Any suggestions?
"November, maybe","Two days ago, I decided that if the upcoming month really went as horrible as I feel it will, I'd be gone by November. It's the sweet-spot between various deadlines I have no control over, and more specifically the month I'm liable to be homeless. Homeless or shoved back in with my step-father's horrible parents-- and I  choose the former in place of returning at the heels of hags that threw us away like they did all their sons; said I was on track to becoming a whore, called my brother and mother both wastes of space. I will be positively  if I go back to that fear of just walking to the bathroom, of literally living in the attic and being side-eyed for breathing. I've only told three people what they did to us, so if anything, getting it out is cathartic. Catharsis, however, does nothing to help what extends past emotion, though I wish someone would hold me for just a moment. I literally cannot exist. Don't have the papers. Don't have the papers to get the papers. Things wouldn't improve if I just packed myself across the country and stayed with friends that only half know me, nor would they really improve if I had the money to fill my college seat fee. That one was a real eye opener-- spending years clinging to the notion that college would save me, no matter the debt or trials, only to have what hope that proffered stripped. I swore I would  it work, but here I am, drowning in unmarked, unexpected territory. Such is life.My parents would separate if it weren't for the fact that we are dirt-poor and completely reliant on my now jobless step-father. My maternal family is somewhat excommunicated, and they're hardly any better off than we are. They're rotting in their town, just as we are in this wasteland. My mother and I joke bitterly that we've got some multi-generational curse-- maybe that's just the curse of poverty and abuse cycles? Speaking of, the day we found out  may come our way, my parents got smashed, as per usual, and fought. Fifth or so time now within the past year that my step-father has stormed off in the night. Twice that we know he attempted to leave us and later shove in our faces how easy it was. Three days in and they haven't said a word to one another. He's gone all day, supposedly at his parents' place, but we have suspicions that align with missing chunks of money. No one seems to understand the gravity of my situation, though my interaction is increasingly limited after a long period phoneless, internetless, and barely eating. ( We moved across the country when this all started-- we used to move pretty frequently, but it's been three years. I was homeschooled during that time and never allowed to leave our apartment.) No single thing can be remedied without tracing back to the roots of others, hence why I've only ever turned in full bearing to Reddit, with it having at least a grain more anonymity while unfurling my life story than turning to acquaintances, of course. It lets me still keep that whole gdforsaken cordial distance with them; what few, positive interactions I have since I don't want to burden them with this. They may get bits and pieces because I'm not one to lie, but...I can't tell them this. It's too much, they shouldn't have to even shoulder that burden briefly. I'm done. Very done. I've got my cat and my little brother, but my friends are busy and haven't seen me in years (if at all) and my mother is...complicated. She poured out all of her disappointments in me recently; my religion, my school (despite having an offer and a huge scholarship thanks to years plastering myself to good grades), my existence...I feel so lost. I'm not allowed outside-- haven't been since moving here a few years ago-- and can't even afford myself a breath of fresh air. I don't see the point anymore. Things will  be getting better because legally, there's nothing for me to do. There's nothing I can take into my own hands, no simple mentality change. I'm thoroughly fucked at the most crucial point in my life, and I feel hollow. Alone. Frightened. I pray November isn't it."
I'm afraid to go the my therapist.,"In college abroad and after a week of my exam, i got my results and I'm devastated. Luckily i'm not failing but my grades are lower than what i expected. I'm just hoping that i can manage until the end of the semester. I've tried to handle the start of my college and it has been difficult. The worst part is that i'm afraid to go to classes because once everything crams together it's going to be difficult for me to handle. I've been going to my counselor frequently and i took this suicide test or something (it felt kind of useless since it follows through a score or something) and she advises me to schedule an appointment with a therapist or a psych. The hard part is that i'm afraid to hear the result that i'm filled with anxiety or even depression."
can someone talk to me (CA),i called the hotline a bunch of times and they tele me to to therapy or don't bother them.... is there anyone at all who would be willing to talk to me? DM for my phone number
"My whole family is dead, I have no friends, I feel trapped in memories and I'm hallucinating.","I'm 29 and my life was very normal growing up. Was valedictorian in college, had two seemingly loving parents and a fiancee I'd been dating since I was 18. About six years ago I discovered that my fiancee was cheating on me and I was devastated. She quickly married this guy after six years of dating me. I moved back in with my parents and things were ok for a while. I had a good job but I was having a lot of problems getting back on my feet emotionally. Then it turned out that my mom was cheating on my dad and he confronted her about it. That week they both died in a car accident, with the suspicion that my mom (the driver) did it on purpose as a murder-suicide kind of thing related to the affair. I am living in their house, my childhood home, and am starting to have a hard time paying the rent. I've been able to keep it up for now because the bank is letting me keep paying it as the executor of their estate but I don't even know if I'll be able to refinance and it's cheaper than paying rent anywhere. I might end up homeless if it doesn't work out.I am in therapy and it does not seem to help. I don't get social media and don't even have a phone. The one friend I did have killed himself a few years ago, before all this happened.I have this feeling that my life is not real and that everything from this point on is just meaningless. Whatever happens I feel like I'm controlling a body that is not my own, and I have these thoughts that all ""I"" am is just a series of electrical impulses going through meat. When I die I'll forget I ever existed, forget the concept of existence in the first place because there will be no conceptual realization of consciousness whatsoever. The universe will cease to exist and will be like it never existed, just like it must be for my parents now. All those experiences and things I've made, all the people I've ever met and loved, will be unmade in an instant.During my daily routine of going to my office and then home, I am starting to see things. I am seeing the lights turn out when they are actually on. I am seeing faces peering at me from doors left cracked. I see my parents and even my old girlfriend in my dreams every night and wake to a reality that is not my own. I can barely plod through work and my days seem to happen without me having any knowledge about them. I sit at my desk and am vividly trapped in endless loops of memories - songs, experiences, movies, smells that defined my life throughout high school and college, the things that seem so desperately to be ""me"" even though the world goes on without me. Since the day I graduated I feel like I have been in stasis, watching the world around me change and evolve while I slowly degrade due to incompatibility. The loss of my fiancee was a big blow, and the death of my parents is a far greater shock that I cannot even describe. They were really my only friends, and now I am caught in an endless cacophany of betrayal and bottomless sadness.I just heard a baby cry in my office and there is nobody else here. I have about ten or so moments like this during the day.Sometimes I dream that I will hang myself by the neck over a small bridge near my house. It's never a rope but always a heavy metal chain. Sometimes I can feel a loose link cutting into my neck as I take the plunge over the side. It's endless - either the hanging or my lost loved ones, or both. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, or even more importantly WHY I should keep it up. I feel like my entire existence is a mistake and that I will always be spending my life pining for a time long gone, listening for voices long dead.I don't know what I'm doing here but I had to type this out and I don't know if it made things better, but I typed it out nonetheless. Thank you for listening."
Wanting to end it all soon in a week or so because of what happened.,"I fucking almost got myself and dad in an accident while I was practicing driving. I can't handle driving anymore it's too dangerous for me and I'm a whimp. I also tried self harming and attempted to scratch my arms but there was little white marks that had minor pain because of I was a pussy of doing so. one of the scariest shit happened to me when I was driving so the light turned yellow then to red and i stopped in the middle of an intersection luckily the car packed up and then I hit park, got all nervous and hit drive my dad got so pissed and said ""you stupid you shouldn't have stopped"" in punjabi for stupid I am not stupid though, I legit panicked. I'm sorry for posting here again, all these mistakes are killing me. It's best if I don't drive at all, it's not very safe for me and risky. I'm really selfish in this, and lately I've been giving people attitude, I don't deserve to live. I want to end it soon. Some of the posts here unanswered makes me feel really sad :(."
I think my friend killed herself.,"I'm in vacation right now, my third day here. My friend always told me, since I mentioned the trip, that I shouldn't go (jokingly, or at least I thought). I found out yesterday, as she told me, that she didn't eat all day and cut herself. She was now at the hospital, and I wasn't that worried because it seemed like she was going to be fine. I couldn't sleep last night so I've been sending her many messages hopping she'll react with a smile as she wakes up, but I'm afraid she won't. One of the last things she told me is that they gave her something (the doctors) and she was feeling dizzy. I feel like just maybe, that wasn't a good sign. I never cry (because I can't) but I now am tearing up, a little. I hope that she's actually just sleeping but I have no idea, and that is killing me.I am honestly thinking of killing myself if she does it ��� what's the point. She was (and hopefully is) my best friend even though I hate classifying my friends. We kissed before I left, and I honestly like her. I just don't want her to be gone. I cannot wait to get back to my home country to hopefully see her.Edit: I got a text from her Facebook account: it said that she had passed away; however, like five minutes later she said it was just a prank. And even though that is one of the worse pranks ever, at the end I loved it  a prank because it meant that she was still living."
Jumping,I've gotten so obsessed with jumping. I can't go 15 minutes without thinking of jumping. I just wanted to get this off my chest while I ruminate more on jumping.
"To those who stopped before attempting suicide, what made you stop?","I'll share my story since I asked the question.For me, I was sitting in my restroom at home with a loaded visa card looking to buy carbon monoxide. When I found it I started shaking uncontrollably, and after I started crying I realized I wasn't going to go through with the act.Was wondering, do you guys have a point in time where you just ""stopped"" and decided you were going to try this thing called life again? Thanks"
I just am so tired,"I know I've posted a lot on here I'm really sorry- but I'm 15 and I'm just so tired of this depression. It's been three months, 3 suicide attempts, and my family really emotionally Abuses me. I'm so exhausted of fighting this. I cannot even breathe. I'm breaking down just sobbing because I'm so so depressed. I have been 16 days clean from self harming and it's been hell.  I just don't know how to handle this depression. I'm drowning. Please any suggestions "
I'm giving it ten years,"I guess none of yall have to take me seriously since I'm not a threat . But this year has been absolute hell, and part of that is because I realized that things have  hell for years - I just always ignored it or didn't realize what was wrong. They've been bad for my 21 years... a quarter of my life... so why should they get any better? That's just not how my life works apparently. So I'm giving it ten years. If it's not better by then, I'm out. My five year plan involves getting a real job, moving out of my hometown and away from the family who has caused me so much pain, and getting married (hopefully to my current partner). Five years is the goal, but I'm giving it ten just to be safe. I'd like to leave the country by the end of my ten years, but I don't know if that's my deciding factor in whether or not I'll off myself. Like I mentioned, my family has absolutely ruined my life. My childhood was taken away, and now the prime of my life is being ruined too. I hate them all, except maybe my sister. They can't help me. My partner already listens to enough of my bitching about mental health, and I know it's going to push him away if I keep it up. I started seeing a therapist a few weeks back, but he's not really helpful. Progress so far has been disgustingly slow. I'm better off coping on my own.I'm just so sick of fighting. I'm so fucking tired of hoping and dreaming that one day I'll be happy, and then when I finally feel like things may be getting better, something bad happens and it's all stolen violently away. I just want to be happy. Please, fuck, let me be happy. If I can't be happy in ten years, which is such a long time away, then I don't see the point in prolonging the suffering. "
I almost got the Baker act,"God fucking hates me.  I get it, I'm tired of swimming upstream, I'm ready for the shitshowof a life I'm living in o come to an end.  My existence is interfering with the happiness of others, and I'm dutifully prepared to end my life for the greater good.  Fuck you, God. Fuck you, you fucking self righteous cunt.  I used to not believe in God, but now I know God exists.  Because God fucking hates me, and I experience it's hate consistently.  I've had enough hate, if got hates me so much and won't kill me, I'll take care of it myself.  I'm sorry I wasn't better than I turned out to be. Good luck."
"Need urgent help, friend just took 5 nurofen and panodol mixed together down with alcohol","He just told me this after he's done it, could he die? Should I call someone?? Need help"
I've never felt more free in my life than knowing I'm going to die tonight.,"Not gonna put my whole sob story out there because you all have enough to deal with. I just know it's the right thing to do. Tonight I told someone I was going to kill myself and he said that I was too much to handle. I think he's right. But I just needed to say goodbye to someone. I don't even have anybody to leave a note to. Goodnight & goodbye all, and I truly hope you find a different path than mine. "
Can someone talk to me and calm me down?,"I really need to talk to someone right now. Everyone I can talk to is either busy or don't reply, i assume because they're fed up with me talking to them about how miserable and stressed out i feel.I'm so anxious and antsy and worried and I feel like I'm about to implode. Would someone please talk to me and help me calm down? :("
What's the point?,"Things get better just so they can get even worse.
We're expected to contribute to society but in the end all we get is death.
Everything I've given has gone to waste.
I have nothing left, I have no love to give.
I don't want to exist anymore. "
"Tonight, or maybe tomorrow","I have wanted it to be over for ages. Food tastes like dust. The concern of others is irritating. The instence of the doc that ""it gets better"" reads like so much bullshit. I have no more little lies to tell myself to get myself out of bed in the weekend. I dont have it in me to go on and get ""better"", whatever that means. If its anything like losing weight I no longer have the capacity for that mental effort.The train lines below are dark and quiet at night. A few more hours and I may go and lie down on one. Will be interesting what if anything comes next, if it isn't nothing"
I just...I can't anymore.,"There is nothing that is going to bring me out of this hole I'm in. I tried so hard to be happy On my own-- be my own happiness because it's foolish to expect anything out of others. I'm twenty two years old I know how fickle and awful people can be. I just want this stop. I want everything to stop. I don't want any of this anymore. I can't do it. I can't be the person everyone expects me to be. I'm too fragile, confused and tired. I can hardly take care of myself anymore. I just want this to be over. I don't care who I leave behind at this point. Go ahead and call me selfish, fuck you. Fuck you for thinking everyone else is somehow STILL more important to me. I can't do this, I can't keep pretending I'm happy or that everything is going to be just fine. I'm so angry and tired at my core. ANYTHING would be better then this. I wish I could have stopped myself from even being born. I give up."
Can't live with or without her,"We had a falling out because of drama and now Im not going back to her because of various reasons it hurts a lot to talk to her. But after 2 years of friendship I dont think I can stand being without her anyway. She is a bit toxic but I was going through a really bad time when she came to my life when I was alone almost all the time and she was the first person I actually spoke to in a while. I dont know how to put the past 2 yrs of friendship in words because she really means a lot to me even though she was a pain to talk to at the same time. Im pretty conflicted because I feel like I would do better if i cut her out of my life but at the same time I feel like i lost something really important that ill never get back again. And it feels like it because in comparison to her, everyone else seems awful; they dont even want to try to be similar to her. At 20 I have been seriously considering suicide because everything seems really awful and painful without her in my life, i wont get her back so whats the point?I always think about how the scenario could have been different but it just makes it worse"
I wanna do it...,Don't do it. Just talk to me.
"Here�۪s my note, is this it?",I�۪ve just written my suicide note. I don�۪t know what to do anymore. It�۪s directed at my best friend who has slowly destroyed me over the past month.���
Now I understand that even family isn't enough to keep me going,"Sure I'm stuck at home helping care for a sick physically disabled mother. Will be for years more. Yet it's not enough for me to want to go on. I'm perpetually teetering on bankruptcy due to high expenses, a low income, and limited cash reserves. I have little chance of finding any other kind of work than my shitty part time job thanks to a useless degree and only 2 jobs in my experience. I can't afford to take on another loan for another college degree because my income is that low. I'm all alone most of the time with no friends or girlfriend thanks to how shit I am with people. I simply have no place in this world at all. Worst of all, my depression diagnosis turned out completely wrong. It's actually dysthymia.I quite simply don't have much longer to live. I'm tired."
I'm just really tired.,"I'm not going to commit suicide so maybe this is being posted in the wrong place but if a car were to hit me, or if someone shot me dead, or if some other event were to end my life. I wouldn't complain. Guess that means I'm just a coward who hopes to pin my death on someone other than myself. But at the point where I am, I don't feel sad, depressed, angry, alone, or any other feelings that people who have it much worse than I have. I just feel so tired. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. Tired of life, tired of who I am as a person, tired of what a waste I've become and just tired in general. And, I'm really tired of being tired."
It doesn't feel like there's any other way out.,"There's honestly just too much to even fit into one post. I have work tomorrow and I'm afraid to leave because I don't want my father to hurt my sister again. I just wish I could acquiesce this burden, but if I'd either have to drop out of school to live comfortably on my own in New York, take a slower course schedule and overwork myself while I go to school. I could barely handle 25 hours a week with school, I'm just going to be here for years having to stand in between them and defuse every fight.Dying just seems like the fastest way to not have to be responsible. Something's going to happen to her and it's going to be my fault. I just don't want to be there to see it happen. And I don't want to deal with what happens after."
I feel like I don�۪t have a choice anymore.,"I�۪ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for half my life now. Lately I�۪ve been reading a lot of stories from people that tried and failed and suddenly now wanted to live. I�۪m really wondering if that might be the only way to stop thinking about it so much. Maybe I need to give it a serious attempt before I can get better.I�۪ve come so close a few times the past few weeks. Everything is horrible in my life right now and it keeps getting worse all the time.The way I�۪m looking at it, if I succeed then no more problems. If I fail maybe I�۪ll want to get better. Anything has to be better than what I�۪m dealing with now.Honestly I don�۪t think I�۪ll ever get better. But this makes sense to me. Maybe it�۪ll prove me wrong if I don�۪t succeed.Idk what to do."
"22, M, My last week","I'm done. I'm going to die by the end of next week, and there's nothing that can stop me. University is awful, I never should have enrolled. I only did it because my family wanted me to. Now, in my last year, due to financial reasons, I have to live with my emotionally abusive sibling who makes me feel worse than trash every day, no matter what I do. Waking up feels like a crime. My parents know how I feel about the situation, and they agree it's awful but refuse to do anything about it. My closest friends know that I'm at my breaking point, and they aren't okay with it, but they're decent people who will accept my decision if it's what I want. I know this will destroy my family and friends, and I care, but not enough to suffer through this anymore. My DPDR combined with natural lucid dreaming make this world feel fake. All I want is to die so I can start over in some other life. If I die, my student debt goes away and I don't have to feel like this anymore. I'm not gonna wake up crying every day anymore. Goodbye, I guess."
Mental illness hope?,"Guys, I'm trying really hard, really damn hard. I'm pouring tears right now. I have intrusive thoughts that don't leave me. I've been having the for 6-7 months. From waking up to sleeping I think about the same thing all day. I had to quit working, and now I'm skipping school. I have no friends, and I'm rotting. I'm useless. I'm insane. I have held a rifle muzzle to my mouth but never took the shot. I have held knifes to my wrist and stomach but never punctured myself. I have tried really hard. I live with my mom, and I live her for how she has helped me, but I really have no hope. I've tried meds, self therapy, I don't know what else to try. I am going insane. I want to end my life before I become a maniac without a soul. I don't want to be selfish with my life and take it for granted, but granted you were in my shoes you would bot consider this a life, you would consider this hell. Please, how do I muster up the courage to end my life. Help, please."
My heart is telling me to go through with it,I thought this year would be differentBut my chest is tight and i feel like something is just telling me to get it over with
I been having thoughts. Dark thoughts.,"I am planning my way out. The pressure, hope, people�۪s eyes focused on me, i can�۪t take it.  I am Indian, living in U.K, I was brought here by my parents for a better life but I can�۪t have one. To have friends, I need to drink with them, party with them but I am not allowed too. It�۪s lonely, when you ���friends�۝ hang out and you....can�۪t. I can�۪t disobey my parents, because I know what they say is for my own good, I love them and I can�۪t disappoint them. If it�۪s hard for me, it�۪s hard for them too, they don�۪t have a friends, they live their lives in a loop. I can�۪t. I can�۪t ever disappoint them. I can�۪t understand the English language very well but I do my best, I am starting my university course. When people see my they think and say you are smart, you don�۪t have to try as hard as us. They�۪re wrong I try my hardest, when they get stuck they ask their parents to help them, when I get stuck, I can�۪t ask them because don�۪t English so I try harder for them and for myself.
I...I..am starting my course, it�۪s going to be hard, I might even fail, this will disappoint my parents, I can�۪t take that. I can�۪t take the fact, I have to pay 13k just because I have leave to remain, not irl. That�۪s my story. That�۪s my ending. Rather have my parents spend their saving on me, I should kill my self.
Anyways, even with all that saving they only support me for a year. So I can�۪t finish my course which is 4 years.
So this is my end. Thank you...."
I talk to my friends to get better but almost no one's responding,"And i really need someone I can talk to. I'm always there when they need to talk, why isn't anyone around when I seriously need one to talk to? My family is shit and all my friends neglected me, my three best friends didn't text me back. What's the point now?"
Steam friend help?,"Obviously this is a throwaway account, so let's get that out of the way first. So a friend on Steam, whom I don't really know outside of gaming contact, and hadn't talked to in about a month because life got in the way of gaming, was talking to me today. They told me they passed a deadline last week by which they intended to make an attempt, and the means by which they'd do it. They may be hinting at setting another deadline in the near future as well. What can I do? I would call 911, but I have no way to discover any information about this person. Thanks in advance."
time to go,"Despite supposedly things going well, I think it is time to go. The thought of continuing another year with a mental illness that has convinced me that I am inherently a failure, and will continue to do so sounds pretty unbearable. I have no idea why I continue a life that is inherently worthless. I don't want to anymore. So now it's time to plan the end."
This is it,There is no hope. Goodbye.  Nicole Marvin you were my only love.
End of my rope,"I lost my dream job in 2009. I havent been the same since. Ever since then, things have been going downhill. My wife and I stopped being intimate. We basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates. She makes more money than I do now and she takes care of 90% of the household expenses. The small amount of money I do bring in goes towards my debts. I have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago. I dont know why, but I just cannot do it. Adding to that, my health has gotten worse since then. I refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist. I just cant bring myself to do it. Instead, I drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest. I am now at the point where if I dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself, I wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself. Problem is, I am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that I cant see past that. It occupies my every thought. My wife is an incredible woman. She accepts my faults (most of them) and is incredibly patient. I am failing her. I have failed her in the past and if I am around for more years, I will continue to fail her. And fail myself. I can no longer accept this. I just turned 40. I dont want to turn 41. On my 40th birthday, spending time with my parents and wife, I looked out over the city and decided that Tuesday was the day that I needed to let them all move on. Now it is Friday and I dont feel any different. Family have gone home. Wife has a bright future. I feel like I am just a roadblock to prosperity. I remember when I was 19 and I was convinced that I would die before I was 21. I lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then. In fact, I should have died a number of times. Somehow, I survived and prospered. Then things went off the rails again. I guess this is what happens. And at the end of the day, I think Tuesday was always the logical conclusion. "
tomorrow.,"i wrote a letter to my family, in which i mentioned that im transgender and bisexual, googled a bunch of suicide related things, such as how long does it take to bleed out, all i have to do now is to inform my online friends that i will disappear and might not come online ever again. hopefully, they won't be asking too many questions. i don't want to make them panic. i just want to disappear.
i am afraid, to be honest. i'm not afraid of dying, but instead of what would happen if i were to survive it somehow.
it's all or nothing.
tomorrow, on september 23rd, i will, hopefully, finally die. "
I always just use reddit to stall,I need to just delete this stupid throwaway and finish the job before I convince myself to suffer another few months until I end up back here again. It's always the same
I�۪m about to,_��_
Fresher's Week at University is killing me. Absolutely killing me.,"For those who don't know, Fresher's Week is the first week or two weeks at university here in the UK. Lots of parties and events take place during the week or weeks, and lots of people end up meeting each other or forming relationships. I wish I could say that I either hate or love it, but I can't give a solid answer. On the one hand, meeting lots of new people and going to clubs and getting drunk for the first time in my life feels good, and takes away most of my sorrows and defensiveness. But on the other hand, things get much, much worse when I realise what is really going on in those events, and how much of a failure I am.There are lots of issues that I have so far, but one of the main ones is, you guessed it, virginity and girls. Many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during Fresher's week is the romance, or getting with someone. Whether it's a simple dance, making out, or actually bringing them back for a one night stand, many students have done something with either the opposite or the same sex, sometimes both, during this week or weeks, and that's one of the main causes of awkward situations when you meet that someone you ""did it with"".I hate it. I hate being a virgin, even as young as 18. I hate seeing all these girls and boys, whether they are already in a relationship or just met, making out with each other or even kissing once or twice. I hate having to make things awkward when I talk to girls, or things not going further than just a short conversation (though I fully respect consent and if they simply don't want to go any further). I hate having to constantly be on the defensive in case they have a boyfriend or guy with them who will attack anyone who so much as talks to them in a wrong way. I hate having to end up losing my friends to the crowd in the centre of the club which I learned the hard way I don't survive in. I hate so much more of what goes on there.But I can't leave it.I can't leave it because I know I will achieve nothing of the sorts should I try and seek out ways other than going to a nightclub. I'm not looking for a girlfriend at the moment. It's fresher's week for fuck's sake; you're not meant to be forming relationships already because they won't last (and please don't emphasise on this point; it's trivial). Every single night, every single minute of me being in there not being able to do what the other guys who got girls are doing is torture. It's the worst I have ever felt in my five years of wanting to get a girl, possibly the worst in my life. Me being suicidal at 11 was nothing compared to what I am and will be going through. At the moment I am at a complete loss. It's the end of the first of two weeks of Fresher's, and I still haven't made any progress. I've got drunk three times out of the five times I went out, and still no drunken making out or hooking up, though I know there are other ways to get with girls. Every time I ask someone for help, they are on repeat. Here are a few examples of what they say, and what I really, really want to reply.""You don't need to rush things b"" = Neither did the guys making out with the girls. I'm not rushing things because I want to, I'm rushing things because I have to. Because if I don't do so by the end of Fresher's, things will get a lot harder as I will have to balance lectures and activities with trying to get with a girl. ""Life is more than just losing your virginity/making out with a girl"" = I know that, and just so people know I know it's not going to fuck with my studies in any way. I won't let it. People have said that so many fucking times, it's not helping. Either offer some real advise or don't. The same can be said of a lot of things, yet people still worry about them.""There are lots of people who are still virgins/didn't make out with a girl"" = Still not helping. It's the same as saying to a depressed person ""lots of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives"". It's a subtle way of saying get over it, which in itself is REALLY not a helpful thing to say.""You'll end up with a lot of embarrassment/awkward situations"" = No. Hell to the no. The same people saying to those who got drunk and embarrassed themselves ""its alright b they wont even remember it when lectures start"" have the audacity to say this to me? There is nothing embarrassing or awkward about being able to say ""I lost my virginity during Fresher's week and it was great"" or ""I made out with her so hard last night"". If anything it will instil confidence. Nobody fucking understands. Nobody. Like drones, all they do is just repeat the same. Fucking. Useless. Advice.I am at my wits' end with this. It runs through my mind every fucking minute of the day. I'm not trying to set up a multinational company, become a multi millionaire, or anything that I know will take time and effort. All I'm looking to do is make out with a girl like all the other guys seem to effortlessly do, and end up taking one back to my place to fuck. Is that so much to fucking ask for? "
I know I deserve it,"Whenever I mess up I like to punish myself. Other than the obvious, like cutting, sometimes I don't eat for hours even though I'm hungry. My record is 22 hours, but I eventually caved because I almost fainted. Sometimes I force myself to walk home alone in the cold and rain because I don't deserve warmth or human company. When there's a voice saying that I deserve punishment for being a terrible person on repeat any time I'm suffering, it makes  the pain a lot easier to bear.Maybe one of these days that voice telling me I don't deserve to live will become loud enough that I'll actually have the balls to end it all. "
I don't know what I expected of tonight,Here's to everyone to have a better tomorrow :)Goodnight everyone. We are all important in life.
Was just diagnosed with PDD,"Does anyone have any advice for someone who had been trying his best to deal with long term depression, 10 years now, I can barely make myself be around people, even family seem faceless to me.I need some advice on how to deal with this in a healthy way, so far it's been me working two jobs so I don't have to make friends, and self medicating until I'm in Oblivion."
At the bottom of what I thought was bottomless,"My family is so far to the bottom of what I thought was a bottomless pit, I can no longer see light. It is a terrifying place to be. I'm tired if fighting just to survive, only to get kicked further down Every time I see even a glimmer of hope. That light turns out to be a train from hell Our family breakdown: I live with so many medical conditions, most days just getting to the couch is a major accomplishment. Somedays just the restroom. I need to remodel my bathtub so I can use it instead of my kids tint one which barely holds my bath chair. The way their bathroom is set up makes showering very hard, thus very unsafe for me. Mine needs to be completely redone sue to the handicap bar pulling out the drywall and most if the tiles, moisture got in, and now it has to be checked for mold.I need to make the house more wheelchair, handicapped,  and walker friendly as I just fall sometimes without notice. My legs just suddenly stop. I need handles on my walls and a ramp into the house. I also need to put in enough storage at the wall level that other than major furniture like couches, the house is clear for both myself and my husband. The garage as well to keep track if the crafting supplies and books I use to make extra money, and teach my kids.My husband has osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease. We sent him to the er last night for one thing and he came home after a ct scan with a diagnosis of a chronically broken pelvis. Now we know why he can barely walk, and why his back hurts all the time.My son is autistic, and homeschooling is the only way he thrives, but all our computers are 8 years old and can barely work. My daughter made one mistake in a teenage career that has otherwise been pretty much as perfect a teenager as can be, but it has left us without a vehicle and us in a bad place. I'm in a wheelchair, my husband should be, but you know, until I get a new electric, that I lost to vandalism, we are out if luck. My seizure cat had massive vet bills this year due to lupus complications and my son's emotional support cat got a bladder blockage, so it has been hard.There is so much more thatch have on my help site, but I am too tired to type it. I'm just exhausted both physically and mentally. I don't know how much longer we can can hold it together. If I didn't have to worry about the kids, I would end it now. "
One good day,That�۪s what I had yesterday. The first good day in a very very long time. Is that what I�۪m fighting for?? One day where I don�۪t hate myself. Is it worth staying alive for 1 good day a year?? I don�۪t think so and now I just don�۪t wanna be here.
I just want someone to talk to just a human i can freaking talk to and hug,im so alone i just need someone it hurts so so bad being without a someone for such a long period of time. plz help me
I'm about to run out of reasons to keep going.,"This week I just made a list of things that used to make me fell good and now prevent myself from ending my life, and I figured out that now I only have 1 motive to wake up in the morning and it isn't enough. I feel desperately lonely since 2012, when I moved into a new city and couldn't manage to make new friends, only the few ones that work with me (and, even though, they disappear as soon as I move to a new job). The only connection with my old life, friends and family was my ex-boyfriend, but our relationship was a mess. I don't even know if I really love him, like, ever. But we went along for 5 years. After my last birthday, in march, I just realized that he no long filled the emptiness in my heart and he doesn't even treated me like anybody was supposed to be treated by a loved one. Then we broke up.Now I have no family and no friends, my mom is the only one and we, like, hate each other. Playing videogames, watching movies or trying to pull myself into social situations doesn't seems to have any effect to relief the pain anymore.I tried talking to my ex again, but he doesn't want to talk to me anymore after the breakup. He was the only one able to keep the suicidal thoughts outta of my mind, and he used to have some kind of mental illness too, so we used to help each other. Now he's fine with his job, his new friends, his family that loves and supports him and I am no longer any relief to him, I ain't even a good memory, as he wants to erase me from his life at all costs. But he got his almost perfect life and I got nothing but nostalgic sadness.I feel empty and alone."
My cat died today. My best friend.,"Hey people. So as it says in title, I was fighting with depression for a few years now and I actually felt like I'm totally okay last few months. But today my cat died. My best friend, she would always wait by the door when I was about to arrive from work. She was always next to me when I was home, and now it's all so empty. I have trouble forming bonds. But the bond I formed with her was strong. I don't know how to keep on going. The worst thing is that I could be blamed for her death. I took her to vet because she lost weight. And she had some parasites that actually started a cancer in her body. Vet said that maybe she could have helped her if I'd brought her earlier. She always used to loose weight when she was in heat, so I tought that's why she lost some weight. But I was wrong and now she is dead. They had to put her to sleep forever. I can't stop thinking about how it would go if I took here to vet earlier. I only noticed she is getting worse a month ago. So since I'm living alone at 21 and paying for living and school while working I had to put some money together before going to vet's place. I can't stop blaming myself, and missing my little Tina. I always have this feeling that she is here. I look on my bed and see her, and a second later I realize it's just my imagination. She is gone. I love her so much, but I failed her. I really do hope she is at better place now. Waiting for me like she always used to when I was comming from work."
How does anyone make it?,"How the fuck do people afford college? How the fuck can people afford to live? Jesus fucking christ am I a goddamn idiot. I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to make it in this world. I don't know shit about shit, and I have no money. I have absolutely no fucking way to make nearly enough money to support myself. I have absolutely no way to pay for college or any other kind of schooling for that matter. I can only save 50 fucking dollars a month after all of the expenses I DO have such as car insurance, gas, food, medical bills, car maintenance  and my phone service. How in the fuck is life supposed to be enjoyable when it is utter shit? Can someone please fucking tell me how keeping on is better than jumping off of a fucking bridge? I CANNOT COPE.
Edit: Thank fucking God I have a home to stay in rent-free because otherwise I'd be in the fucking streets. Forgot to mention that part."
I think I�۪m almost there,"I�۪m really drunk, my friends have finally passed out. I have all the chemicals I�۪ve planned to use. Idk I guess I really wanted to talk before I did it, even if it�۪s anonymous.
I�۪m almost there. Just one moment of courage and I�۪m gone. "
Anyone feel this way,I don't have any reason to want die it is all just so pointless and none of it matters and we can't control ourselves anyone feel like life is pointless even though you aren't going through anything rough.
My (17/F) best friend (18/M) is depressed and suicidal and it's draining me,"It's going to be long. I'm sorry about that... so a little background: We've been friends for about 4 years with its ups and downs but in the end we still stick together. He has had a lot of problems in his life. Living in a poor family, sexual and verbal abuse from colleagues and death of his father to name the most important ones.Recently his girlfriend broke up with him to be with another guy from his class. (Obviously he now hates that guy.) He's had (undocumented but pretty much obvious) depression and suicidal thoughts before that but I think this has been a breaking point for him.After the breakup he's been telling me a lot more than usual about how he feels. Saying that he's never going to find anybody who will love him romantically. That he's given up on talking to new people because everyone who he meets ends up breaking his heart in some way. That he feels alone and basically lacks reason to live plus is overdrien with hatred for that guy.No matter how many times I try telling him that it's not true. That he has people (me and some other friends) who care about him, he doesn't listen to me and just keeps talking about all of this. There has even been instances where he would outwardly tell me his plans on killing himself and i had to talk him out of it.
He would also mention the guy that stole his girlfriend a lot. Talk about how much he hates him, describe how he wants to attack/kill him. Even mention that he's had a dream where he shots him with pleasure. They go to the same school/class so he even stopped attending it because he says he can't stand looking at him and seeing how happy he is.Now the reason I'm writing all of this is because I've tried helping him a lot of times but there's only so much that I can do. I told him that he should see a therapist but he doesn't want to. I try telling him that it's going to be okay and that I will stay with him but he doesn't believe it. He's questioned me a few times. Thinking that I don't actually care about him but I'm still working on proving him otherwise and I think it's slowly succeeding.
But I'll be honest and say that it's really draining me. The way he talks about all of his problems and I can't even help him in any way. Every single time he starts talking about this I feel guilty for not being able to do anything useful.
I'm starting to question this friendship because I love and care about him a lot (not in a romantic way) but the amount of sadness that I get from knowing how he feels just makes me want to stop talking to him sometimes.I realize it's probably selfish of me to say this but really... talking to him when he's like this has been very tiring. I feel like I can't do anything to help him anyway (after all i've tried) so I just end up reading about how he gives himself max 5 years of life because he says that after that he probably won't have the strenght to live anymore, and how he ""puts on a mask"" and pretends to be happy.
It feels like it's too much for me but maybe I'm just the wrong one because he's clearly sick and in a worse situation than me.
So I wanted to know: am I wrong for being tired of it? Should I still be friends with him if it brings me so much pain? I can't just leave him now because he would get even more depressed and suicidal so what should I do?He truly believes that there's no way he could ever feel better or find someone that will love him. He refuses to see a therapist because after his fathers death he doesn't want to ""give his mother any more reasons to worry""
I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you for any help.
(By the way I am not a native English speaker so I'd like to apologize if the text is chaotic or if there are any grammatical errors)TL;DR My best friend is depressed and suicidal, doesn't want to get help, I love him but it's physically and mentally draining me and I don't know what should I do."
Is this normal?,"Hey,These days I've been feeling down. At school I barely talk with friends (also since we are in different classes). I laugh at jokes, but as soon as I am alone, I start to think of how I get hurt. Example: When I stand at the bus stop, I imagine how I would jump infront of a car and get hit. There is something holding me back, and I am probably too scared to do it anyway. In the last hours, I started to push myself to do impulses things, like throwing my phone. I am signed up to do workout, but I'm not feeling like it. I lied to my parents, that I went to the gym even though I didn't, and now they don't talk to me and say what an asshole I am. Granted, I am rude to my parents sometimes, and now they keep talking what an unthankful asshole I am. These things might be right, but it brings me to another point: I get angry pretty quickly lately. It's not that I have some uncontrolled aggression disorder, idk. The point is, I imagine myself being hit and being in a coma/unconscious, but am too scared to be permanently dead. I've been thinking about going to a psychiatrist, but maybe this is something everyone goes through. Sorry if this is all ordered, it's just that I don't know anymore. Activities like programming or gamings aren't enjoyable anymore to me."
Growing up.,I didn't realise growing up meant dying inside but hey it's whatever.
No will left to live.,"I'm not sure why I'm posting here in the first place. Perhaps it feels somehow cathartic to let my feelings into the Internet without much consequence instead of try to explain them to those close to me and fail to do so. I'm so tired. Not my-feet-hurt-from-all-that-walking-and-I-need-to-sit-down-and-have-hot-cocoa tired, but so-fucking-overwhelmed-with-all-the-things-I-need-to-keep-up-with, so-fed-up-with-all-my-failures tired. Worked my ass off all my life, and still failed at life so monumentally with the wrong choices that it's almost comical. Graduated with a subpar GPA, living in a hellhole of a country where I feel like I'm drowning. Can't find a decent grad school with my profile, can't find a proper job abroad. I spend hours on end studying and applying, arrogantly ignoring the fact that I'm simply not good enough. I am just a massive failure.How have I come to this? Was that bright young girl only an illusion? How did I get so left behind? How did everything go so wrong?It's my birthday this Sunday. Forces me to take a good hard look at all that time that I've wasted. And at this point, there doesn't seem to be much to undo the damage. I wish I had the courage to kill myself. Tried many times, got pretty close on a couple occasions, but, obviously, never close enough. I'm not sure I could now, either. And that's the absolute worst. It's impossible to drag yourself out of bed in the morning when you know nothing you do that day is going to make a difference. You're still going to be the same loser you were the day before.Time's passing by, and each minute is yet another reminder of the life that I wasted. I feel unfathomable shame and guilt for not trying harder, but I have no more will to keep on. Can't keep up this freaking charade anymore.I don't think anyone will miss me after I'm gone. Mom will be glad to have one fewer person's whining to listen to, Dad won't give it much thought, and my brother might not even notice that I'm gone. Boyfriend will likely be relieved to have gotten rid of the burden that is me.Why couldn't one just disappear? Why does one have to try and deal with a live she's not equipped to deal with? Why does she need to have the scars left to remind her of that?"
Just A Thought,"Im currently in the final decision making stage. Ive always hated my life since i was 10. I was bullied at school for my stutter so i had no friends and still dont at this point in my life. But this summer was the best and worst summer of my life. For the first time i was happy i met a girl and she was everything i ever wanted but after a couple of weeks she had to move back to her country and that broke me. I started to not eat, not sleep and just wanted to be alone. That also caused my family to hate me. They wanted to help but id push them away. Now a month has passed by and i come to find out she has a boyfriend. The thoughts of suicide were strong before but now they are even stronger. For the past month ive had that feeling in my stomach of butterflies or wanting to vomit and i cant take it anymore. Ive cried almost every day and though im going to therapy the thought of suicide keeps growing stronger. I was meant to start my second year of university but i told them i need a year break because i cant get anything done. Ive stopped taking care of myself and i feel bad for my parents. Ive already written a letter to my whole family and my ex in case i were to pass away but i dont know what to do. Its a matter of weeks/months now i dont see myself going past 2018.I know this isnt as serious as others on this group. I just wanted to say that i know it feels shit but i pray to god that something good happens in the next fee weeks. I love you all and it makes me so sad seeing so many people with the thought of suicide every minute. It shouldnt be this way. I wish you all the best and i hope you give god a second chance and stay here with us a bit longer. Theres a reason why you havent done it and you need to keep on believing in yourself. Im trying my best."
Misery,I'm so constantly miserable. I don't want to breathe anymore. Nobody likes me and everyone always makes fun of me and how terrible at things I am. I try so hard to be happy. Maybe I'm not meant to be happy. I just want to die. I have no meaning and everybody hates me anyways. What's the point.. what do I have to look forward to...
Helping a Friend,How can I help a friend who is in another state and makes a threat of suicide? Who can I call for help?
i am panicking majorly,"I have about $7900 in debt, or so including medical debt. I am absolutely drowning in it now and i've tried so hard to make it work but I have basically no spending money and no way to afford my mental healthcare. I have constant panic attacks at work, I don't eat some days because I can't afford it. I can't afford to go to the doctor anymore. I can't afford to keep my teeth cleaned, they're almost always in pain from my poor dental healthcare as well. I am just wondering why I should continue suffering when I can't even dream of being happy for at least 3-5 years. What is the fucking point in being unhappy for 7+ years when things are so bleak. Why should I live. Why should I continue to struggle. All I feel is guilt and suffering and stress. I don't think I've been happy for so long I don't even remember what I feel like ""normally"". I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm so full of shame for the things I've done and my inability to cope. I hate myself and my life and everything. I just can't deal with this anymore. I'm buying a stout rope tonight and hanging myself or visiting the firing range nearby to rent a gun and blow my brains out at the range. I don't want to struggle and suffer anymore. This is undending torture for me. please understand.I have been thinking about ways to kill myself. I'm either going to go buy some strong rope from Home Depot after I get off or go to the nearby shooting range, rent a gun, and kill myself there, or I'm going to go jump off the building next to work, or I'm going to go home to my apartment and jump off the 3rd floor balcony, or I'm going to slit my wrists. I can't take this anymore god someone please help me how do I survive. How do I get $7900 together quickly how do I resolve my growing debt and neverending bills."
Living for someone else and not myself...,"I have wanted to kill myself every day for the last 3 years.The biggest issue I face is what pain my mother and spouse would suffer. My mother is already killing her liver in her attempts to understand and help my drug-addicted brother. My spouse lost 2 out of 3 of his siblings to car accidents and has a hard time cultivating a desire to live and enjoy life. If my parents, sibling, and spouse were removed from my life and the guilt were absent, I'd just do it already. But I effing can't.I hate this mundane existence. It's always ""try to find something you enjoy!"" or ""work on exercising and eating better!"" or some other strip of paper drawn from the pot of life-altering paths of action. But no matter what, we're still required to live in the illusion that we have a life while slaving away to make money just to survive. We, normal people, do not call the shots.I just got into a car accident last week. I pulled out from the stop sign intending to take a left turn which crosses two lanes of traffic (4-lane road) that have a straight shot with no stop sign or light. The car closest to the curb had its blinker on to turn onto my street. No cars were coming from the right. I entered the intersection and in no time at all, a motorcycle came flying around the turning car and hit my bumper, just an inch to the right of my driver's side headlight. His bike tore my bumper off, tore out all of my transmission and break lines and crushed my radiator. I was in so much shock - this is the first accident I've ever been in in my life. The police were nice and confirmed there were no life-threatening injuries, although he complained of painful ribs and was being taken to the hospital. Police Dept confirmed he is stable and all is well.The cop wrote me a careless driving ticket which is the equivalent of reckless driving in my state as far as drivers license points go anyway. Though this is supposed to mean the accident was not caused by intentional behavior, the man was still injured in the accident and I was ticketed as the at-fault driver, though he was clearly speeding and not visible behind the turning car before he sped around them. My life is the epitome of Murphy's Law right now. Our dog and two cats just got fleas two days ago. Last Saturday, I purchased an ""as is"" used car in desperation and am now indebted to the dealer $4300 despite problems it is having (no warranty).I have rheumatoid arthritis, so the pain I experience makes it really hard for me to do the things my SO would like to do to have fun. On Monday, he talked about taking a trip to Europe for a couple weeks to a month, but that he'd want to go with a friend or someone who can walk around with him and... I just feel like I've been given worthless body that only holds me and my loved ones back. I'm going to have a charge on my record indicating that I'm careless, even though I'm one of the most alert and safest drivers I know - to a point where my husband prefers to drive. I can't maintain social relationships anymore because I'm just not interested.I want to be dead. I want to be done. But I have to live for everyone else in my life, and that is killing me even more because none of them have to LIVE in my mind. Nobody has to live the advice they give me... So I just sit here and cry and feel hopeless. What is the point anymore?"
the only reason i am alive is because of a girl i like,I have been through some bad times and i have thought about killing myself but i haven't in hope of being with her
Almost there,Same
I don�۪t know what to do,"Every time at school there�۪s always someone talking about me behind my back or laughing at me. I make good grades and my family life is great but school has gotten to the point where I�۪m scared to go. I don�۪t want to study or talk to anyone anymore, just go home and lie down and stay there. I don�۪t know what to do. I�۪ve tried everything and it hasn�۪t helped. I have some friends but they never get made fun of or anything, it�۪s always just me."
I'm Done Running in Circles,"I'm sick and tired of all this supposed ""Help"" that I'm getting, it's been a whole year already and all that has happened is I've moved right back to where I started. I've had: Self Help Therapy = Nothing, Counselling = Nothing, CBT = Nothing and now I'm back with self help and the person isn't even a therapist! I always knew I was right all along and that nothing was going to help or make any difference to my mood or depression.Now I'm just stuck feeling empty and emotionless about everything and not caring, and all my friends have abandoned me (just like I knew they would). I get no enjoyment or happiness out of anything and everything I do only stops my depression for the period that I do them and when it ends it's back to depression.I have every reason to end my life but I still choose to suffer within it I don't even know why I do, only that getting the means to end it can be fairly difficult where I live. I don't see my lasting too much longer before I finally lose it, and frankly I don't really see posting here is going to make much of a difference either. But Meh."
I'm sad about how much i eat. Then i eat more.,"I'm to lazy to do anything about it. People tell me I'm still growing but im 16 now and nothing has changed. I feel like garbage. Nothing makes me feel happy other then music and my dog. Moved schools lost all my friends and let my self go. Want to just fucking blow my brains out. Im just a fat, anxiety filled wreck. How did you guys deal with this shit. Don't know how much more i can take of this."
My life is a disaster waiting to happen.,"tl;dr I hate college and I want to kill myself.I want to start off by saying that I am currently a struggling college student in my first year. I already dropped one of my classes because I was falling behind so much in that class. Now, I just want to drop out of college and give up, be homeless, and give up on my dreams of amounting to anything. It really pisses me off when people say I'm a smart person because they don't even consider the countless failures in my life and instead look at, ""oh he can solve a Rubik's cube he's a genius.""College is such a fucking scam that high schools brainwash you to get into and when you go in, they teach you all this stuff that isn't even relevant to your degree. After you become this person deeply invested in the opinions that college has, then they give you what you want. The educational system in the US is such a fucking disaster.I just want to give up and die alone on the streets, like my parents told me I would do if I didn't amount to their expectations. This massive amount of pressure has been put on me to be an A and B student in classes that have nothing to do with my degree, yet I need these classes if I want to amount to anything.This world has become so black and white and it is a miserable place to be. I wish suicide was as easy as pressing a button, but I'm too pussy to actually do anything like hang myself or jump off a building.Update: I�۪m just going to take a break from even stressing and recenter myself."
I want to get away from this self destructive attitude and I feel like I've tried everything.,"I've done some self destructive things. One of which being, not eating for 110 hours. I also constantly have destructive thoughts, like breaking a window and ramming a large shard into my thigh. These thoughts just appear,  even while I'm out. And I hate it. I'm sick of these thoughts and I don't know how to fix them. I am still get to physical injur myself, such as cutting, and I likely won't commit suicide. But I would love to know if anyone has an idea on how to turn it around. "
I can't help but feel worthless.,"I'm a 26 year old male living with his mom for financial reasons. She verbally and emotionally abused me all my life, saying I ruined her life and that she wished she aborted me, that I was useless and fucked up and barely a human being (due to my introversion and lack of affection for her). She was a drunk and let her boyfriends threaten to kill me when I defended her from them and would ask me to forgive them and give them another chance. I never felt like she actually wanted a child. I've never felt loved by her and I feel like I'm incapable of forgiving or loving her at this point. That being said, in recent years she's acknowledged her abuse and realized her part in my development of clinical depression. She's still very harsh towards me sometimes and always assumes the worst of me but it's nothing like it used to be. I can also stand up for myself a bit better and often prove how irrational she's being. Earlier today, I overheard her talking to her friends about how useless I am. It felt like in an instant I reverted back to my childhood and I felt sick. It's like all her development is fake. It upset me but I didn't think truly bothered me until I just found myself thinking ""I wish I was worth something."" I keep looking up suicide methods which I haven't done in years. I've attempted before so it scares me a bit that this isn't beyond my ability  The thing is, I objectively know I'm not really worthless. I have a college education, am a good writer, have a beautiful girlfriend that I love and amazing friends who value me. I'm capable of learning. The only issue right now is I have no idea what I'm doing with my life career wise. I don't have a job. I'm lost and I feel like I might not even be capable of a normal job because of severe social anxiety. The urge to just end it is growing stronger. I don't know how to convince myself that I don't deserve this. I don't know how to tell myself that my mom's words mean nothing and are bullshit. She's shaped me in so many ways, all of them negative, and I feel trapped. I feel like the only way to escape her is dying.I just need to find a way to convince myself otherwise. "
My inferiority complex towards my boyfriend gives me suicidal thoughts,"Cross-posted from  where it was deleted to avoid harmful trollsI've always had self esteem issues due to my abusive family and repeated school failures. I am feeling super inferior to everybody in general and I'm very anxious. Anyway, I've been with my boyfriend for a bit less than a year now. He's absolutely amazing on every aspect, he's the most caring I ever knew. He accepts all of my insecurities, listens to my worries and always does his best to reassure me, a real treasure. Besides that, he's confident, attractive, extrovert, popular, and a very talented musician - basically he has all the qualities I desire. I'm 4 years late in my studies, have no talent, suffer from anxiety and body image issues,... Many things that he never worries about. Every time he displays his musical or social talent, instead of feeling inspired by him, I get super jealous. I'm convinced that he's what I'm supposed to become and that I never will because I suck at everything and I'm a failure. Now I've reached a point where I can't even stand hanging out with him because I immediately start comparing him to me and it makes me feel suicidal. I feel like I'm never gonna be as good as him and that I should erase myself because I'm gonna be a failure forever. I know my behavior is unhealthy but I'm unable to see my boyfriend as my equal and it makes me more and more depressed each time. Please help, I don't know what to do. I'm very sorry about my bad English, it's not my mother tongue. Thank you for reading !!: boyfriend superior to me in every aspect, I feel inferior next to him and it drives me nuts. I know it's unhealthy but I don't know what to do "
Need friend,I need to keep my mind occupied.
About ready to throw it in.,I'm a young adult (22) and the thought of living on my own with no help of any kind is driving me towards suicide.I have no friends either as they all left or made there social circle smaller leaving me out.
Am going to die by the end of weekend,And the thing that hurts the most is that there is nothing I can do about it. Not when I've tried every trick in the book to stay alive. I really wish it didn't have to be this way. And now I get to prepare my final 2 days on earth
I feel so lost. Please help. I really could use a friend.,"I usually am on here (different username and would rather not share) helping others to get back from the brink. Tonight I am feeling really low to the point of suicidal. I am overwhelmed by a number of different factors. And each one would make me seem like an ingrate. I am not. I really don't want to die. I don't want to give into these feelings....they scare me. I really dont think I would actually do anything to hurt myself but the feelings are there on occasion. Tonight has been bad. I am worried about my cat that is sick (potential flea infestation on top of it all). (Which makes me feel like a horrible pet owner and I love my two cats to death- not literally dont worry!) I am also very worried about my husband who I got sick because I was sick (seasonal cold). I am still trying to recover myself. I know that probably has made it harder to get out of this negative thought process I tend to get myself into sometimes late at night when I can't sleep. I haven't slept at all tonight; I have been obsessing on things that are out of my control at the moment and it sucks! Like I said I won't hurt myself. I am just having a very bad night. Even so, I am posting here as a ""reality check"" to myself. I really need someone to talk to. I dont have a new therapist yet. I have a great husband who really helps me a lot and works very hard and I just feel like I am a lazy burden who is keeping him from having the life he really wants but he says that's not true. I wish things could be easier. I am sorry for rambling I just had to get this out somewhere. "
Again...,"I want to die. Again, It�۪s always again. I don�۪t care. I don�۪t want to get better; I want to curl up in a ball and die. Nothing traumatic has occurred, and I have friends and family that would probably support me through this, but they don�۪t know how I feel because I don�۪t want them to support someone that doesn�۪t want to change. I have allowed the depression to become comfortable because it stays unlike my fleeting states of random happiness. The thought of suicide crosses my mind more than it probably should, but those thoughts have become comfortable too. I think I�۪ll eventually do it one day, maybe not soon, but I think I�۪ll do it. Recently I�۪ve come to the conclusion that I should die painfully because my life is great, and I shouldn�۪t be in this much mental discomfort, so I�۪ll die painfully as a last way of letting myself know that I am worthless, and I deserve to be in pain for not seeking help or being able to fully take advantage of my life. "
Goodnight everyone!,"I've decided tonight is the night I die. I'm going to take a bunch of pills a slit my wrists as backup. I'll let you guys know if it doesn't work out, thanks for everyone's support.  "
I want to use suicide as a means of getting my father to listen,"Now, here's the context:My father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger. Aunt found out, told my mother, i dug deeper and found some other things as well. Happened 2 months ago, parents still have huge fights everyday. Now, back then, i loved my father. He's a very hard worker, working from 10 am up to 1-2 am with no breaks. And he still found time to spend with us on weekends. But after we found out, he changed. Bad. He began being cold, ruthless. I already blamed myself for all those fights (since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger), but he threw even more shit at me. Started shouting at me. Everything i did was wrong. Restricted me from the internet and going out with friends. I have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take it.Before the fights, i was depressed but now i'm depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. I can't bear this anymore. He won't listen when i plead, he won't listen when i scream, he won't listen when i reason, maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me."
Today is the day,"While I realise most of my problems are temporary, The pain I go through daily is not.
I really can't handle it anymore, life just isn't worth it for me."
It's okay..you are lucky,"It's okay when your father didn't understand you , at least he still talks to you. Its okay when your mom doesn't make sense, at least she is there for you. You are so lucky to have an angry big brother, atleast he cares for you. Its okay when your sister dont listen to you, she still loves you.How lucky you are when ur friend calls you for meetup. How lucky you are when you have hundreds of kith and kins in your contacts. You don't know how it feels in eternity when they hate you. You dont know how betrayed you feel when the so calls friends forever dont even reply yiu. You wont understand the cruelty this cosmic laws plays with you. You are so lucky they understand s you. You don't know how it kills you when they dont even want to see this scums face. He did what he thought was right but he can't explain it to them. They thought he dont need parenting anymore. He wanted to tell the reason but it was too late. He tried to open up with his so called friends from childhood, but he was unaware of the facts that he never had those friends. He tried to leave everything behind but he can't, Cuz he loved them a lot, he still cares. You are so lucky you dont care anymore but he isn't. He scrolls through infinite list of contacts in his Smartphone but he wasn't smart enough to understand he is not a friend, he was a puppet.Its okay when they don't sound pleasant, you can still listen to them until its too late. He tried his best for others but he lost his soul somewhere.You are so lucky and you wake up every morning with a good morning message, he wakes up thinking to get a small peek of his dearest people. I don't want you to suffer what I am  suffering. Spend sometime with your family when you are still lucky.,..."
I want to kill myself,"I feel so fucking bad, I just want to end it. I'm depressed and nobody really cares. Just.. I want to die."
Near the end,I know im nearing the end. I can handle anything right now and i know its only a matter of time before i go. I know what im gonna do and where im gonna do it. Im gonna make everyone hate me first. that way they wont care when i go. I dont want anyone living with the guilt that my friends have left me with. the what if i would have tried more. If i make everyone hate me then i can slip away in peace. My time is almost up.
"I'm going to do it, I need advice on how to leave things when I go,","I'm not asking for advice on how to do it, I just need advice on what to do before I do it, like should I write a will?, what should I write on said will? what type of place should I do it? should I contact anyone before I do it so my body is found? that type stuff."
i feel so empty right now,"both my gf and i have always suffered with mental health issues, and we've always been there for each other for the past year we've been together. recently however she decided to go to a therapeutic school for what could be either just a few months or even a year and as a result our communication has severely lessened. she said she was getting sick of her mental illnesses getting in the way of her life for so long and wants to do her best now to manage them so that when she is out she would be a lot more stable and healthy and that would make our relationship even better.i haven't talked to her in a week and it won't be awhile before i do as she has to work her way up to earn more privileges such as leaving the school or using the phone and such. and it's been really hard without her. i know how unhealthy it is to be so dependent on another, but yet it's so hard to change. and i know i should be happy that she is doing what she can to better her life for her and everyone around her, and i am happy for her, and i'm excited to see how she will be as time passes, but i can't help but feel so empty without her.she was my motivation for everything. i'd get up in the morning so i could say good morning and talk with her before she goes to school/work, now i wake up at 4 pm after being asleep for over 10 hours. etc etc i don't feel like writing more examples/i realize how petty this is. i'm mad that i'm like this but there's no energy to change it. i've been on the verge of crying for days now but i just don't want to cry, because i know once i start crying it won't stop. i've just felt and done nothing for so long of my life. to have her enter my life changed everything and now that she's gone for awhile i don't know what to do. it's been so long since i've been alone that i don't know what to do with myself. i don't have a purpose for myself. i don't really know what to ask of people here, i just needed somewhere to vent.edit: i've realized that i probably should've posted this in  as i didn't really mention suicide at all here. sorry about that. i do feel suicidal, but i don't think i'd do it because i know how horrible it would be for my gf to be away for awhile trying to get help and hear that i killed myself while she was gone. i'm sure she would even blame herself for it, and i wouldn't want that."
No matter how much you hate me you can never hate me more than i hate myself,Damn I thought I was original with this saying
What happens if I tell my GP that I have a plan,"I have a plan but I'm unlikely to carry it out, I'm 17 and live with my parents. Will they find out? UK."
There must be something wrong with me and not the world so the only solution seems to be to kill me. It�۪s simple,That's not true. The world is a messed up place! While their may be something wrong like depression it doesn't mean we are flawed!
"Tied a noose and hung it up. I knew I wasn�۪t going to do it because I brought my keys with me. I�۪m a failure, even at suicide.","I don�۪t know what else to say. Like so many others here, I feel like I have no reason to be depressed, yet I am. It�۪s a constant feeling that will never, ever go away no matter how hard I try. It�۪s genetic, it�۪s nature, it�۪s biological. Whatever the reading, it�۪s here to stay. I want to kill myself so badly. But for some reason, all I can think of is how I will let people down. And that just makes me sadder. I feel like I exist only for other people. There�۪s no other reason for me to exist. In fact, if I didn�۪t exist, i would care because I would be nothing. I�۪m not sure what help this sub can bring me, but I�۪m alone at home right now and I guess this is better than nothing. "
Think I'm done by now.,"It's just the same everyday. Work work work. Got no education whatsoever, I get kicked out of every school I go to. What is the point if all I have is beer and football? Skipped my girlfriend to watch football, so we broke up. Yeah. I'm in pain everyday. All I want to do is fight, I seriously think I got no future ahead of me. This weekend I'm home alone. Not even sure if I'm going to work anymore. Really thinking about just doing it. Why not? There is nothing to lose anymore man.. "
Just tied a noose and wrote a note. Now having second thoughts.,Im having second thoughts even though I was %100 sure before. Now i dont feel I need to talk to any body even though im probably going to feel the same way soon. whats up with that
Is there anyone that could talk to me? Just like be my friend even if it's only for a few minutes? Please.,I just want to talk to someone that will care. I'm 16 if age matters.
Can I talk to someone?,Not someone from a suicide hotline please.  I don't need effing police on my front doorstep.  I just really need to talk before I go any further.
"I can't handle this...""just one reason"" isnt enough any more. help me.","I used to be able to tell myself one reason was enoughmy wife was enoughbut I was wrong.She works so hard to take care of me (I am disabled, but not enough to get disability despite being every definition of non-functional). She loves me, but I don't know why. It scares me. My own parents never loved me or wanted me. She's the only one who cares. I don't deserve it. I feel like I'm in the way of her life and her happiness. If she had a semi-functional significant other she would be so much happier and in a better place financially/emotionally. All I do is drag her down. Shes become so depressed lately because she can't save me/fix me/cure me.I'm tired of this limbo. I'm so tired. Every moment I am awake, every breath hurts physically because of my sickness. There is no cure, no one cares to find one, and I'm not even able to manage the ""severe chronic pain"" side effect without getting treated like shit (but there's no way to explain that you're suicidal because you can't get pain medication without sounding like a drug addict, even with multiple chronic pain-causing diagnosiss, diagnosi, whatever).Make it stop. I don't even know what I need. I just need it to stop hurting this way."
"I don't want to live, but I don't want to die. Does anyone else feel this way?","me too! death is an incredibly scary unknown, but life is a very sad reality. sleep is a great intermediary state. but very few of us have the privilege of being able to sleep all of the time. "
never thought'd i would be posting this,"throughout my whole time having depression i have never been so close to just ending it all, it wouldn't be easy and i don't really have a method or anything but god i think about it daily now. last night i actually had the courage too and i just don't know how. feels like my life is on a constant downward spiral and i can't seem to pull myself out of it, when i think i've gone through the worst thing ever life just tops it. yes i have people and yes i matter to some people and it would suck knowing i hurt them but it's so fucking hard to keep living a miserable life. i can't do anything right and it may get better but that doesn't erase all of the bad shit and some things you just can't come back from. i don't know how much longer i can take this dude i feel like i'm going insane  "
I'm disappointing,"My whole life I was told I'm so smart and that I can do anything I put my mind to. I was held to a higher expectation because I excelled in many areas. But I just took that for granted and thought I didn't need to do any work for what I wanted because it was easy and I thought I would do it eventually. Now I have let everyone down. My parents, my boyfriend, my teachers, and friends. I don't put forth effort and when I do its too late. I feel terrible. Although nobody has said anything I still know and can sense I'm a disappointment. I feel like my life is worthless and I have no reason to be here. Maybe I should just give up. I've already messed up enough."
Is there a reason why I'm always left out?,Nevermind. Another unnecessary post that didn't really belong here
I want to tell myself positive things but it's so hard,"I don't know why, but I'll catch myself saying negative things to myself all the time. Mainly related to a small thing from almost a year ago (a short highschool relationship breakup 10 months ago).As advised, I'll try to stop myself from telling myself negative things. If I catch myself telling myself I'm a piece of shit for the 100th time, I'll tell myself to stop. But I can never get to the point of telling myself I'm good, or just even an ok. I go back to telling myself I'm shit for whatever reason just moments later.I'm tired of feeling this way about a problem that's so minor compared to anything else real people have to deal with. I was happy before and now I feel isolated and a burden to everyone.I have friends and a hobbies and this and that, nothing seems wrong from the outside. Maybe I'm just hyper-inflating this problem from the inside to make it feel like a much bigger thing.Maybe this is more of a  post but I hate that I'm even scared of looking at her general direction, when I have to see her everyday. It's so fucking pathetic, when all she thinks of me is a friend.I'll sometimes talk to her bestfriend and get help from her late at night but realize I'm probably ruining the friendship between me and ex's bestfriend, and try to curve it to be a happy ending, like ""I'm moving on, thanks again"" or ""I think this is working"". I don't like lying to her but I don't want to be annoying to her. I told her tonight let's not talk about my ex anymore so I don't annoy her and ruin our friendship.Anyways this and that, the tldr is I feel lonely and pathetic for inflating my problems to be much bigger than they are. I won't kill myself but I sometimes wish something would kill me. Or I would consider how to kill myself and how better everything and everyone would be after I'm gone. Maybe I'm just an edgy teen full of weird chemicals, but I don't know if this is a real problem or not."
"Washed up, post op tranny, circling the drain","I am a 19 (20 in a few days) year old transgender man (makes me sick to say it but I have long since completely disowned my""self""). I have been on hormone replacement therapy since I was newly 14, had a botched chest surgery exactly a year ago today. I'm just sick of being this. I can't motivate myself to be anything ""good"" or do anything at all because I don't want to be remembered as this fucking degenerate freak. That's what trans people are. We are just a sign of the end times. I know I was born like this, I just wish I was never born. Maybe it was radiation or chemtrails that caused this before birth, coulda been anything, who knows. Lol. I'm joking with you a bit but I'm also 100% serious. I don't want to be fucking trans, I don't care how the world sees me and I know it's a mixture of really good, neutral, and hateful perceptions, idc it's hard to explain. I don't want to be remembered. I rue that I ever existed (in this way). No matter what the cause of this is, it is so incredibly shameful and confusing. I've wanted to die off and on my entire life, but now I really have seen that this suffering is unnecessary, it leads to nothing good. There is no joy or anything other than intrusive violent thoughts for me in life. I just can't wait to die! Got a gun on the way.
P.S.
huddling together a million freezing cold, mentally ill individuals won't serve to keep me warm. Don't redirect me toward the trans community under the false pretense of self help, comfort, anything. "
"Afraid of death, but feel it could be release","I'm so afraid of death. It's a legitimate fear. However, they always say you should face your fears and I don't know how to face this one, short of being in control of when I die. I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but it almost seems pointless to live for me. I don't feel I've had any release, ever. I've always been in a fight or flight state and I don't know what to do anymore. Im so scared of death, but it feels like it's the only thing that could help right now. "
I can't anymore,"I've dealt with depression, I've dealt with rejection, I've dealt with failure. All I feel is that I'm never good enough and never will be. I don't want to go on. My ex and I, we were together for so many years. And he's moved on, while I'm still crying every day. He'll even be a father within a few weeks. I was never good enough to have his children, he never wanted them. Turns out he never wanted them WITH ME. He loves his new life. Living together, expecting a child. And all I have is myself. Nobody that loves me and nobody to love. He's always on my mind. She gets everything. He gets everything. I get nothing. I'm so done. I'm just done. I really don't want to live anymore. There is so much stress on me and going on around me. I'm so fucking done.Once that baby'll be born, I'm gone. "
Please someone help me I can't take it,Please someone stop me I'm young im decent at art I suppose I have a boyfriend who loves me but my emotions I can't stop them I'm going crazy I stopped myself before because I asked for help here but everything is becoming stressful I just want to relax and sleep why do I feel like I need to end it all? I'm going crazy SOMEONE HELP ME
I fucking hate my birthday,"Why did I have to come into existence in the first place? I fucking hate today so much. All it does is remind me every year about how many people don't care about me, how I'm another year closer to dying anyway, and how many life milestones I am no closer to reaching. I am so fucking tired all I can do right now is cry because I keep trying to get better and do better but it always amounts to nothing. Nothing changes for the better and I don't know how I'm supposed to ""just keep going"" anymore. I'm too old for this shit."
I'm afraid of getting old and want to die before that happens.,"It's so weird that as a teen I tried to kill myself because my life sucked. But now I'm in my mid 30s and my life is awesome except for one thing, that I'm getting old. I am panicking about this and can't stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore. I just started getting gray hairs and its FREAKING me out! I'm not ready to grow old and go through everything that comes along with it. I know this is a stupid reason for being suicidal and it's selfish of me, but I am too scared to get any older. I cannot stand the thought of getting one more gray hair. And wrinkles and all that other fun stuff. I just can't do it, I can't live knowing that I'm starting to rapidly age and am getting old. It's time to end my life, but I really don't want to. Can someone please help me. I need someone to talk to. I told my husband how I'm feeling and he doesn't seem to care, he won't answer my texts so now I feel all alone and really need someone to talk me out of this before I go to the highway in front of my house and jump over the barrier onto coming traffic. "
I like to think I feel normal but then I'm not.,"Killing myself goes through my mind a lot.  I used to think it was normal and that everyone has these thoughts and theres nothing to worry about. It's been getting more and more frequent of coming to mind. For the past couple months, it feels like there has not been one day that goes by without the thought of ending myself. It scares me because I feel I'm becoming more accepting and/or prone to do it. I'm becoming less afraid to die. Today, I got hit the scariest rush of just wanting to do it. It had never felt so strong in my life before. I'm scared that it's going to get worse."
I think this is it,"I just finished my note to my husband..Im scared to die but I see no other solution. I am pathetic and my life is a mess. I feel ashamed for being me. I have noone except husband and he would be so much better without me. I cant get help, noone can help me and I can no longer help myself. For 20 years I have hanged in there hoping for life to be better, and yes some days life felt livable, but this last year my life has come crumbeling down on me and the only solution is to end it. It would be so muchbetter for my husband in the long run, my depth will die with me, my pathetic beeing will be gone. All my life I heard how strong I am, but im not I am fucking weak. I have nothing. Even my parents could not live for me so why should I ? Yes both my parents commited suicide, so did my uncle, three other friends and my best friend. And then I brought all this problems on myself by being a useless piece of shit. Im so sick now I cant work or anything, I hardly ever sleep or eat. My life is hopeless and I bring nothing good to the table, just being alive is not enough...I wish I could live, but I cant. I see no light in the tunnel, I feel shameful for bringing myself to all this depth and now when I cant work everything comes tumbeling down on me. I hate myself, I hate to feel this way. I am not strong I am weak as hell. "
"So, I kinda went to look at guns today.","So I'm probably going to be fired next week because my work has been garbage. This is just the cherry on top of a lot of garbage making me think continuing to deal with depression and severe anxiety like I have been for the past five years (and my entire life basically). Now, I'm busting my ass to try and make sure I don't lose the job, but I kinda hate it anyways, and this is the second time this has happened where I am really close to being fired. I guess I kinda came out of it while at the Army Navy store, but goddamn. Like, I was at that point like you read where suicidal folks get happy thinking they are finally at that point where it's gonna end. I guess part of it was deciding I didn't have enough experience with guns and needed to research it more or practice with one before I know it'll be lethal. Like, it's still a very real possibility of happening, me buying one. My state has no waiting period and I have enough money at the moment to buy one. I'm not sure what I thought I'd get out of posting this. I guess I needed to vent I'm trying to schedule an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow or Monday, but fucking hell. "
I did a mistake,"Ok so today at work a few co workers brought up suicide and joked about it a bit and I was in but then I started to casually explain the best ways to kill oneself and how I would do it (I'm 21 and I have a very detailed plan for killing myself when I'm 30 and life doesn't change to the better) and one of them said ""Seems like you thought about that a lot."" and I didn't know what to say and just went silent, everyone looked at me in a weird way and I awkwardly tried to change the topic.Pretty scared that they'll tell this to our boss or other co-workers.Any of you ever had a ""slip up"" like that?"
It would not matter if I died 10 months ago,"I had some good times indeed, but the times when I was at peace were very rare, and I think I would not be missing out on anything had I died. The thought of unconsciousness and void is still alluring. It actually made me welcoming of death and not scared of it. I already have an idea how to end it though, had quite some time to think about that. I don't want this, it's that simple"
I think I'm done...,I basically mauled my academic career in about 3 days and don't have the energy to put that or myself back together... I've fallen apart so many times already and dying just sounds nice tbh.
"Everything I do, leads to suicide",Delete
I don't know what to say really,"I guess I just want to get this off my chest and see if someone can give me a reason to go on. This post might sound like bullshit or exaggerated, but it's all true. I don't think there's any way I could prove this stuff though.I was born with Aspergers, OCD and Depression. I've wanted to die for one reason or another every day of my life as far back as I can remember (I almost attempted suicide when I was six).My family hates me. Both of my sisters would routinely bully me to the point of me wanting to die when I used to live at home. My mom and dad like to treat my problems as a joke and laugh at me for being ""retarded"" or ""too much of a little bitch to get laid"". I would be physically abused (chocked, beaten, head slammed into a wall) and had my problems laughed at (I remember being so sick I could barely stand and being told to stop ruining their nature walk). I was also molested by a neighbor. I told my parents, they either didn't believe me or didn't care, and he's been over to our house many times for holidays, events or dinners ever since.The only thing I ever really enjoyed was video games but my mom refused to even consider letting me have any (even if I bought them with my own money no less!). She said I needed to spend all my time studying so I could get scholarships to college (and I was ten when this started). Congrats to me, I got a bunch of scholarships to a college I didn't want to go to, and now spend my days in college (year five) so busy I barely have time to do anything besides study. And it's all for a degree for a job that I hate so much I would rather die than have to do every day.I have almost no friends, and the few I do are usually too busy to ever talk to me. I usually talk to them once a week at best.I have no money, no social life, no romantic interest (I'm an asexual, sex disgusts me and so does romance), barely any friends and a family that hates me. I can look forward to a life of working a job I don't want to work until I get old enough to retire, retiring to an empty house with no friends or family, and then slowly watching myself get old and then die with no one around who loves or even cares about me. "
Had my first thought today,"I haven't been diagnosed but I'm probably depressed. My emotions mostly feel like trying to see through waxpaper, but lately I've been see-sawing very badly. I whiplashed today and almost quit my gym workout. I got a wave of self consciousness and defeatism before I left my house, pissed off at my appearance not being what I want it to be and having no control or recourse. Not obesity or anything, but just genetic traits. I get angry I can't achieve the appearance I want without a ton of effort, I can't imagine how it is for women to feel something like that daily. I will certainly never downplay their self consciousness ever. I think I have a narcissistic streak that kicks in as a defense mechanism from accepting that I'm a total failure piece of trash (I know that I am not, but facts don't matter when feelings are involved). As soon as I got out of the shower after work, I looked at myself, trudged through my routine and felt totally drowned in hopelessness.Then I felt physically nauseous & weak, and had a suicidal thought on a treadmill. I have no idea what happened, but I finished my workout and I seem to be ok now. I had a couple friends from years ago show up (as they do regularly) so I sort of had to snap out of it. For some reason I wanted to explore the idea, I visualized doing it with a gun in my room. I won't go into the details not just because the rules say not to, but I wasn't really interested in the effect on me. For some reason my mind was immediately picturing my parents hearing a loud bang and feeling their gut drop through the floor at the suspicion of what I did, then rushing over to finally see it. It was less a taunt for me to do it but something my mind wouldn't let me get away with without going all the way. It was a morbid curiosity that spawned from an intense wave of raw self loathing. It's so odd because I was generally  30 minutes before this happened.I think I just can't accept that I won't be what I see in my mind, I don't get the attention I feel I ""deserve."" I  ignored and I don't know what to do. My life feels incomplete. I don't know how to get to stage 2, I'm surviving but I'm not ""living"", and don't feel in control enough to adequately improve my life. But I SHOULD be in control, I'm an adult, I'm a  who is trying to be in the top 10%. I look in the mirror and see 2 people depending on my mood balance. I see a somewhat handsome man ready to take on the world, and other times a man who is deluded, afraid, and hiding - and the world by not giving me any attention is feeding the latter self image."
I don't really know anymore,"I don't really know what I'm doing here but I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm a 20, almost 21 year old University student in England, in my normal life I'm outgoing, fairly confident and happy. As with most students, and where I am from I go drinking a fair amount. Right now I'm drunk, it's 4am and I've just gotten home, and to be honest I want to die. I get like this a lot when I have been drinking and sometimes when I'm not and I don't know what's going on. I feel incredibly lonely like I have no one to talk to and honestly it makes me not want to exist. I always present myself as being strong and self assured however when I get like this I just weep uncontrollably and don't want to be here.I honestly don't know what to do, I have no one to talk to, I hate admitting I'm sad but at this point I have no choice. I'm told I have a lot to live for but at this rate I don't know wether I can reach my 21st. I don't have anything to continue for right now. I hope someone is here."
Ugh,It's so hard to find treatment options in my state I really give up
Fear and pain.,"... I can't do this anymore.In a way, I knew exactly how this would all end. I'm tired of bullshit answers, sorry - can't help you/nothing we can do, and reaching out to get absolutely nothing.I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of being sick. I'm tired of being stupid. I'm tired of my mistakes, I'm tired of my past, I'm tired of nothing getting better. I know maybe this feeling right now is a result of my poor choices, but isn't everything? All of this is unsurmountable - none of this is fixable. I survived so much more than this previously, and that's one of the cliche bullshit lines those trying to 'help' have suggested, but there's no way to make it out of this one. I should go out on the porch, so I don't mess up my clean house."
Feels like I�۪m hanging by a thread,"All I think about is death and pain. I feel pain. I want others to feel pain. My pain. I want them to experience what I have experienced. Why should I feel this pain alone? Why keep it all to myself? I want to share it. I hope they feel it when I go. I want to go now. I want to go but I see no way out. I�۪m trapped. I�۪m trapped in my head all day. Death and pain. Why am I alive? What is the fucking point of anything?My head is going to fucking burst. I cannot take this. I do not want this. Haven�۪t I suffered enough?I wish someone shared their love. A little bit. Even a tiny bit. With me. I want that, but I do not deserve it. I am left alone. Why? Am I so repulsive? Disgusting? Pathetic? Lazy? Life seems like a bad dream. A nightmare. This is as good as it gets? Fuck this. Fuck everyone."
Tonight is the same,"Hi. Thank you for reading this. I am not going to die tonight but I want to. Oh how I want to. I just need to get my thought out to someone so thank you for taking a piece of your life to read mine.I'm 27. I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Haven't tried since. Haha 10 years clean.Shit sucks. You keep telling yourself things get better but you know every day that it's a lie.For the past 6 years I have been living to take care of my grandfather and mother. I have no job because it's a full time job taking care of them. In my spare time I do home repairs on both houses, I'm pretty good at it and basically done everything from flooring to whole bathroom remodels. I also built my own house with my bare hands, only 1200 sq ft but it's my dream home.My mother is suicidal and my grandfather is about to die. Every morning I wake up and go check on him and you have no idea how it makes me smile to see him.My father got arrested for child pornography a couple months ago so I'm the only thing my mother has now.I'm not dumb. I have two college degrees but I feel like a failure. I try.I sit here and think ""what's next?"". I have everything I want in life but I'm terrified of losing everything. I'm not sad, I'm not wanting more, I'm perfectly content. It is what scares me.I've been looking for a girlfriend for 8 years, haven't found one yet because I never go out and even though I don't think I'm ugly I can't find anyone using Tinder. I've tried other dating apps but nothing.I have no money to my name and any money I do have goes to my mother and grandfather. I do odd jobs for people like fixing home plumbing or remodels. Guess you can call that a job but I don't make that much to require to send in a Tax return.The only thing I think I'm missing is someone to give my love to. It's all I've ever wanted. There was this girl that I have liked for 10+ years but I think tonight is the night I finally lay that to rest, long story. My whole love life is a long story. My other last crush, that I knew just as long, got raped and wanted to stop talking to me. That was over a year ago. She's with someone now and I'm actually happy for her.Life doesn't get better. Sorry this is such a poorly written post. So much to say but I don't care to write.Everyone is special. You are special :)"
Why I have depression and what it makes me feel like,"I'm 26 years old. I'll be 27 in October. I've suffered with depression for most of my teenage years and all the way up to now, I'll have it for the rest of my life. It's not something that can be cured only managed with a daily dose of medication that some days doesn't feel like it works. I was bullied all throughout secondary school from roughly the ages of 12 to 16. It was an unpleasant time in my life. There were a few people I hung around with and spoke to, but I still felt like I had no friends within school. My best friend went to a different school. He was the only real friend I had outside of it. I saw him nearly every day. But I still felt like an outsider within my group of friends and even my own family. I felt alone. During school I was called names, slammed into lockers, tackled to the floor and pinned down, I even had a brick thrown at my head once by one of my oldest ''friends''. The sad part is even though I was angry and hurt by what happened, I couldn't bring myself to walk away from them because I didn't want to be alone. I wasn't very smart. I did poorly in my GCSE's. After leaving school I took an ICT course in college because I had aspirations to become a video game developer, but I dropped out after a month because I knew it would take more than an active imagination to become a developer. It would take brains and I was severely lacking in that department.So after dropping out I ended up living at home, jobless, playing my Xbox all day and doing very little else. I'd borrow money that I had no intention of paying back off my parents and grandparents. I feel guilty about that. Honestly I was always quite lazy, I never really wanted to work, but a part of that came from lack of confidence and rejection. Because I was bullied in school I had very little confidence in myself. I was always doubting myself. I'm not smart, I'm not good-looking, I'll never amount to anything. And I didn't like being rejected. It made me feel worthless. Especially when I went to interviews and they said ''you don't have much experience do you?''. My reaction was always ''how am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me?''. No one seemed to understand that. I had a few small jobs that lasted a few days each, but I always ended up being a jobless bum. Then one day my grandad got me a job with him growing Christmas trees. Best job I ever had. I loved it. I worked there for maybe two years. I enjoyed the work, the money was great, but it was only a temp job and I knew that going in.One day my grandad asked me to drive the tractor up and down the yard whilst our boss was on holiday, so I could get used to it. He wanted me to reverse it back up the yard. I did and almost crashed into the shed. He lost his temper and yelled at me. Basically called me useless. I felt so low that I sat in the truck for the rest of day and cried. He was right. I am useless. In November 2015 I met my ex-fiancee, Amy. She was my first girlfriend because I never had the confidence to approach a girl and ask her out. I was a virgin until I was 24. I felt so special when Amy agreed to go out with me. I felt even more special when she said yes to marrying me two months later. Life was great for a long time. Then in March 2016 my job growing Christmas trees came to an end and I was so scared that I wouldn't find another. Luckily Amy helped me and I had a cleaning job within the week. Life was great again.And then something happened. I finally admitted that I had depression and that's when things went wrong. I started taking anti-depressants, but I foolishly stopped taking them because I felt like I was getting better and that's when I started treating Amy poorly. I was nasty to her. I hit her. Eventually I lost my cleaning job and life went extremely downhill from that point onwards. I became more nasty and cruel. I was snapping at her more often. I hit her more often. She didn't know who she'd get next. Jekyll or Hyde. Jekyll was the man she fell in love with. Sweet, kind, caring, loving. The man who helped her get out of debt that her ex-boyfriend left her in a week after we met. The man who bought her an Xbox One as her first Christmas present. The man who treat her like the princess she was. Hyde was the man she scared of. Cruel, physically abusive, nasty. A man who didn't realise what he was doing until it was too late. Who didn't care about the damage he was causing. In short he was an asshole. But that wasn't the real me. The real me was the man who would hold her as she cried herself to sleep. Who would sit on the sofa crying after trying to follow her when her mum upset her only to be told to leave her alone. Who made her laugh at his stupid jokes. Who would help her with money whenever she needed it. In short he was the man she fell for. Two months ago she left because she'd had enough of the abuse and I can't really blame her for that. I'm angry at myself for letting it get this far and for being such a stubborn idiot. I never meant to hurt her. I never meant to cause her so much pain.Now I'm alone again, I'm jobless again because I quit and I'm in so much pain myself because I'm my own worst enemy. All I ever wanted was to get married, have a family I can be proud of and have a job I like so I can provide for them. I wanted a son who grows up to be a better man than his father and a daughter who grows up to be exactly like her mother. I have friends and family who say they care about me but I'm not entirely convinced they do. If they did my three best friends would have invited me to visit New York next year. If they did my family would invite me around for a meal one night. The little things. Maybe I don't want them to care, so it would be easier for me to do what I feel I have to do in order to make this pain go away. I've tried to commit suicide three times in the past two months. I tried to overdose three times and failed each time. I've cut myself too. During those times I tried to kill myself I was acting irrationally because she refused to talk to me. After a month of no contact she decided to contact me out of the blue and brought all these old feelings back, then she decided to ignore me, making me feel a hundred times worse because now I knew that she had been with other people since our breakup and she was out with her friends, whilst I was crying in my room. So I was trying to kill myself because I was upset over being ignored and being let down by her. But now I feel that if I do commit suicide it'll be spontaneous, there'll be no plan, it'll just happen. I can already feel something or someone pushing me towards the edge. I know how I'm going to do it, but it won't be me doing it. I won't be in control and maybe that's exactly how I want it to be. I love my family, I love my friends, I love Amy. I don't want to die, I want to live, there's so much I want to do. I want to play the next Splinter Cell and watch John Wick 3, but not when I feel like I'm in hell. I feel numb. Lost. Adrift in an ocean of despair and loneliness. A man so broken by the events of his life that he'll never be whole again. And I want so desperately to make us both whole again. But as much as I don't want to admit it I believe that ship has sailed and it's never coming back. Depression kills everything. Your mind, body, soul, heart, family, friends, love and hope. It's the hardest thing to endure because only you can endure it. People can try to help you through it, but they can't share the weight by carrying your burden with you. Only you can and that's what makes you feel alone. Because you're the only person who understands exactly what it is you're going through. It's hard to listen to people telling you to stay strong when you have no reason to stay strong. It's those people who make you feel weak. It's those people taking your hope away from you by the things they say or do. My own mother and sister have called me selfish for wasting everyone's time when they're trying to ''help'' me. It pisses me off that my mum has called me selfish when she suffers from depression too and has wanted to do it herself, but the only reason she hasn't is because of me and my sister. In all fairness that's a perfectly good fucking reason to not do it. If I had kids I wouldn't do it because I have a responsibility to them. But because I have no kids, no job, no partner, I've got not responsibilities. So why shouldn't I be allowed to end it?I saw someone say on another reddit page that it's only selfish in the sense that I want something for myself and that it's the type of selfishness that someone should be allowed to have which to me is completely spot on. What's truly selfish is wanting someone to live in misery and permanent suffering just so you don't feel sad or upset over their passing. It takes true courage to make that jump knowing full well that you'll never go to the cinema again, eat your favourite food again or make love again. The only thing that stops us from doing it is the knowledge of the void we'll be leaving behind, but unfortunately it will get to a stage where we can't quite comprehend that. That's the danger of mental illness. It blinds us to the world around us. In our heads we're totally alone, which means there's no one to hurt. I've come to understands that life is a series of events that leads us down a path of darkness with occasional beams of light illuminating the way forward. It's not the destination that matters. It's how you get there and who you get there with. Unfortunately the person I wanted to get there with is no longer around."
It got so much better. And now I'm in hell again.,"I don't even know how to begin. About nine months ago I first posted here. I was in hell, like I've been for most of my life. Then at the beginning of the year I decided to risk it all. I told my best friend I always loved him. We got together. I felt like he gave me a purpose and made me felt alive. He showed me the path to get out of hell. I couldn't believe it. In fact, I lost it all. After a couple months, he broke up with me out of the blue, via message, and blocked me. I have been on meds ever since. Part of me wants to destroy him, or what he has become, as he's not who I knew but rather a stranger. Part of me wants to destroy myself. Because I thought it could get better, I could be happy. It's all gone in the blink of an eye. I just have no reason to be here. Life is not fair. I am so tired of fighting, and for what? I gave him everything and all I got as a thank you was to be treated worse than shit. Everything I've done with him was the bright side in my life. I have never been happier. Now everything just lost meaning. I feel like a robot, living because I'm supposed to, not killing myself because of the pain I would cause to my family. Sometimes I wish my life was really my own and that I could just end it. "
I want to die. I am hollow and fake and empty. I have been my whole life,"Everything just hurts so bad
I can't breathe and I am lying here crying begging some higher power to not let me wake up if I go to sleep I want it to be over. I don't want to be here
I just can't anymore. I can't pretend to be ok. What worth am I anyway, a repressed transgender with nothing but fear, sadness and pain to show my life I deserve this"
"No, I'm not okay","I'm definitely not okay. I'm very thoroughly fucked up in the head. I've been suicidal all day and I found myself googling how to obtain a gun in my state. I want to hospitalize myself, but my mom can't afford another hospitalization bill. I can't afford therapy (let alone medication), and don't even know who my insurance provider is. My depression has gotten exponentially worse in the past few days, and I can't sate it. I have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No friends. No social skills. No intelligence. No kindness. No self-control. No ability to learn. No skills, talents, or hobbies. Nothing. Nobody will ever really love me or care about me. I posted to  twice and nobody seems to care. I'll just forever be a burden and an annoyance to those I'm around. There is literally no good reason for me to stay alive. The objective, best course of action for me is to kill myself.EDIT: With regards to hospitalization, I'm also terrified it'll be on a permanent record and make me unable to get a job or give me a permanent x5 multiplier to my insurance costs."
I feel like I'm being pushed,"I feel like everyone around me is daring me to commit. I live in a care home with 3 other kids. They are constantly loud and annoying (I have a massive physiological problem with sound) and when I tell the staff they rub it in more, then make more sound themselves. They know I'm depressed and still take me as a joke. My mental state is getting worse, I am hallucinating and cutting myself, the kids at my care home keep me up all night and stop me from sleeping, they know what they are doing. Everyone I talk to finds a way to rub it in more, I have turned to drugs and any way to get high, I am getting closer to suicide every day."
I fantasize all the time about how people would react if I went through with it,"Would they be sad?  Probably.  Would they be angry at me for being selfish?  Maybe.  Will they pretend to care for a few days then go back to their normal lives, never thinking of me again?  Yeah."
I want to kill myself.,_���
"How come, I wanna kill myself, not because of depression or anything.","First of all, I'm an athiest. I just really wanna see the other side. If there is an 'other side.' Well I can admit that I'm a bit depressed. There's not a day that I think of doing it. It's just that, to me, life on the 'other side' is alot better than this shit. I don't wanna do 'it' myself, I just want some freak accident that will result to my death. "
Friend with BPD is starting to give up,"She has borderline personality disorder, so she is already suicidal almost all the time. It seems different now. She's not snapping back to her rational self. Her bf dumped her about a month ago and it's destroying her. I've been talking with her almost 24/7 so she wouldn't alone. I think I have until Saturday until she makes an attempt on her life. I'm trying to get a hold of her family. Worried they won't do anything though. I'm not sure what I should be doing and starting to panic. "
Heavily contemplating suicide,"So I'm 18 and have attempted suicide twice before but lately I've really been wanting to end it more then before, I can't find a girlfriend and have been single for 6 months on top of that I have a few pretty crap mental disorders like borderline personality disorder and bipolar depression and I don't want to live like this, I just want to end my pathetic life and start over seeing as I can't find a mate I'm useless as a human and deserve nothing more then death "
Hey. I have been thinking about suicide for the past few days.,"Hi. My story is rather simple. I am 24 years old and have always been unlucky, and failure. I have also been used as a laughing stock many times, in my group of ""friends"". That is the purpose I have served. I am not sure that I want to continue is this is all that life has to offer me. Few months ago, I went to travel with my friends, not a big trip, just a one day trip. And I kept being subject of all the jokes. It felt like I was being harassed or bullied. I feel like this is not meant to be happening now, I mean we are in 20s we are not in 8th grade anymore. But it happened, and it felt terrible.This is one of the event, but I have always been an outcast, all my life, always been laughed at. I have embarassed myself, people have ridiculed me. It has been an embarrassing life. I just feel like I can't do it anymore.I love my parents and they have showered me with love all my life. So I feel torn.Also, I have bipolar disorder, have failed two colleges, used to be an engineering major, but now doing some easy arts courses in a shitty college just to get a degree. I am about to graduate in like 8-9 months. But my degree is embarrassing, I have terrible score, and I am not getting employed either after graduation. And, quite funnily, I don't know whether I am even functional enough to work.Good thing about my life is that, I was born in a fairly wealthy family, so I am not worried about poverty or anything.Also, in few years I would be arranged married, and I just hate the idea of it. I mean what if I just completely hate the person? What if the person hates me? It is basically marrying a stranger. And the people I have met in my current college, I just can't get along with them at all, what if she is one of such person?.Also, I am supposed to not tell them about my illness, but it will eventually come out, and sometimes people even want a divorce when they realize they have been lied to in arranged marriages. It is the number one reason for divorce in India, I read in an article. But on the other hand, if I tell them that I have mental illness, they will interpret it as me saying ""I am crazy!!! I am lunatic"" and they will cancel it and not give me a chance. So I would feel like I am duping someone into something.It is just a terrible feeling of not experiencing and exploring what ""love"" is but just marrying a stranger. It will just be something that happens in TV.I spend like 7-8 hours easily on the internet, feeling guilty about it, feeling like I am just wasting my life. Have not been able to study since 21 days. Just not been able to motivate myself to sit and open a book and study. Have tried but just not been able to do it.Now I don't know if I want to continue living this life of hermit. No friends, no love, no work, terrible education, mental illness."
"I guess I'm not on the brink , but everything seems pointless. I'm having trouble finding happiness in anything.","Everything I do feels like it's for the benefit of other people. The only time I feel like I'm doing something for me is when I play videogames and even then that feels unfulfilling at times.I eat healthy , excercise, dress well etc to impress girls. Not because I actually I enjoy excercising or vegetables or anything.I go through the motions and college and maintain a 3.0 gpa just to keep my parents off my back. Not because I'm passionate about my major.I don't really have the money to make any drastic changes.I used to think finding love= happiness, but I'm feeling pretty deterred from putting in any effort into finding love since I've been shot down so many times before already .On top of that I'm fairly sure the world is ending, or at least I don't see things improving any time soon."
Thoughts of suicide make me lethargic.,"It feels good to know I could always punch the clock in case something goes wrong in my life. I'm starting to think of it casually, as if ""today is a good day to shoot myself in the head"". I fantasise going on a shooting range and putting 9mm up my mouth. This way I dont have to think  of bullshit such as my future. I don't care about anything, I'll probably get homeless or poor. I won't be waiting to hit the bottom.Yes, I'm that lazy."
don't see a reason to keep going,"my boss is cutting my paychecks but I can't call her out because I work for my college, my abusive mother keeps tightening her grip on me, I haven't had any real friends since elementary school. the rest would be ok if it weren't my mother. deaths the only way I can really escape her. I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I just don't see the point in trying. I've tried so hard for so many years"
School and Home Make me want to end my life...,"im a 14 year old high functioning autistic with severe adhd and nos anxiety and sensory processing disorder and i live in a backwoods bumfuck nowhere town with about a 1000 population and 1 school system and a abusive mother who refuses to homeschool me and tries to turn things around and say im an abusive person. she hits me and calls me things like worthless, piece of shit, never going to amount to anything, human trash, scum, ect. i get bullied at school by the teachers and kids alike and literally everybody hates me at that school because theyre all cousinfucking hicks and im ""weird"".
i want to die. if i miss school i have to worry about my mom coming home and screaming and calling me names and drinking and hitting me when i go to school i have no peace. i have to hide in my room with a school chromebook that i unblocked this is very physically straining please help i want to just die and hang myself but i get too scared sometimes."
I am exhausted,"It's been exactly five years since I ended up in a psych ward. Ten years since I started self harm. I am so tired of everything- the pain, the expectations, hurting others, being a burden... I'm a newlywed and I already fucked up. I am a broken failure. I keep trying things that could ""fix"" me and I end up deeper.This is my cycle, my five year breakdown. What's going to happen this time? will I even survive?"
Life is not what I imagined. I want to quit.,"I had an imagination of life and what it will be when I will graduate. It is not that. It is a nasty place full of rules. I tried to make myself accept the reality and compromise and keep going. Well, I don't want to anymore. I want to quit. I want to lose all my senses. I want to die a peaceful death instead of a fucking road accident. that is the ultimate goal left. "
It seems I have two options.,"��I've lost all and any motivation to continue my studies at college (4th year biochem major). It might seem I am close to graduation but my final year requires extremely intense labs and also a research project approved by the department. This project was suppose to start last year, I've done nothing. Right now I'm contemplating dropping out or commuting suicide. There's nothing more I want than to end my existence. Everyday I fantasize about ending my misery, thinking of ways to kill myself, how it would affect my family. These things put me to sleep at night. The best thing I've learned all year is that if I die my federal student loans are forgiven. I've tried couesnling twice and each time only amplified my depression. But now I've lost my health insurance and the counselors on campus have a month waiting list, by then I'll be failing each and every class. Obviously killing myself would destroy my family, but what do they want for me? Continue my life as a college dropout with a mountain of debt working a minimum wage job? I'd surely end my life then so why the wait?"
Seriously contemplating suicide,"Not sure if its a case of having second thought thats making me write this but i am seriously concidering ending my life, and i dont mean im planning it but rather just doing it. I have a 300ml bottle of liquid morphine next to me along with a full box of slow release morphine. I damaged my spine 4 yrs ago and have been in unbearable pain since.  I also had to undergo major spinal surgery back in feb. But since having the op my pain had trippled and I can no longer bare the pain.  I have been on morphine for the last 3 yrs so im now morphie dependant,  one of the side affects of which is complete lack of sex drive, so that part of the marrage is non existant not to mention that when you try to come off the morphone the withdrawal is hell.  All this has put major strain on my marrage to the extent that my wife doesnt want to be with me anymore and i dont blame her. The only thing that is making me hesitate is my 6 yr old twin boys.  I dont want them to be upset but i am seriously questioning as to weather or not that is a good enough reason to keep me here.  I spend 99% of the day in my bedroom as i can only be in a seated position for so long because of the pain.  Naturally my wife is down stairs most of the time so im alone upstairs,  I have tried to talk to my wife and although she knows it isnt my fault regaurding the spinal injury, I can see in her eyes that this is not the life that she wants. I really just want it to be over and done with, at least when im dead there will be no more pain and my wife can start to love her life."
I am dissapointment...,"So,i failed...hem.let me explain.
Me,my daughter and my wife were walking casually,we went throught small street with no lights,and then guy appeared with a knife,he was threatening them,and said if we dont give all we have,we will lose lives,i started talking,but he did not lisen,i attacked him,as i attaked him he dropper his knife,and it went into my leg,i startec punching him grabbed knife and attacked him in his stomach,he fell down,then we called police,and hospital,he is alive,but injuer,and i did not get arreseted as it counts as self defence,now,my daughter,i always told her about mercy and how you cant do anything with fighting and stuff,she nows have way diffrent view of me,she calls me murder,killer,trash and more,im going insane by it,she is 14 years old and she dosent understand that if i did not do that,she might have been injured or worse,my wife took it easy tho."
I am so frustrated,"I hanged myself 6 and half weeks ago. I barely survived. I have a scar on my neck from the 1/2 inch manilla that cut into my neck. Yet all I can think of right now is blowing my head off. I am on 20mg Lexapro, 10mg Zyprexa, and 100mg Lamotrigine. I spent all of yesterday cutting into my chest, because the pain makes not see the hallucinations I get every hour of every day. I just want to live a normal life."
I'm giving my life one last chance,"Hello reddit, i finally decided to find some help.in the next few days i wanna go visit a psychiatrist, and i was wondering if i should tell her everything (that i failed a suicide attempt last week and that i still have suicidal thoughts), or just that i'm depressed and socially awkward?what will she do ? can she inform anybody ? or she's just going to talk about it with me and prescribe me some medication ?"
[USA] my friend has been on the edge for months - advice please?,"by my friend i mean my internet friend.i can't help because i'm from the netherlands and any familiarity with the legal, psychiatry etc systems here i do NOT have for america.lets call him R. R has been in college for a while, switched majors around (to the disappointment of his parents) in an attempt to be good at something to find The Right Thing, something hes good enough at to graduate in it and get away from his parents. however... hes really REALLY depressed. he keeps talking about taking his own life and trying to take actual steps toward it.ive been there, but like.... i had parents that loved me and cared about me even tho they didnt have sympathy for my depression. i had no friends but people around me liked me enough to try and intervene. i never actually wanted to die, i just wanted to stop living this life.but in Rs case, when he told his parents he wanted to die they said ""keep me out of it not my problem"", they threaten to stop paying for college if he tries to lower the burden by taking one less class. theyre also threatening to take away his cat, the only thing he finds comfort in.so - shitty parents, a ridiculous amount of stress, no foreseeable graduation, no foreseeable independence, ""what other option is there for me but suicide?""and the worst part is? i dont know. i think id want to kill myself too if that were me. but i care about him so much and i dont want him to die but i dont know what to do.is there any place in the us where kids with heavy depression can take a breather"
Hey,"I'm not really sure what to say. I don't want to live, but i can't die because i'm too cowardly to comit and i don't want anyone in my family to feel responsible in any way."
just let me die,it�۪s all gone i just want to go home
I don't want depressed anymore,"I'm self-studying English myself using online source.
I kept finding out how shit the education is in my country.(my country is shit poor)
And every time that I found it out , it was a depression.
Should I keep studying?
Is it a road to suicide?Should I die straight away?
Since I'm a person who wasted 23 years on this shit country.
I'm a loser, I'm a inferior race guy......huhAH I need a girl or girlfriend to rely on her.
Can someone be my girlfriend plz.
I'm depressing."
"Failing School, rest of my family and friends doing really well, getting depressed and insulted by teachers","When I started school my parents were divorcing, so doing work felt impossible for me. Now I can't get out of that state, my grades are barely scraping by, my  siblings/friends are all getting A's, and even B's in their worst subjects. Whenever I try to answer a question one of my teachers just starts screaming at me.
Suicide has been on and off, sometimes I'm feeling normal, then as soon as something goes wrong It just gets worse and worse,,, Now Is one of the worst times the the point I feel a need to ask for help."
Found someone in r/depression that might need some assistance. (link in text),My Empty Record Message
"I, uh, do something bad.","I sometimes like to look at my gun cabinet and think about loading a shell and ending it. Sometimes I walk to it. I hate the fact I've been diagnosed with Asperger's and think if I end it now, suffering will be ended in the future for me or any future people I meet/date. Crippling lonliness and the shame for feeling it compound each other. I feel like I will ruin everything I touch.I put the barrel in my mouth today, though with the safety on. "
Does anyone else find comfort in writing suicide notes/letters/etc?,"When I am in an extreme state of vehement sadness, I enjoy writing documents surrounding a potential suicide if such a time is ever to come. Other than music, this has been the only thing that has allowed me to cope in an efficient manner."
"I'll never be normal, so what's the point?","I have Autism, so i genuinely can't process things like you normal people. So honestly, what's the point in living?"
I can't try anymore,"I think about ending my life and i don't even get sad anymore. I feel nothing. All the pills I take doesn't even touch how empty I feel. What else can i take to fill me up? All i do is throw myself into so much work i burn myself out, rinse, repeat. I just don't care for myself anymore. I don't enjoy living. I dont enjoy nature. I don't enjoy reading, and when i do read it takes me months to finish a book. I just don't care anymore. I honestly feel I am better off dead. The fight I've been fighting is so hard and it has no real end, not really. I will never be as happy as i was before it all happened. That in itself is a death that i mourn for everyday.
I keep him in a box of letters and photographs and birthday cards and a pregnancy test and i hide him away under my bed. I even kept a shopping list because I liked the way he included the particular brand of soap I liked. I can't look at them, but i can feel it pressing into my spine, into my dreams when i lay down at night. They itch to be poured over; to be held close or torn up.. but i can't do it. I just lay there.
I don't know why i keep these things anymore. I don't know why i breathe at all."
This afternoon after work I'm driving up to some cliffs and jumping off.,"The stress is way too much and I can't live with the shame of not being able to handle it, whilst most other people can.This stress of life just has an overwhelming effect on me and not only am I shockingly depressed all the time but it really impacts my cognitive functions which causes me to not be able to function well at work or in social situations.I can't keep living like this seeing the world pass me by. It's just painful, especially knowing that I used to be well and now can no longer live the life I planned to have."
Why can't you accept that some people want to die?,"That they're not interested in life and the ""it gets better"" and ""you have so much to live for "" don't work?Why can't you accept that they've chosen suicide?Why does it matter to you?You don't truly care,don't lie to me.Fuck you,you can't keep me here.Just accept that some people have made their decision and let us die,you lying fucks."
"Too weak to live or die. Like with most things, I'm just skating by.","That would be a cool song lyric, right? I used to want to write music until I found out that I'm absolute shit at anything I do. I'm not expecting any replies. Just want to get this out because I can't really tell anyone else. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone in my life with my sheer mediocrity and my host of emotional problems. I know I'm needed, but that doesn't mean I'm wanted. If I ever was wanted, it was as a 'stress reliever'. A warm mouth and tight grip that had enough self hatred to do things their girlfriends didn't. I willingly let myself be used and wonder why no one sticks around. I've fucked up so much in my life and I'm at a point where my fuck ups will impact not only me, but those who depend on me. I could fuck up one last time and be done with it. They'd heal and move on. That's what functional people do. Or so I assume. I won't do anything about this unending hopelessness I feel because I don't have the stomach, but everyday I hope something takes me off this planet. Gotta be a drunk driver or a stray bullet in my sketchy neighborhood with my number. I'm afraid to die of course, but I'm afraid that this will be me until the end of my days. Existing hurts. And when things are good, it hurts even more when things come crashing back down. I'm exhausted. "
Most suicidal day of my life,"I'm a dramatic and angry person. I'll never know why I'm here and how to make the best of it. But I can see so many other people doing such a great job. My only issue is I like to do something perfectly or throw it away. That feeling extend to everything. As soon as I fail or someone makes me realise I have an ugly side...I want to throw myself away. Easier said than done. But the feeling never really fully fades,  this frustration at all of the things I can't take back or fix,  and have to live with for the rest of my life. I'll never claim perfection and I know that's impossible but other people seem to do pretty well. I'd like to meet their standards at least. Most of the time I can not care but some days it all just piles on. Getting help hasn't worked. Taking time out just distracts briefly and is a cover up. This is me. Forever. That's a hard thing to take. I know it's hard to understand,  but that's who I am. It's who I've always been. I can't fix this. I'm broken permenantly. I don't know what to do. Counselling didn't work.
Nothing works.
I spent the whole day crying over a mistake. I stayed in bed. I didn't want to face the people in my house,  so I didn't eat dinner. Am I being too dramatic?  Maybe. I just don't want to do life right now. I know it'll go away but in that time I wanted to die so badly. I wish I could do it. "
I can't get it out of my head,"I don't feel like I definitely want to die but I'm getting a bit too close for comfort I think. I've made a pro and con list. Six pros for one con.b I've been googling different ways to do it,how painful they are,their success rate,how easy they are to achieve.
I just feel like it'd be just easy and peaceful and I wouldn't have to think about this anymore. But I know this feeling comes and goes in stages. A little while of this and a little while of feeling normal,but the little whiles of this are stretching out longer and longer. And I'm lying to everyone and when I try to be honest  it's about how they feel or noone can handle it or I should just take pills and get over it. I don't really want to die I don't think but I just want to stop thinking this way."
"I am alone, always will be. I think I'm gonna go check out now.","I have never been with anyone and I know now that I never will. I am more repulsive(physically) than I realized. I have nothing to offer anyone other than laughs and compassion but apparently that isn't good enough. So I'm done, hopefully there's something on the other side..."
I wanted to take my life when my parents were asleep,"3 days ago, I was sobbing in bed at 11:27 pm. The thought of taking my own life was so strong, it still rattles my bones. I don't know what triggered me to think so, only knew how shitty I felt. I'm scared the thought might come back again and unsure whether I can handle it well. I'm scared I won't have enough willpower to fight against it. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid to bring this up with anyone especially to my parents. Naturally, being the coward I am, turn to reddit to vent out my feelings. "
I put a rope around my neck today,"Not a suicide attempt, but it's probably the way I'd chose to go. I wanted to know how it feels, so I put it around my neck and pulled it enough to cut off some air for a bit. It almost felt good. Am I playing with fire too much?"
16 and without hope,"I'm a 16 year old girl who's life is going down the toilet. I'm never good enough for my parents. And now that my grades are going down, they will be even more disappointed in me. I was sexually assaulted last week, which was traumatic, and nothing has happened with the cops. I struggle with depression and self harm, and I recently relapsed. I just want to die. There are train tracks near my house, and I think that's what I'm gonna do. Hopefully I go to heaven. "
I've spent the last 6 years living a lie and I just want to end it all.,"Hey, my name is Beau and I've never posted on here before but I don't think I can keep all my pain I  anymore. I feel like I should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here I go.When i was 3 years old I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. I spent 2 years in and out of hospital, I didn't even know what was happening all I knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep. I would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away. I think this is where I first felt that I couldn't trust people and that I was completely alone.
I got better after that and went to a nice school, it seemed like everything was fine. I made some great friends I still know very well today and I seemed to be adjusting well even though I joined school late.
Then I turned 8 and everything fell apart again, I got another brain tumour and this time I was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before. I knew what was happening and I didn't want to die. I won't go on about it again but obviously I survived but it left me with some complication. My pituitary gland had been damaged by Chemotherapy and so I couldn't go through pubity unless I had the help of synthesized growth hormones which I had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years. They worked pretty well though. I would never have grown an inch and I'd still be the height I was at 10 years old but I'm 5'9 which is fine with me.
There was one problem though, I felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones I was given were only experimental. I was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but I never spoke to anyone about it. Then I went to college and got to 're invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you can't really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me I still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls I liked wanted to go out with me. Well I know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you aren't bad people. They're good people, they don't bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus don't find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully you.Now let's get to the title.
I've spent the last 6 years living with a girl that I've been In love with for about 5 of those years. We've had an incredibly strange relationship. We were never going out. We never had sex. We never kissed. It's wasn't romantic for her. But we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips. I was extremely confused because i told her I liked her but she said she didn't want to ruin our friendship. We've spent almodt every day together for the last 6 years. Im not a person anymore, I've lost my identity. Fast forward to now. She's decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy. One that she wants to be with, he's taller , stronger and hotter than me. You can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and we've been together for so long that to me she was my other half. Now I'm alone. I'm having to move back to my parent and I actually just want to kill myself. The saddest thing is she doesn't even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold. I think the main reason I'm sad and she isn't is that I know that the time I spent with her even though she didn't love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best I could ever expect for myself. I'll be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine. She find the things I gave her and more from her new boyfriend.
I don't know what to do, should I just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now? I need some advice from people who won't sugar coat it."
I can't keep doing this,"I'm just so beyond done with life like, I don't want to continue living at all. Nothing makes me happy and I mean not a single damn thing. I've gained a bunch of weight, I have no friends, no skills or hobbies, like life is just meaning less to me.I don't want to work at all, I also don't want to get money from the government. All I want is death at this point. I don't want a future, I don't want a happy life, I just want death. Its all I can think about and ive been trying to kill myself these past couple days but obviously I can't even do that.I'm just so tired of living like why can't I choose to end my life. I never asked to be born, i never asked for this life and now I'm supposed to be forced to survive just because maybe possibly in the future it could get a little bit better. No fuck that, I can't live like this much longer I just can't _���_��� for the love of god plz I want to die"
I'm just so done,Hey guys. I'm 15. I have been depressedfor almost three months Now and I am just so done. I'm exhausted. I physically ache. I'm tired. And I need a reason to keep doing this because I really really want to die. It's all I want to do. Everyday. I'm so exhausted. I don't want to fight it anymore. I need a reason to live. I'm so discourageded. I'm going through self harming withdrawals. I hurt. I'm tired. I tried to kill myself ny overdose on Sunday. I wish I had. Please someone give me advice. I'm really lost
Seriously Considering,"Now, for some backround, I have thought of dying and how much better it would be many many times.  I'm 37 and have been having thoughts like this for nearly my entire life.  Outside of once or twice though, It's not something I ever felt like I was serious about.  Last night however, I scared even myself.  It has been a bad week.  Nothing too terrible and stuff that I know most people could, and I should, be able to just shrug off and keep going.  However, it feels like certain people, mainly my boss/Dad and sometimes my wife, are actually trying to piss me off.  It's pretty well known to them that once I get really pissed off, to the point of walking away, that I end up very very depressed, yet it seems like they do it on purpose anyway.  For example, yesterday, I was out on our mobile store, because the regular driver quit a while back.  It runs on a propane generator, or we can plug in, to run the lights and A/C unit back there.  I was at a site where running the cord left a trip hazard, so decided against pulling out the cords and just ran the generator.  Supposed to be there from 12-5.  Around 2PM, on what is one of the hottest days of the year in South Texas and the generator runs out of propane.  My fault in a way because I forgot to check it.  I don't drive this thing though.  It requires a CDL which I don't have.  One of our other drivers drives it to the site for me, i drive his van and he goes about his day doing a different task while I man the mobile store.  So it's not an option for me to simply go fill the propane and carry on.  So, I bring out the cords and plug in.  It's 2 cords, this is important.  One cord that has a standard plug on one side and the other end is the big round 3-prong plug normally found on washing machine, because that's what the truck uses to plug in to the generator or the cord.  Now this single cord by itself was not long enough, so I get the second cord, which I call an extension cord, which has a male and female end with the round plugs.  So in short, I plug the cord with the regular wall socket in to the wall, run the cord out, plug the extension cord in to that cord and plug that in to the truck.  Pretty simple right?  Well, it didn't work, and here's where all that becomes important.  I call my boss/Dad and explain the situation to him.  His answer is, ""What do you mean extension cord, I've used that cord at the office before and it works.""  I reply with, ""Yes, I've used the standard cord before and know it works, but I have not used the extension cord before, as far as I know it is untested and the previous driver never plugged in anyway.  I'm guessing it's faulty.""  So he responds, ""I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean extension cord?  What is that?  I've never seen one before.""  So I proceed to describe the two cords the same way I did above.  He still has NO FUCKING CLUE what I am talking about.  This is one of the things that easily upsets me.  I know it probably shouldn't, but it does.  When I explain something really fucking simple and someone just does not understand.  So he starts bitching at me that he doesn't have time to deal with this.  I say fine, I'll just hang out, only a couple hours left at this point, I can sit in the A/C of their break room and come out when people approach the truck and then go back to the A/C.  It won't be too bad.  He says no, that's unacceptable for the customer experience.  I agree to an extent, but these guys need what we are there to provide.  So he decides, instead of just taking my word it's not working, that he's gonna come out and take a look, bitching the whole time that he does not have time for this.  I agree, I tell him i do not think it's going to do any good to come out, but I am getting really upset at this point because he doesn't know what a damn extension cord is.  So he gets there, realizes what it is and that it's faulty and bitches some more about having to come all the way out there.  Decides to call the other driver back, close up shop and reschedule.  That's fine, I need to get out of there anyway, I'm having a really tough time not losing it at this point.  So I wait around another little bit for the other driver to show up, swap vehicles, go out through security who has to inspect the back of both vehicles and it takes some time.  Drive all the way back across town and it's nearly 4 at this point.  Now, keep in mind, that because I had to leave for this appointment at 11 and we were there from 12-5, I had not had lunch.  I've been out in the heat for the past 2 hours and am dead tired.  So I am telling him this and that at this point, I really just want to head home and eat.  Instead, he assigns me a task that he knows is gonna take me 2-3 hours.  WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK?!?!?  I have not eaten all day, I am covered in sweat, I have black crap all over me and my clothes from moving those dirty cords around, I had come in early that day because I had other stuff that needed to get dome before I left for the appointment and now he's wanting me to stay late?!?! With no lunch?!?!  I'm pissed, walk out, went home and sat in the shower for an hour.  Finally went downstairs and ate dinner then wife heads off to bed after getting our daughter in bed.  This is where I was sitting there, and really seriously considering just killing myself.  I was even <removed because I guess it's explicit and against the rules>.  I did not actually <removed> of course, as I am here today, but I was very close and today I am very scared of what I might do.  In the end, I was thinking about how it would be for my wife to wake up to that.  She would likely lose her job as she would not be able to go due to having to deal with a dead me and getting our daughter to school, or whatever else she would have to deal with.  So I didn't.  But it's the closest I have come and I am scared of myself.  If I had been just a little angrier or more depressed, would I have carried through?  I don't know.  All I know is that I had an incident Friday that really set me off, then another Tuesday and then this.  I'm at my wits end.  These little things should not bother me so much, but they do.  I should be able to just ignore it and carry on, but I can't.  The scenarios play over and over in my head no matter how much I try to distract myself.  I go to sleep with the incidents playing in my head, I dream about them, the same things happening over and over.  I wake up with them on my mind because I was dreaming about it.  It won't go away and I want it to."
I'm not depressed persay,"I'm not really depressed.
I have had much worse times in my life.
I was an unemployed homeless person for a while.
I have a car and a job and friends who like me.
I just recently got a promotion to be the lead of my department (retail).
I am a 29 year old single gay male who probably is a bit too promiscuous.
I have a roommate who cares about me and we get along great.But even given all that there are days like today where I'm tired.
I don't want to go to work or talk to anyone.
I don't want someone to make me feel better because I don't feel sad.
I don't feel anything.
I'm tired and I want it to be over.
I'm tired of being the one who has to tell people that there are reasons to care that you are still alive (talked 3 of my friends down from suicide in the last couple months).
I don't want to have to deal with being alive anymore.
I find myself trying to figure out a way to kill myself and it freaks me out that I have come this far but then 5 minutes later I am back to planning my own death.
While writing this I have gone back and forth between planning this as my note to my friends and family and being freaked out that there is nothing wrong so why do I want to kill myself.
I can't decide if I'm going to try to kill myself or go to sleep.
I hope I can fall asleep before I try something."
Laying here just ready to pass out,"I've got an urgent dental appointment tomorrow...   work is trying to get back into full swing, difficult challenging things to take care of in order to even exist.  I've got quizzes and reports for school.  Haven't kept up with anything, I should withdraw.I don't care about any of it though, I don't hate it, except for maybe school.I just hate being alive, I hate thinking.  I hope I pass out soon..."
I really have tried I just don't have the energy or hope anymore.,"I grew up for eight years with a mother who has BPD. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a incredibly abusive and toxic personality disorder.
My Father allowed this for years, until she attempted suicide underneath my bed on one Thanksgiving and was removed from my home.Following this I grew up with maids and nannys because my father was often at work. One of them was abusive towards me for serval years but never left marks on my body. My father never believed me. So when CPS came over (as they did multiple times) nothing was ever done.I was sent to a boarding school for two years when I was a teenager by my ex stepmother. Whom my father married after knowing her for a week on eharmony. Really fucked up place. One of the staff members that managed me actually gave birth to a child under her dorm room deck and left it there to die (Google: Jesscia Bradford, JYA), no one noticed until it started it stink.As an adult. It look me awhile to get used to being a person again if that makes sense.
I took some LSD, went to some amazing music festivals.
I stopped drawing as often and became an aerialist, it was extremely cathartic. Doing it professionally across the country helped me see and experience a lot.Starting last year I cried about it a bit, then got over myself and became a stripper.
Gigs alone were good money but weren't enough to keep me moving forward in life while in a stable place. Also my father had quit working at that point because of his depression, my family was living off of food donations at home. I knew I needed to do something for my future that was fast money.
 The job itself can be pretty depressing (sometimes hilarious), but overall excellent money.
I worked hard for a year. I bought a car, payed off all previous medical debts, furnished my apartment..Things were finally starting to look up for me. I was finally starting to get stable and then start saving to go back to college.
Then I found out my family had lost health coverage because my father quit paying the bill six months ago, I was once again swamped with medical debts that were not my fault (also may I add I found this out after I had loaned him money for his car payments that month, he knew what my job was)  this time.I injured myself while training last month. I have no health insurance to get treatment, I cannot walk around to go make money to afford the treatment or get another job. I have 1000$ saved and that will only get me an MRI.
My county indigent will not take me. I make too much per month.
 I cannot find a sliding scale clinic in my county who does orthopedics.I am 24 years old now. I have tried, and fucking tried my best. I think I'm ready to go. I just got my DL two years ago, I have nine credit hours in college, and my father spent my inheritance. I'm tired of men touching me who don't give a fuck about me. I'm tried of feeling alone with no one to turn to for help. I'm sick of feeling trapped.
If I have to live in a country where people are so selfish for resources that we don't even have tax paid universities and tax paid doctors... I don't think I want to exist in it anymore.
If letting twenty different men a night suck my tits is the fastest and most efficent way to pay for these things, rather than being stuck in debt for years with no place to live in the meantime... It's the kind of tired that sleep won't fix."
I am in desperate need of help,"Ive been suicidal for a few weeks now but the past couple days have been the most extreme. I am very very close to commiting suicide and i want to tell someone, anyone; but there is a part of me that wants to do it that just stops me from telling anyone that has the capability of stopping me from doing it. Today has been a constant mental battle with myself trying to motivate myself to text someone about it but when i try to reach for my phone with one hand the other hand just pulls it away wanting me to not do it so i can kill myself. My mental and emotional stability is depleting day by day."
"Mini-Rant: I am tired of needing distractions from life. I want a reason to look forward to life itself, not distractions from life.",I totally get why and I'm actually in the same situation but I would also like to say that sometimes you need to distract yourself for long enough until you're in a positive enough place to look forward to life.
Feeling alone,"I asked one of my closest friends (I thought we were close) if I should go to school tomorrow, she said ""dont even bother, you're too lazy to even get off of bed"".Sorry ma'am, it's called depression, ever heard of it?"
I know when i'm going to do it.,"I'm going to stab myself while taking in the beautiful view from a park near where i live. I'll start the day off by breaking up with my shit boyfriend. then i'll tell my ex i cheated on her. i feed myself with my favourite foods. i'll make sure the day before i talked to and said goodbye to all my friends. i'll do what i want, i'll go where i want. i'll tell the person i've liked for years that i like them. then, i'll go to the park. i'll sit down in one of the boardwalks, (it's empty at night) and impale myself. i'll get high as fuck before i do it, so pain isn't a problem. i'll let myself bleed out. i'll throw the knife in the water. this is how i want to die. 10/10/0711:11"
My confession,"At the beginning of my seventh semester, already riddled with the feeling of guilt for having my parents spend much money on my education, I took it upon myself to do whatever I can to recover it. I refrained from going out with friends; eating out, and I never went on trips with them. I started working online, earned enough to sustain myself and save a little for the future. An opportunity to save more arose when a internship opened up at a company. Upon consulting with my seniors, I learnt it was no good a company to work for. Even so I joined, for the monetary benefits that it provided. I would be paid a stipend and also the dormitory fees for the final semester would be returned. Little did I know what I was signing up to.On my first day of joining, I immediately regretted my decision. The place was far off and the people, even more so. I travelled in public transport, many a time standing most of the journey, which took more than an hour and a half each way. With what little money I had left after all that was spent on travel, I bought gifts for my family. With all this travelling came the physical strain, and a chronic back ache. I put up with all this for more than five months, hoping that if I could make it six months, that would suffice, and I would then work on getting abroad. Little did I know that the hard part was yet to come.Little did I know, that my very own parents, for whom I sacrificed so much would make me feel pain, more than I even experienced before. I always thought I could take pain. I was right, I could. There are two types of pain, the physical, and the mental. No one realises that the latter is much worse. I have sacrificed so much for them, and now when I need them the most, they turn on me. Treat me like a criminal for I am not working, not brining income, not putting money on the table. I have taken time out, to write GRE, IELTS, GATE and to learn German language. I know there isn't enough time. Yet, I am misunderstood, and taunted and harassed for not working. For not making money. I have no place at what I used to call my home. I am criticized for where I sit, and for using my laptop, and the wires that surround it. I am criticized for the way I sleep. A man needs two things in life to know he does not belong there; the lack of a place to live, and the lack of respect. I have neither here. I have contemplated ceasing to exist, but decided against it for the people that know me, and for my dream.My own mother who I have come to despise, for her constant taunting, and chiding, and her narcissistic nature, has no love for me. Her anger issues and irritable nature has changed me, deepy and fundamentally. I have come to realise they value money more than anything else. For the past few months, depression has been lurking above my head like a dark cloud. And now I feel it has finally taken me over. I feel numb, devoid of all love and feeling. I have come to a point where I am beginning to wonder; Why should I go on?"
My OCD is making me want to die.,"Existing is so exhausting, everything needs to be done over and over and over again. Stand up go and wash my hands, pet the dog wash my hands. Before I put on clothes I have to shake them and make sure they are clean, I dont get to just do anything, everything has to have a procedure before it. I just want to be normal. Im tired of worrying about everything, Im tired of everything hurting. I just want it to stop."
What's happening. Worst month. Don't think my pills can take it,"On 15mg lexapro plus mirtazapine. This week I got failed from 3rd year of engineering, got broken up with after 2 and a half years, and now I possibly (probably, from first scan) have a brain tumor. I want to drink myself to death"
No Hope,"There is no hope left for me. I have a poisoned ill mind inside of a weak frail body. The words the people I love say to me hurt so much because they are right. I am selfish, weak, pathetic, worthless and lets not forget sad. I just don't see the point anymore and the only thing keeping me from suicide is the fear of death."
Find myself thinking of killing myself a lot more than usual lately.,"Not sure what it is in particular.  Work is really rough, told my boss I couldn't do it anymore.  He'll try moving me somewhere else.  I sold the car I liked for a broken car that I don't.  That hurts a lot, but it happened a bit ago now.  I've lost my faith and trust in my parents.  They send me down the wrong path, I'll probably disown them in the near future.  I also need to move out soon, said parents are getting divorced.Still, the car bit and the parent lack of faith bit happened weeks ago.  Now my brother's wedding is coming up, and I'm trying on a suit.  And all I can think about is 'You should kill yourself', rather than 'huh, this fits well/not well'.  Over and over, 'Kill yourself'.  Gets in the way, it's so persistent.I guess I've started feeling dead inside the past few days, weeks.  Just...tired.  All the time.  I don't care about anything. But, I don't even need to feel better.   I want to be able to put on a strong face for my little bro, and be happy for him, and with him, on his big day.  It can all end after that for all I care.  My brother can still be happy."
"have always fantasized about suicide, but now i'm feeling it more than ever","I was friends with this boy and I developed feelings for him. It wasn't a long friendship but it was a close and an intimate one. He ended it tonight after I called him out for leading him on, saying that I crossed some boundaries that he had and abused his trust. I feel so broken. I feel like I'm a horrible person and incredibly difficult to develop an intimate friendship with--maybe because I crave them so bad. I started fantasizing about taking handfuls of pills today and killing myself. It wouldn't be my first attempt. This friend himself was suicidal and our discussion about our shared experiences was something that brought us closer. Now all I want to do is make him feel the same way that he wanted his ex to feel when he tried to kill himself. I want some sort of power.I had a friend come over and help me out a little, but I still feel so horrible. This always happens to me--I get close to someone, get vulnerable, and get badly hurt. Why should I even try to be close to people? Some friends say it's a beautiful thing, but does it matter if it's beautiful if it keeps causing me pain? I just miss this guy so much. I don't have many close friends, and I feel so lonely. I told him I was feeling unsafe and that he needed to call me and stay on the phone with me until my friend came. He said he felt terrified and manipulated. I apologized and backed off, and luckily my friend showed up. I can't believe I tried to use my own suicide to get him to talk to me--it just makes me feel like I'm even more of a bad person.I can see why he hates me. He says I'm a good person, but he hates me. No one will like me, let alone love me. No one stays. After my parents die, I should probably just die with them. Their sadness is one of the only things that keeps me going right now. "
My existence is abhorrent to her,"Things ended a little rough 2 months ago.
The only thing I've heard from her since is ""STOP"" on repeat. Soon I assume she's going to inform the authorities as I'm basically harassing her at this point. She already threatened to do that when I went to her place.I've tried everything I can. I kept up my health to a tee for the first month, I saw and slept with other girls to try to tell myself I was over it but I literally just cried in their arms instead and then I felt so much worse after.I tried taking to a behavioral therapist.I tried spending time with friends.I tried spending time alone.I tried meditation.I tried drugs and that only made me worse.I'm not willing to try medication I'd rather be dead.I'm lucky enough to have access to firearms but I still can't pull the trigger. The suicide by cop method seems pretty good because then I can't turn back. I could get her to make the call if I went there, the police would come guns already drawn.I'm disgusted with myself, I've realized that my existence is solely made up of my ego which has been inflated with fakeness. My whole sense of self, self esteem, and confidence are built on a fake foundation.I just want the strength to go through with it. If I went to her place and she called the cops I'm sure I could get one of them to do it for me.She told me ""I want to keep my options open. There are a lot of things you do that I could still find different and better from others. I want to discover more. I want to meet others too. I don't want to be frusterated at your character more. I don't want to hold myself down. I am not in a clear place. I need to clear my head and heart.
I don't think I love you right now.I am frusterated and confused at what to do""I'm obviously disposable anyways and that fact will never ever change. I just wish I had the strength.My parents have instilled so much guilt in me that it's holding me back. I wish I could forget about it and pull the trigger.Or if I tell her my intentions she would probably make the call, they'd find me one way or another and same would happen.I'm so fucking tired of this every single day. It takes me hours to get out of bed and hours to fall asleep I can't do this shit anymore.I would lay down my life for her but my existence is repugnant to her now. I'm fuckin worthless.I keep wishing I could flip my car or I wish this plane would just fall out of the sky.I never really understood why my friends did this in the past but now I completely understand. I just wish I had the balls they did. And people get over it anyways, eventually they forget and no one ever talks about it."
The final straw,"hi whoever is reading. I'm 15 here and giving up, the sad thing is it's hard to explain. I think people think I'm crazy and a little ""off"" but I've been so disconnected and at this point I just need to free me from me, I can't even look people in the eyes and have so much anxiety in public no matter where I go I am going to feel like I'm being watched and it's an insane feeling, like I've just been exposed  kind of feeling. People think I'm weird and unusual but I don't want to be feared because I would never cause harm to anyone ever. I'm breaking down crying nearly everyday and don't feel comforted.
Space. There is always going to be space between me and who I come in contact with because at the end of the day I'm eternally lonely and have realized that it's my responsibility to carry the weight of my conscious which is so heavy right now. I don't remember the last time I was hugged or talked to someone, I feel very weak and incompetent. I'm so lonely but scared to kill myself because I want it to be painless. Please get help if you feel this way, may you be freed from the entities taking over your soul, I don't know what this is, I am so
depersonalized "
Need to reset my body clock,I'm wide awake at night and don't start to fall asleep until like 5 Am and its all thanks to my old job which gave me tons of night shifts. Thankfully I left that stupid place and my new job is day shifts only but my sleep clock is completely screwed. Will I ever sleep at night again!!?
I am going to kill myself (or at least attempt),I have 2330 mg of fluoxetine which i am going to overdoes on. Wish me luck
I just can't take this misery anymore,"I feel so in deep shit and pain, I feel like worst than this is impossible. I feel like doing something that isn't right. Well my problems started when I accepted to start a life in a different country, with my uncle, well my uncle kicked me out of his apartment, so I found a place in the worst dorm you could imagine, I have a chamber that is smaller than the average bathroom, with the pieces of the roof falling on my head, with public toilets that the animals I live with, don't even flush after they shit, and a lot of things that bother me but would be a waste to write them. My health is fucked, I did 2 surgeries and I still have the health problem, I have terrible back pain that makes my life miserable, I have hives, and still battle acne, my throat aches like hell from snoring and I am still battling depression. My family treats my like shit, and my uncle abuses me verbally and emotionally, because of his frustrations, plus my parents are divorced. All that I have are my friends that are all far away from me, they live in other EU states.
I have to pass an exam in a language that I don't really understand. And regarding my dating life it is a fucking mess, even though I am not needy or I don't show my problems. I see all those girls somethimes looking at me in the eyes and I feel that I will never be with them, it is horrible.
I know everything could be worse and I should be positive but fuck this shit I am contemplating suicide"
Means and will. Need an opinion,Want to listen? I deserve it. Need an objective opinion.
This is what human weakness looks like.,"Depression has been eating me alive for over 20 years. Everything was great until highschool and I don't really know what happened. I've been going through the motions for a while... have a home paid off, wife and kids... but even still it seems like I'm only still here for everyone but myself. If life were an amusement park ride, it needed maintenance when it was my turn. Not looking for sympathy, not looking for encouragement. I simply need to know if anyone has any ideas to start enjoying things again. As of now I wake up, go to work, watch my kids, speak to my wife, use the computer, go to bed. I sleep most of the weekend away or piddle with some pointless task. I didn't start drinking until I was in my 30s, and now that's pretty much the only solace that remains.I think about suicide about 10 times a day. When I first wake up to go to work, when I bring my kids to daycare, when I sit down at my desk, when I look at the clock and it isn't moving, when I think about my life and my legacy... Pretty much anything real or lasting.I've failed at everything I set out to do in life and pretty much have just been going with the flow since. My dream was to be a computer game designer. While I'm not stupid or incapable of learning I simply lack any semblance of organization or follow through. Used to tell myself that it was probably for the best, and I'd be going down a new and exciting path I never meant to take... but it's not the case.I held out hope for years as the most cliched piece of support I typically receive advises. Now the old body is starting to fall apart and my ticker is giving out. I'm out of hope and I really don't like the idea of a slow descent into medical debt... undoing everything I worked so hard for my whole life by buying a few extra years seems... for lack of a better word... insane.I'm still very concerned for my families well being so I am considering a very painful ""accidental death"" in the near future. The policy has been active some time and hopefully I've been nondescript enough. I guess I'm only here for one reason not to. I've pretty much checked out mentally so any arguement for the kids is moot (I've written them extensive... almost book length messages they will receive upon my death and I feel it adequately sums up who I was and what I think they need to know.The only time I can speak like this is behind the mask of a VPN while browsing private. Not a soul other than my wife knows about my depression, and she's not strong enough to lean on anymore. I don't have family or friends and my co-workers aren't exactly the best people to talk to when I'm on the edge.Thanks for taking the time to read, and hopefully you never find yourself going down the same path. If you're wondering, yes, I have thought about how this will affect my children.... I will kindly refer you to what I said earlier about living only for others. It's gotten to the point I'm very tired of it. I'd like at least one act in this life to be what I want by my own hand."
I'm Not Beginning to See the Light,"27/M/thisgodlessrockHello friends,
First time OP, long time lurker, my apologies for the rules I inevitably break.  I'm not good with first times.Beginning of this summer I made a decision to try to better myself.  I started showing up to my cubicle on time, set up my old weight bench in my solo apartment, converted to a strict calorie-deficit diet, started jogging on the reg.  Put away the credit cards.  It's not going well.  I've put in the work consistently for months now to no show of improvement.  My body has lost muscle and I'm back to my ghoulish high-school ectomorphic self with a spare tractor tire instead of my old car tire.  I'm further in debt from making bad decisions under exhaustion.  I see myself in the windows on my jogs and I just want to break down over how ugly I am.  The cheap mirrors in my apartment haunt me every time I walk by them and the voices in my head have become demonic and cruel.  I'm so alone but I really cannot afford a pet, nor would I want to subject an animal to my demeanor.Undisturbed I sleep 14-16 hours a night, my doctor says its the depression.  My psychiatrist (fifth one now) is more cynical than I am - he tells me the pharmaceutical industry is a corrupt wash these days and pulls a new anti-depressant out of the hat for me to try.  I'm currently experiencing endless headaches and brain zaps trying to switch off of effexor.  I'm on viibryd now - I just tell myself it helps.  It's a pretty blue color which is nice.I've started asking girls out again (I'm a straight male) with nothing to lose and I've been curved and ""friend-zoned"" more times than I can count.  In high school/college I was the go-to sucker for homework help and now at work I'm the go-to sucker for work problems.  The only relationship I've had was with a girl who was abusive physically and mentally for two years and regularly cried over how ugly/worthless I was until I ended things.  My parents divorced and both fell out of their careers (i.e., gave up on life) when I was young so I have no support systems.  I've tried to rekindle friendships with my old friends who moved away and the new people I meet; but most have literally told me to fuck off (I've never left the northeast US, maybe being rude is a regional thing?).  I post on social media in desperate attempts for attention despite never getting likes and cringing over it.  I'm a Jets fan, a Mets fan, a Democrat - but not a masochist. It's a bad combination.  The only thing keeping me going is that the physical pain of exercise is nothing compared to the mental anguish of depression.The old ways I used to distract myself don't work anymore.  I basically just smoke pot 'til I don't know what caring is and play the same music over and over.  Recently though I turned the music off and I don't think it's coming back on.I've never left the East Coast; I'm in an incessant amount of debt so I can't really relocate.  But I'm thinking of taking out the credit cards one last time to make it to a nice west coast beach where I can decide how to end it once and for all.I don't want to be here anymore it hurts constantly and I'm exhausted.  My brain keeps showing me lights at the end of the tunnel but when I get close they're just stars from near black-out and the tunnel is dark again.What do I do?"
Idk. Help. I guess.,"Can someone talk to me or watch with me tonight or just accompany me tonight. Umm. I'm  currently thinking of overdosing pills but I heard from a friend that's a bad idea since it would just lead to me not dying and having my stomach pumped and now I'm thinking of jumping off our balcony. I'm 9 floors up. Sorta scared that it will fail though and I don't want it to fail. I just wanna disappear. It's more like I wanna run away from all my responsibilities right now and I'm stressed out. I'm graduating in uni soon. And I have thesis to write and med school entrance exams and I cannot fail. But I'm tired. I'm just so tired. I don't like the situation I'm in right now. I just hurt my boyfriend and I'm really regretting it. But of course he won't talk to me. Idk. This is my first time really considering to just drop dead. I was thinking someone to talk to would help but at the same time, I just cut off contact from everyone I know. Or at least care kinda. I don't have a telephone to call hotline. Not like our country gives a shit much about mental health. "
when do i get a fucking break? im just tired of this bullshit. there's always going to be some crap i have to work my ass off for.,"spend 14 years from junior kindegarden to gr 12 stuck in school because you have to work hard and go to university.spend 4 years in university work even harder so you can graduate and get a degree.spend how much else longer interviewing all day long so you can land a job.spend all day at work come home and have just a few hours to myself fucking rinse and repeat. i dont wanna live that kind of life, it's so fucking unfair i just wanna do what i wanna do. not all of this fucking crap.everyone will say that i'm born lucky, but i wanna know why i couldnt have just been born filthy rich. enough money so that i could spend all day doing whatever the fuck i felt like, not studying hard in university for a job where even if i work for 40+ years i still will be poor ccompared to rich peoplle.there are kids who are born today who once they get their inheritence will have more money than i will ever have, maybe even mmy entire family has and they wouldn't have lifted a single muscle. all i want to do is just fucking play league but i can't because of stupid ass school then i'll have a stupid ass job coming home tired and sweaty as fuck can't even play in a shit mood probably. i just want to leave this crap, it's a never ending cycle of bullshit and struggling. fuck off"
"""vote up if"" I Done Goofed","I have failed to do anything with my life.  For the last fifteen years I have had three jobs, two have lasted around a year and the third a few months.  I knew about bitcoin when one could buy multiple for a single dollar and I had no clue that it would be what it is today.  The idea of trying to find a job with my resume-gaps, dealing with asshole employers, working for minimum wage, working simply to live, and basically being treated & paid like a slave-with-benefits, makes me want to end my useless life.  I enjoy helping others and I despise taking advantage of people (I am not going to sell someone something they do not need).  I am not lazy:  when I work, I work hard.  I was once offered a job while working because I was the only one consistently working when a contractor walked through several times throughout the day.  But I am dumb as I miss opportunities a lot.  I live in a constant state of ""I should have..."".  I have worked since I was a kid, except the past 15 years, which seemed to have flown by.  I am tired.  But, thanks to my laziness when I am not working, depression, and using substances to cope, I am soon to be at... something.I do not know why I am posting this or what I expect to come from it.  Life is tough for those born losers."
"I hate me, I want me dead.... But I'm not a killer...",I wish I was...
One day soon,"When my life is ripped away from me and back home I go over seas. I will see the end my final senses used to breathe. Salty bad blood within me. I will leave I will hear the waves of sound as I come crashing down. From a plane once I came, is how I'll leave and like a leaf. Ill fall with nothing but the ground to catch me. In my hand Ill have it open. A palm read and a destiny spoken. In the other taped together a seal unbroken. The release.. release and be it the ground I kiss or steel upon my lips, I will find my peace. One way or another I will fly I will fall, I will die.. Please God dont let me live again I should have never been given a second chance or a third. I will fly like a birdI will scream like a crowI will die a coward. Ill be free from this birth. "
I posted on here for help and received nothing but hateful comments and was stalked online,I was stalked and messaged on a personal account I didn't release to anybody and received derogatory messages. Guess that's what I get for trying to get help. If anything I feel closer to my goal now.
A note I wrote down after too much to drink,"Just a note I wrote down after I drank a little too much (still drinking). Not planning on anything drastic. Just want to.. I don't know, share? Get it out? Also I never post on Reddit so I don't know how to format to get it pretty.I was like this before my current jobI hate myselfI want to dieNothing is worth living for I'm in love with a certain girl for some reason even though I know she doesn't love me back. Pathetic. Why can't I get her off my mind. When I see/ interact with her I am happy. Why?I am worthlessI am a cowardI wish I was brave enough to end it allI'm too scared to seek help because I was suicidal and depressed as a teenager and didn't disclose it in my medic interview for my current job There's nothing else that I can do with my lifeI don't know what to do at work. I just make stuff up as I go and hope it's good enough.I try to find excuses to talk to the girl I like. I drink later and contemplate suicide because I shouldn't be bothering her. Why does she make me feel happy?I try communicating with people online. 99% of people don't respond. I find it next to impossible to hold a conversation with someone. Why is it so hard?How could anyone love me? It seems impossible. It is.I just want to end it. Please."
I think I should kill myself tonight,I've been trying so hard for 8 years now to start feeling better and nothing is working. The last remaining things that make me feel something are fading quickly. I spend all day in the void. There's no way out. I can't carry on like this.
I don't know guys. I feel like I'm not going to do anything about it today but what about tomorrow?,Often I feel like I'm doing okay and I'm surviving but then seemingly out of nowhere I get these (for lack of a better word) episodes in which I get absolutely crazy. It's like there are black tendrils clenching on my brain. All the thoughts I thought had left cascade back into my present and then even my memory betrays me. I feel fine now. But I just don't know what will happen if I have another bad one.
"Posted this on r/Depression, but I genuinely plotted out killing myself tonight. I think I'm going to do it.","I'm fucking done, I can't go on anymore. I'm a fucking disappointment and I'm too ignorant to do any of my fucking homework or anything that could inconvenience me in any way.
I feel bad for my fucking parents. They seem to care for me so much and I'm just an asshole to them. They support me in everything I do and I just yell at them and spend their money.
I lost all my friends at school. None of them ever talk to me anymore, I just bury myself in my room and play fucking video games and I just get so fucking bored sometimes but I just keep playing them because I know there's nothing else I'd rather be fucking doing.
All of a sudden I'm really fucking socially awkward and can't get a fucking girlfriend or any new friends it seems. I used to be fine talking to people and now I can't even hold a steady conversation with anyone, I just don't know what to say after a really short period of time.
I don't know, I could just be going through a really big mood swing but I genuinely feel like it would be better for me not to feel anything than to have to go to my stupid fucking school tomorrow and sit through my stupid fucking classes with teachers I hate and work that makes me want to burn the place to the ground.My thoughts on the ""It will get better"" are pretty narrow minded, I feel like that's some automated message that people just say in order to add some sort of reassurance to posts like this, because it will just get worse. The more i alienate myself the less my friends will be inclined to hang out with me not to mention that my grades are dropping and i can't push myself to try in school, so not only will nothing get better it will only get worse because i'll be forced to work in some shitty fucking job that i hate getting paid less than adequate for living just because i was too lazy to fucking do my work like everyone else and there's nothing i'll be able to do about it at that point"
I thought I could wait,"I always said that if stuff doesn't get better for me by the time I'm 30, I'd call it quits then. Recently, I have been feeling this overwhelming sense that stuff won't ever get better so I've decided to call it quits. Kind of sucks that life was never fair to me, but I suppose unfairness is a part of life. "
Just dont know anymore,"Maybe if I wasn't born with social anxiety. ��Maybe if I had more friends growing up.��Maybe if I could get minimum wage job.��Maybe if I had a car.��Maybe if I could find one girlfriend.��Maybe if I could be away from all the people and all the noise for as long as I needed.��Maybe if I had just one of these things I would'nt be thinking like this, maybe it won't last much longer. I just don't know anymore, I have no more answers."
30 and failed.,"Hello all.I'm worried I'm going to kill myself. 2 weeks ago I had a milestone birthday. 3 weeks ago my fianc̩ left me. She left because I lied. I was in debt and I concealed it for the entirety of our relationship. Out of fear. I'm a fucking liar. So I've reached this milestone age, and I'm newly single. I have nowhere to live. I'm bankrupt. I'm friendless. I have nothing. I get up in the morning, I go to work, I come home and I'm alone. I don't know what has compelled me to write this down. Maybe it's an exercise in catharsis. Maybe the narcissist in me wants someone to care. Or maybe I just need to reconsider.I've felt suicidal for years. But this is the most 'real' it's felt and I feel afraid. "
I have a gun and ammo but no balls.,"I just wish i could do it. I wish i could just pull the trigger and end it all, but im too damn scared. I live every moment of my life in pain, i donr want to be alive. But still i cant do it."
I turned 24 a few days ago and I already feel like a failure. I feel like I am too late and feel like I have no chance to survive in life. I feel like giving up everyday,"EDIT ....I know that everyone else has difficulties and maybe this kind of hardship feels too close to home to some but please, try not to just post 'This is so like me' becuase it is not helping at all'A few days ago I turned 24 but I was not excited to celebrate my birthday. In fact, I was horrified and even embarassed.This started to happen when I was around age 22-23 but I was already feeling like I was too late in life. Like I was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my life.I know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstacles.Basically, shit happens to everyone. A lot and most of them come unexpected.But I felt like this ever since I was a teenager - even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once, it is very impatient and wants things to be done There are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live in.I really wished that I had a grip in my life much earlier but I was a kid before - I was an idiot with no clear goal and well ... shit happened. Bullies, abuse and so much more and in the end, it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now I wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day, I keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me  that I allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move on.But I was pushed back in a way and I felt stuck for many years.I did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that I started to get a grip on my own life too late so I feel that I am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that I am too late and should already just give up Everyday, I keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me. Better grades, better income, better lives, better possible futures, more happiness, more confidence and so much more I feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future, afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do. Stuck because I feel like I have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painful.On the other hand, I am afraid of the future. I keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me. Should I study harder? What if I will not pass this test? Should I apply for a job already?It's extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move *(it's trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after you)(Honestly, I am 24 and I am still at university doing my bachelor degree. There are those days where I feel very embarrassed that I haven't graduated yet while people younger than me already did. And I know that I have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that I have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that I have the right strategy to tackle it if I ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing it.Most of the time when I make a mistake, I go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer self-criticism and I end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the process.Sometimes I even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how I look at myself and affected how I work and how I think during my studies How can I break this habit? What strategies I can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression, anxiety and EXTREME self-hatred and self-loathing and suicidal thoughts?How can I really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because I feel like I am at the bottom of the food chain and I feel like I have no chance to survive in life?Honestly, I often feel that I should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed. Many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and I feel that I was left behind and I feel that maybe I should just give up. I cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than I already have "
"everything seems like it should be great, but I'm lost, utterly confused, and I don't even know why I'm posting this. I'm married, with a 3 year-old, we both work and I feel completely alone. Not a close friend in the world and I'm just. So. Tired.","Been slaving away in kitchens for the last ten years. I have a good education, I just never got my degree. Cooked to pay the bills, etc. Found a great gal, got married, had a kid, got another on the way. Love my daughter - she's the best. But I swear to god everyday I wake up and go to sleep with the realization that no one is on my side. Sure, I'm good at my job, and the pay isn't terrible, but my boss treats me like a turd. I get home and tell the wife and she doesn't want to hear it - just wants to know that the checks are still coming. Along with the dental and healthcare.Starting to think she should just marry the company.I'm just a warm body/machine to the people around me but this body is sick and tired of putting up with all this shit. It isn't enough that I gave up on my hopes and dreams, it's not enough that I have no escape route that doesn't fuck my family over, it's not enough that I work until my whole body hurts the next day and I barely have the energy to walk the dogs much less be an active/caring parent, but as a man, I'm required to bottle it all up inside and pretend everything is great just for the benefit of those around me.I'm losing it. I am exhausted constantly and frankly, I work with a few great people, but lots of them are total idiots. I'm great at what I do but it's taken as a matter of course. Financial stuff is almost all fucked and we're always barely scraping by. I just want to give up. None of this is what I hoped it would be and I'm fed up with giving 100% everyday to everyone and getting nothing back but complaints. I'm angry as hell but I have zero outlet. No one is safe to talk to and I can't trust anyone. Tried talking to my wife and she just cried and swore and can't be supportive...she's just worried about money and our family. That's correct, of course, but the fact that my well-being doesn't even come second place....that hurts. I'd really like to cleanly, quickly end it all. I thought I had something valuable to bring to the world when I was growing up, but I see now that I'm just a broken-down cog in a really fucked up machine. Kitchens are lonely places, even though you're in everyone's ""personal space"" all day. i don't need a reason to keep going - I have plenty. But the parts are wearing down and getting it to turn over when i hit the ignition gets harder and harder everyday. I just want to lash out at something in righteous rage, but the targets are just shadows. "
"Probably not the most fitting sub, but in trying to get out of a rut, anything would help.","Starter note, I will likely not kill myself, I have strong ties to a dear friend who died, and it was the worst experience of my life. I would never wish this feeling upon anyone. His 21st birthday is soon, so death thoughts of course appear amidst the despair.But recently I was at a friends party, and I just couldn't deal with being there. I spent the entire time sitting in a corner alone. I was just too worried about too much other shit that was going on for me to enjoy it. But for some reason, as I looked out the window with T balloon weights next to me for some reason I kept having thoughts of grabbing the rock, smashing the glass, and then ramming a large shard into my throat. (As a note, I used to be a very violent person til this friends death. I bit many people during primary school, it was not pleasant)I was mostly scared of myself for thinking these things. I just hate being by myself because I keep thinking this sort of thing and panicking. (I recently kicked my window in a panic with the intention to break it, but I held myself back enough to cover my leg with a duna so I didn't injur myself. Just thought it was weird, seeing as I still broke it)"
this is how i imagine myself,"this is how i imagine myself. i imagine that i've stepped off the building that's lined in brick, inch upon inch above the ground, sky high, a million feet. i imagine my phone having numerous, frantic missed calls, but it's turned off. i imagine, as i'm falling, a remorse for anyone who ever really loved me, and fleeting thoughts of hatred for the people who think they do but only love what they think is me. i imagine regretting not writing anything before i go to tell them to shut the fuck up, and hope that in an afterlife i can haunt their asses. i imagine a splayed out kid in the parking lot, not moving, like a sack of meat, still and plopped down on the pavement. i imagine my black backpack, torn with wear because i refuse to get another backpack until the one im using is in tatters abandoned up atop the mall, carrying the government book that i was supposed to have read up to page twenty five in, my pink composition notebook, my three subject black spiral, my lime green accordion folder, my economics ook with a brown cover, my calculator, some pads, money, pencils, two plastic bags, all for thing i need to do later. i imagine darkness and revel in infinite discontinuation. i imagine nothing. "
I am tired.,"For the longest time I was the person who everyone went to if they wanted to vent or ask for help or just simply talk. The past few weeks have been very emotionally exhausting. I love hearing people out and helping them feel better, but I'm tired. I'm tired that everyone keeps telling me their problems and never bother asking me about mine. I'm like some kind of disposable toy that you get when you feel bad and get rid of it when you feel better.  I've been well for some time. But something's happening and I don't know how to control my emotions anymore. Every single thing triggers a bunch of negative emotions, including anger. Very bad anger. I get mad at others for messaging me with their problems and I don't want to feel this way. I don't  to kill myself but I do. It's weird to explain. Maybe I just want to be gone for a while. Run away somewhere and heal my soul. Sorry this is all over the place. I'm bad with my thoughts but I wanted to write this somewhere. I know how bad my thoughts and emotions can get and I was thinking of seeing a doctor about it. But I can't go there alone without parents and my mother didn't really care about this when I told her that I have some emotional issues. I'm very tired of feeling this way. I want to run away from these emotions but I can't. "
ready to off myself,"I'll be honest i always had an easy life. single child, parents have always been easy on me, loved to no end, it was unfair how easy i had it. Now i'm grown up and having to deal with life problems on my own tho and i have no guidance, no friends, no life, nobody. I'm getting my ass kicked proper and i can't deal with it, i can only cry. "
Soon,"I will be dead. No amount of anything can make me happy. Complete mental breakdown today and I felt completely ashamed. I had to go home and my parents grounded me from pretty much everything for 2 weeks. The internet, my phone. The only places were I can pretend to have friends. I'm ugly and stupid, failing 3 of my 5 classes. Last year of highschool and I can't do basic shit. It's a chore to live and the one thing that makes me happy is being taken away. Peace."
I feel like I've run out of options.,"Today is my twenty-first birthday and I want to die.My entire life is controlled by my family. They have all of my documentation and I have no way of recovering it for myself. I don't know my own SSN, and my birth certificate is long gone, but I have no way of ordering a new one because there's no way to prove I am who I say I am (I have no ID.)Without my information, I can't go anywhere. I can't leave.I had to drop out of high school due to severe anxiety that has turned into agoraphobia.A few years ago something terrible happened to me that gave me PTSD and made it impossible for me to work consistently, so I rarely have any money to my name.My family provides for me, but I don't want to live like this anymore.I haven't seen any friends in person for a long time because I need dental work on my front teeth and I'm embarrassed of showing my face to people.The few online friends I have haven't acknowledged my existence today and I just don't know what to do. Out of everyone I know, I'm the only one who doesn't have a job, can't start college, and didn't even finish high school. I need dental and medical care but I can't have it. I have serious mental health problems like PTSD and OCD that my family knows I have but won't get me treatment for.I don't want to die but I'm so tired of feeling like this I no longer think it's worth it to be here waiting for things to change. It's been five years, it's not getting better, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm just so tired of being so unhappy. I was hoping I could just ignore the day but here I am bawling my eyes out like a fucking child and I'm so disgusted with myself and I'm running out of reasons to stay alive."
All human beings are ranked,Sometimes it feels like all humans are on a coolness scale. Some people are cooler than I am and vice versa. The cool kids never give me the time of day and I can't help but find boring people boring no matter how well they treat me. That's probably why I'm always lonely and hate myself. It's way too fucking hard to change.
I can't do it.,I can't make friends. I can't interact with people more than few seconds. I get dizzy if I look someone in the eyes more than 3 seconds. No one will ever be my friend and no one will love me. I'm not even smart. I'm literally not good at anything. And I hate the way my body looks like.
I just don't know what to do with myself anymore [24 m],"**** This is going to be long and complex. I'm sorry and thank you in advance to anyone who reads it ****I've been severely depressed and have had severe anxiety/ADHD my whole life but it started to get really bad when I was 17 (I am 24 now). I never struggled in school grades-wise but I did every other way. I have one sibling, an older brother who is severely disabled. His health was getting worse while I was in high school through college. During this time I was also coming out of the closet as queer. Because of these things, I was getting no attention from my family, and i instead turned to drugs and drug communities I called my ""friends"" for support. I got arrested for possession twice but my dad just paid a lawyer to take care of it and nothing came of the arrests, all records disappeared. The whole process going through that was traumatizing though, as people like the police and probation officers were incredibly shaming and abusive. So the situation was taken care of but absolutely nothing was done for me to recover from the trauma, to figure out how I got into drugs in the first place, or what I needed to get better. My dad just told me to keep working/going to school and act like nothing happened, so I did. My brother's health took a turn for the worst after I graduated college and basically my parents are providing him 24/7 care for everything, pretty much just making him comfortable until he dies. This started like two and a half years ago. Doctors say it is impossible that he is still alive, but somehow he is, and we have no idea how long he'll survive. I didnt have a job after graduating so I moved home to figure things out. Being in that environment where my parents were busting their ass (and unable to get much medical support because of insurance red tape and USA's shitty health care system in general) to provide every single need to my brother (even feeding him and helping him go to the bathroom). I was just existing in the shadows being ignored. I tried to help out as much as I could but it was just so painful. It just sucked me deeper into a even darker depression. I started smoking marijuana and drinking liquor from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep every single day. I lost all control. I contemplated suicide very seriously and told my parents. They decided to send me back down to the town I went to college in. It's close to where my dad travels for work once a week so he got an apartment and just had me live there, he told me to go to the career center at my alma mater and try to find a job. All of my friends from college either moved away, stopped keeping in touch, or just got into fucked up situations, like one of my friends moved in with an abusive boyfriend. So i was pretty much just trapped here alone. Family only cared about me being okay enough to work. I turned back to the only thing I knew, which was substance abuse. I got connected back with the same drug communities and was in full swing of it again. I'm still doing it to this day. Even though I am severely depressed, somehow I am still highly functioning and skilled. I was able to find a job and I make good money now. It is an incredibly stressful job though, which just fuels the substance abuse even more, which puts me at risk of getting caught again and losing everything. I see a great psychiatrist but he is just as stumped as I am. I think what I really need is to be removed from my ""normal adult life"" and be in an environment where I can make my mental health my #1 priority and not have to worry about anything else. I feel like a monster being jealous of my brother because I wish my parents had the ability to take care of me until I get myself back on me feet. But I have an apartment lease, a car lease, and this job I don't want, I don't have the means of creating or finding that kind of environment I need. I spend all of my freetime drinking/smoking myself though bad emotional episodes because I am so stressed and in over my head. I can't go home because I'm afraid I'll become more depressed again.I honestly just have no idea what to do with myself. the only solution my doctor has is meds and therapy, which I've been trying on and off for years without any real luck. All I can really think about is offing myself. I just want nothing more than to just give up on everything. I know everyone at my age feels lost but I feel lost, alone, and unimportant. Like I could disappear and everyone would continue on with their lives. I am to the point now where I am okay with just being a sad tragedy people share on their Facebook pages and then move on with their lives."
I think time is running out,"I think I've failed on getting out of the hole that I found out I've been digging myself into years. So much of the advice I've heard won't help me. I don't really have the will or want to push through the next day, let alone year. I'm at the worst point I've ever been. If someone tells me I need to be strong I have the urge to curl up and tell them that it doesn't. I'm a weak, little person and it doesn't seem like making out is possible or even very rewarding"
It feels stupid to pick up the knife for a girl. But 6 years of pain and heartache seem to heavy to handle.,"When we 'fall in love' we're usually slaves to our hormones and primal instincts, which means we often become irrational. I know it causes pain, I've had the feeling before, however looking back on it I realise it was just not worth it. In my opinion, no girl can possibly be the ONLY meaningful thing in life. Hope things work out for you.  "
Why try?,"I�۪ve always been a pretty ���gifted�۪ kid, as far as most aspects go. I excelled in most classes aside from math from an early age, was pretty articulate even as a toddler, and used to genuinely enjoy learning before all of the enjoyment was sucked out of it by the pressure on me. My mom�۪s always held me to a standard of A�۪s and B�۪s only (even a C is failing in her book), and now I�۪m not meeting it. I�۪ve got too much work and I get it done, but I want to relax too. I don�۪t want to be doing something educational 24/7, because I�۪m too burnt out by the time I get home. I�۪m trying to bring my grades up, but I just can�۪t do it, and now my mom�۪s cold as ice to me and is taking away basically everything that gives me any sort of relief from the constant stress. She knows I�۪ve got depression and anxiety (both actually diagnosed), and she knows how she treats me isn�۪t helping at all, but she just doesn�۪t care. She says it�۪s all because she wants me to succeed, but if feeling like my own mother hates me and that I�۪ll never be good enough and having constant mental breakdowns and suicide attempts because of my failed attempts to meet her standards is what it takes to succeed, then I don�۪t want to. Why even bother if I�۪ll fail anyways? Why even bother trying to live a life that makes me wish I were dead? The only thing that�۪s really kept me here for almost 16 years is the thought of my friends and family, but I don�۪t care anymore. My friends can move on, and my mom�۪s just going to have to deal with losing her only daughter because of her refusal to listen. I try so hard to get help but there�۪s no use in talking if nobody will listen. Nobody aside from God himself could convince her to give me a chance, considering my dad�۪s already tried and so have I. So I�۪m not even going to bother anymore. I�۪ve already got a method planned, and a note, so I�۪m all set to go. I don�۪t need to be alive anymore, not with a life like this. I don�۪t want to graduate, I don�۪t want to go to college, I don�۪t want a job or a family or anything like that. If going through hell is what it takes to get that, then I never will. I can�۪t be alive anymore because this life isn�۪t worth living, and I�۪m practically already dead, just not physically. I�۪ve been attempting suicide since I was a fourth grader, believe it or not, but this time I�۪m going to make sure that it�۪s not an attempt. I may not be able to succeed at anything else, but I can and will succeed in dying.I know this sounds like typical teen angst bullshit, but I don�۪t care anymore. My whole life I�۪ve always been told that things get better, but they never have. The only way to make things better is to die. I�۪m tired of being the broken ���gifted�۪ kid. I�۪m tired of being alive."
I don�۪t know what to do.,"I want to die so badly but I�۪m too scared to end it which just makes me feel angrier about everything
It feels like everything I do is stupid and meaningless. Even if I work hard and find success financially, it feels like it would all be for nothing since nothing in life makes me feel any happier.
There is this burning in my brain that just won�۪t go away and I always feel like I�۪m being choked.
All I want is to go to sleep and not wake up the next day but I doubt that�۪ll be happening anytime.
Sorry if this is formatted weirdly, I�۪m on mobile."
What's wrong with me?,"So. It's been a rough day. And my boyfriend was refusing to call me. He finally did and his first words were ""what the fuck is wrong with you?""  As soon as he said that, I just lost all courage to tell him I was suicidal. I toned it down to depression and he was still irritated with me. But it got me thinking. What is wrong with me? I can't provide mentally for my family. I can't hold myself together. Something's wrong with me. I'm too weak. "
Is there someone I can talk to? Please!,"It's 2:00 am GMT in the morning in Southeast Asia. I've been crying for 3 hours straight. I hate my parents so much, I want to take 20 sleeping pills I've bought and die. It's a long story. I think every parents in this world fuck their kids up in a way they would never know. They are divorced  for 10 years now. My father is a selfish man, retired now, all he wants now is just money and alcohol. My mother is a rich woman, who can donate thousand dollars to homeless people but to her kids, no. Not that I want her money, but I won't be able understand that she know me and my brother still struggling to earn money, but she ignores it. Haha they could die now, I won't even shed a tear. Or I could die to end of my question: why I were born and have to watch them being unreasonable. Please note: I have a big heart, I care for a lot of people, i spend my entire life to keep their shit together for them, I am here for them the whole time to take care for the family business, and the house: cleaning, maintenance, trying to be happy around the house for baby kids,... but now I just want to kill myself or at least run away from them, but the only thing that hold me back is my baby nephews. I love them so much, I want to watch them growing up, I know once I run away from home, I will never want to go back see the shitty parents again, which means I can't see my nephews....I don't think I can bear with my situation for any longer. I can't stop crying... I need help... or someone I can call via Whatsapp/ Viber listen to me talking and crying... I have no single friend nor friends that actually friends..."
I feel so lost.. help me..,"I feel empty. like i cant get these thoughts and feelings to go away.. Im 21 and have been suffering with depression for the last 5 years... my life has involved my dad physically beating me, throwing, punching me etc.. my mums a alcoholic and they argue most nights. I did go uni but left after one year.. i work a shitty retail job, i have no friends, no outside communication, and i cant take it anymore.. the feeling of isolation.. the feeling of despair. Im so alone, i want it to end.. i cant remember the last time i was happy, ive had countless suicide scenarios run over and over in my head, its just doing it which is drawing closer..im scared.. alone..and above all need somebody..  "
My friend from a long time ago tried to kill himself,"I had a best friend all my childhood, but in our late teens we drifted apart. He did drugs, drank too much and was very pessimistic about life. In fact, that was true when we were friends as well, but I was more tolerable to it then. He has been posting extremely depressive things to Facebook for the last year, and a couple of months ago he told me he tried to kill himself. It was a huge shock, but I don't know what to do. He says he has no friends left and that life is really tough at the moment, also job and money wise.The thing is that, and I don't know if this is selfish but, I don't have the energy to hang out with him, or the strength to help him. I haven't seen and barely talked to him in over five years. He sees me as his only ""true"" friend in this world, and I know that if I start to hang out with him, he will be extremely clingy and desperate, wanting to do things all the time. When we did hang out, it was pretty draining, and back then he was way more stable than he is now. I just don't have the energy.I also know that saying this to him will probably push him over the edge. I also can't ignore him because that also feels mean under the circumstanses.What can I do?"
Illness causing suicide,...
overdose,are there over the counter medications that will give the easiest death.... where you can just fall asleep and not wake up? very unlikely and a silly question really but i'm curious.
Dieing is honestly the best option for me,Here's the situation. I'm about to age out of my parents health insurance and therapy is extremely expensive. I always feel alone. Like something is missing from my life. It's been this way for a long time. At this point I genuinely have nothing to live for. The only reason I haven't ended it thus far is because I can't think of a way where no one gets traumatized or hurt. Who would have thought ending it all would be so complicated.
I swear to fucking god if I GET FUCKING HICCUPS AGAIN.,FUCK APPLE. FUCK ANYONE WHO WORKS THERE. FUCK HICCUPS. FUCK EVERYTHING. EVERYONE THINKS IM SO FUCKING HAPPY. FUCK EVERYONE. I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. EAT SHIT. FUCK YOU.You think I'm fucking joking? FUCK YOU TOO. I SWEAR TO GOD IM BETTER OFF DEAD.
I just want everyone I love to know it isn't their fault.,"Funny how my first post on Reddit will be my last because I could never find the right words to properly fit in. I'm going to kill myself tonight. I've been thinking about doing this since I was 9 years old. I've run through the thoughts a million times over and at almost every angle I approach this, I am more than positive regardless of how long I prolong it, I am going to commit suicide so, why not tonight? I've lost almost everything that has ever meant anything to me. Regardless of the constant love and support I give others, it is almost as if no one can love me or just maybe can't love me at the capacity I love them. I feel like someone who is watching everyone else's life, but I'm never truly able to live my own. Just floating. Just here. I can't reach out for help, it's those dreams you have where no matter how loud you're screaming, kicking, hitting it just isn't enough for anyone to understand or come to your aid. The world won't end because I die. Time doesn't stop. Nothing spectacular will happen because I died. I will leave the earth as I entered if, crying. It's no ones fault that I was a prisoner to my own mind. The choice to end my life tonight is entirely selfish; I am destroying myself and everyone around me by being alive so I have to end it. I am sorry to whoever find me. I am sorry to my loved ones for being the way I am. I am so sorry and I loved you all very much. Take care of yourselves."
I'm homeless.,"I have a house that I live in but it does not feel like a home. When I am at work I am constantly thinking to myself that I want to go home, and then when I get to the house I still find myself thinking, I just really want to go home. I don't know where it is, though. Sometimes I go outside at night and walk around looking into all the empty businesses (I live by a busy highway) just so I can get away from the house. Sometimes I go to the grocery store or McDonald's or something and stay there for a super long time just so I don't have to be at the house, even if I don't need anything and even if I'm not even hungry, even if I'm down to my last few bucks at the end of my pay period (2wks). Sometimes I feel like I won't find my home until I go back to the place where I was before I was born, which is just nothingness. I just want peace and quiet and to be left alone. Does anyone else ever feel this way?"
I want to die but only for a while,"I'm a 15-year-old, I've been fighting depression for years, and recently I started wanting to not be alive, I don't want to kill myself, but I want to be dead. I don't want to be dead forever, maybe just like a week. is this considered being suicidal? I've been suicidal before, it felt different, I'm kinda confused."
Feeling like no one cares,"It's not that people haven't, they sure as hell seemingly have. But I don't... FEEL it. I can be making eye contact or hugging someone that I know cares about me... but I don't feel it. I've ruined so many friendships and relationships because they'd just reach a point where I felt like I didn't matter to them, no matter how much hell I'd put them through to prove otherwise. I've participated in groups and classes for hobbies, but again, I'd feel like no one cares about me, that it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not... even if reality is different...I'm 25. I've been seeing a therapist since March, trying my hardest to be vulnerable more and more, but I still don't feel like she cares about me. The disturbing thing is I do feel attached to her, I feel all the things one would feel when connecting with someone else. Except I don't feel like she cares... not really... no one cares... Why does this matter? Because I want to feel cared about... i want to feel loved... I want to matter to someone... I want to feel like there's actually reason to be part of this larger community called society. But I don't feel it... I'm just venting so I can get by until therapy on Thursday... thanks... I'm gonna tell her how I feel this way. "
A bucket list,"Lately my suicidal thoughts have become frighteningly specific. It's really sort of freaked me out. I was brainstorming ways to keep myself alive during those rock-bottom moments, and I decided to make a bucket list. All the things I want to do once before I die. Because my biggest problem isn't really the desire to die; it's a lack of interest with living anymore that really makes things dangerous for me. So hopefully a bucket list will be a kick in the right direction."
"Note to my mom, I love you","This is it, its the end of the road for me. The feeling of overwhelming sadness is unbearable, I think the world would be better off without me , nothing is worth breathing for, im just a waste of resources on this planet, the unmistakable feeling of being unwanted and hatred is fogging my existence, you may question my decision but please remember that human beings are complicated creatures,�� you may think I'm selfish for leaving this world without saying goodbye , leaving the people who loved me if any ,�� its not the easiest way to end the unlimited suffering I am facing , nor the smoothest��route to demolish the darkness of being lonely and rejected, please don't be sad that im gone , be happy that you meant the world to me."
"Hello, would you like to listen to me? I think If I talk for a little while I'll feel better. No pressure. It's just something that I want to try.",Sure!
im tired,i just want to jump off of a building. lately it has been very easy to be happy in one minute and suicidal sad after. smoking does not even help. alcohol does not even help. i cannot even go to a psychologist or psychiatrist because i dont want to burden my parents. i just want to die. im also going to die anyway.
"""that's life"" - then why live it?","This is the only thing people ever give me - tough love.All I think of when people tell me things like ""it's life, deal with it"" or ""it's your own fault"" or ""sometimes you have to deal with it and move on"".All I think of in my head is ""if this is life then, why live it?"".By giving tough love your giving me more reasons not to live. Which is helping me, but they don't realise they are making us feel worse. "
Looking at my crush having a fun time without me makes me want to kill myself,"Awww, that sucks dude :/Also saw my crush in class today, really hard to believe that you meet a person even hotter than her/him.
It's a stupid feeling, but what helps me are some hobbies right now: swimming,
 drawing a little bit or binge watch The Office, made me laugh big time xD.Something whats way more easier and appealing is try to let off steam or just chill by listening to some music, for me it's System of a down and Rammstein (they even have great calm songs), meet friends, drink and talk with them (maybe like ""This guy/girl is so hot, really fucks me up"") or watch porn, also an optionIt still sucks if you do those things but it helps until you find someone new to be attracted to."
I need solutions,...
yeah i might go trough with it this time,"failed another engineering exams i had put hours into to understand. Everyone hates me, looks down to me, thinks i'm retarded. I'm done, goodbye"
Every time I drink have the worst thoughts about myself and I don't even drink that often. I know I should keep it to only a few drinks and just be social about it. But I don't want my family to think something is wrong because I don't want to drink..I don't know what to do_��_,Could you tell them you have a new diet without alcohol and unhealthy things? This is all i could come up with.
I started self harming and I don�۪t know why.,Since secondary school I have suffered with anxiety and depression in and off. Recently (I�۪m now 24) I�۪ve been going through a really hard time again with my depression. A few nights ago I was feeling particularly terrible and for some reason I saw a razor on the sink in my bathroom and cut my arm. A few shallow-ish cuts running across my arm. The thing is I don�۪t really know why I did that. Why did I have the urge to that? I never have before? I don�۪t even know if it made me feel any better afterwards. I just wondered if anyone else could relate or has had the same feeling g could shed more light on it.
At my 25th birthday party I put a gun in my mouth,Everyone was downstairs having a great time. We were drunk. I couldn't stop thinking of my 12 gushed upstairs. It's camo with a camo case. It's loaded. It's calling me. I went upstairs and got the gun out. I stared at it. Then I put the barrel in my mouth. I stared at the safety. There is a round in the chamber. I took the gun out of my Mouth and set it on the floor. I shook for a little while. I managed to pull myself out of it and tell my wife. It's been a few days now. I'll never forget the taste and I'm so ashamed

What's the point when there is no advancement?,"Life isn't improving at all. I thought moving and getting this new job would fix a lot of problems but I'm still homeless after a year of being here. I can't afford anything. Keeping busy doesn't fill the hole in my heart either. I have no family left alive and no one I'm close to. I just work, make enough to survive and pay my Y membership so I can have a place to shower and I sleep in my car. I really don't know what to do to improve my life. I'm too stupid for college. I have a learning disability that not only prevents me from furthering my education but causes me to be the butt of almost every joke in whatever group of people I find myself in. I miss my family all the time and not having a roof over my head, being able to buy decent clothes or go do anything that would be interesting to me has made life not worth living to me. I'm ready to die. "
Every Goddamn Day,"Every goddamn day I fight it. Every day I have convince myself that impaling myself into something sharp isn't with it. Every day I come up with an excuse. ""You really want to see that concert"". ""You have a trip soon"". Sometimes I drag the bottom of the barrel. ""You just did your hair"". ""The weather looks nice tomorrow"".I have toyed with that line. Still do. I have held the sharp thing in my hand and felt the cold. Imagined so realistically the intake of breath as I push past the resistance point of flesh. Always into my chest. Always.Everyday I put it down and walk away. Every fucking day. I have no idea how long it will last. Thirty-six years so far.I don't post this for a response. Won't even answer if you do. I just needed a place to say it. To put it out there. I will save myself. I always do.Every. Fucking. Day."

I need to die.,I need to die. I need to die. I need to die. I need to die. I need to die. I need to die. I need to die. I can't fucking do this anymore. Nothing matters anyways. I need to fucking die. I can't step outside without feeling vulnerable. I can't sleep in my own house because my roommates stay up until 5 am drinking and being loud as fuck. Sleep is the only reprieve I have. I need to fucking die.
Getting into a partial program is impossible,If you weren't just hospitalized. Guess I gotta go attempt again. So much for trying to get better
I feel so stuck,"This isn't the most urgent post so you can skip over this if you want.
I'm 17 years old, white male and american. I'm ugly and lazy. Everyone at my school dislikes me, and for good reason. They would hate me but no one gives enough of a shit about me to muster enough energy to hate me except myself. I've been in therapy for 4 years now, it may have helped some in the past but now I've realized that I can never change myself no matter how much I want to because I'm a lazy piece of shit, I'm so fucking full of myself and full of self pity. I hate my guts. I wish I was dead. I've been waiting for so long for things to get better but they haven't and I don't think they will in the future. Whenever I get a test back at school I don't look at the grade because I'm too anxious, I told my mom this and she got angry at me and tried to make me look at it. I know one test is a tiny thing but it means so much more, it's a sign of all the shit I fail at, all the projects I've begun and never finished, all the first paragraphs of my ""great novel"" I've written and then forgotten about for six months only to cringe at later, all the times I've tried to learn another language or read a book and failed because I'm such a fucking piece of shit. Wow look at that, more fucking self pity. shocking. I can't do anything, I have no willpower. This test, this one fucking test is just one part of a million things that make me want to just not be anywhere any more. I used to have this friend, she was my girlfriend too for a while, and she was one of the few people that made me feel good and wanted, she made me feel happy because I felt for the first time like I was making someone's life better. we broke up but agreed to be friends afterwards, and she went from having a crush on everyone of my ""friends"" ending on my only real friend before this. he told me that he didn't like her, and after listening to rave about him and trying to get him to date her, I told her this.
I'm such a fucking dick.
She told him about what I said, and now he hates me for telling her, and she hates me because she thinks I lied.
I guess I did, my intentions don't matter.
So now the only two people that maybe cared don't anymore. this all happened today. I don't know when I'll kill myself, but I know that that's the most likely way I'm going to die. I used to think I couldn't because I could give something to the world but now I realize that I'm not shit but a self pitying piece of garbage. I just want to not be here anymore, stuck.Thank you for reading this if you did, though I'm sorry for wasting time that could be spent helping other people who need it more."
Been thinking about it for a while now,"Suicide, yeah. I wanna die. I wake up and I'm upset that my eyes opened again. Everything I liked has become so insignificant to me in the past few years and life is just a hassle all the time. Y'know, I understand people have their problems, that there's gonna be obstacles pretty often, but I'm here thinking, ""Wow, fuck this. What's the point?"" I'm only 21, I'm a full time student who is also employed, I'm pursuing the career I want - but a big part of me tells me none of what I want will ever happen.
I'm a girl, and I hate it; this culture is so shitty toward this gender and it takes absolutely everything in me to not reek havoc on society every motherfucking day. Men look at me like they want to eat me and I'm just so uncomfortable walking down the street. I can't even work without a gross older man looking me up and down and flirting with me. My skin crawls every time.... gah
People tell me they are here for me but I cannot bring myself to talk with them. I don't want to be hospitalized because that's gonna put everything (like SCHOOL) on hold, and I don't want that. It's like there are solutions but I cannot use them.
Things aren't going so well right now. My future is at risk because of a stupid decision I made to ""help"" with my depression - but now consequences are obviously not worth it and I'm pushed to seriously kill myself because I'm prone to make stupid decisions ALL THE TIME just fuck me, right? I should googogogoGO...but I'm here."
I do not know what to say here.,I have no idea what to say or do. I am just so worn out and tired and I don't know that I can keep this up. I live my life pretending to be happy and faking smiles for the people in my life including work.  I walk around and pretend things are great and that I don't hurt. I have no idea what I am trying to get out of this post to a bunch of internet strangers but I have nobody else. Damn it I just wish people would understand how bad I hurt. The only thing that keeps me from just ending it is my selfishness of trying to make everyone around me happy if that makes any fucking sense. I want to talk about what hurts and where I come from but as I type this I don't know if it would change anything.
Parents. Threatens to destroy my college/job career.,"I feel the need to jump off a bridge and just drown my sorrows in the abyss. Due to family issues, regarding me in general, due to my sadness in anger fusing together as a time bomb ready to explode into a Sea Mine size explosion. So here what's happened: My Mother and my Aunt, both says if I don't pass this Algebra Tutorial Final Test for college which is a 70% (Currently staying at 60-65%) they'll force me to go back home to find a job. So, why shouldn't I stay since, I'm clearly 18 and allowed to do whatever I need to do here, then back there. My Major is Computer Game Designing, if I can't find a effort to create games, I can't live with myself anymore. It's like they say ""You Lose one, your parents wants you to lose many"". Asian parents... they guess they knows what's best right? Wrong. I want Happiness, freedom, and be treated as a equal to an equivalent of a friend. Though, going out on the interstate bridge hoping to drop to my death, will be pleasant enough. Seriously, who thinks they were just making a false claim on saying ""That excuse is a lie, they won't do that"". Well sorry bud, but my parents is something I can't opposed to. I mean like that Sincerely, Cause if no college means no way of pursuing my career just end it, erase my existence it's useless once they made my decision on something they opposed to, they will carry me off to homebound."
My Mother Birthed Me Only to Kill Me,"Not directly, but every one of her actions since I was like 16 has made sure I was the most miserable I could possibly be. I hate her and she's the #1 reason I want to die; because I'm so ill it's unavoidable to have her in my life because I need money but as long as she's in my life I have zero hope of getting better. I hate you Mom. Why do some people get the most sorrow-creating and terrible parents_��_She doesn't care if I live or die. I've read her emails (yep, I suck) and she says she's not even sad about my life anymore, just waiting to move to another country and not deal with me. I told her I was going to kill myself on a specific day and she made sure to leave the house that entire day giving me the opportunity to do it. She's given me so much stress and trauma I literally have severe chronic pain from the emotional abuse and cruelty she's put me through. I don't want any replies, just venting."
Putting it here,"I'm putting this here instead of advice because it seemed more fitting. It is more fitting.
I've started high school. I deal with many things that make me feel very upset. School is just another thing I have to deal with upon my pile, and it's the worst of all. I don't know why exactly I don't like it. I mean, many people don't like high school, or any school for that matter, but school, no matter how much they try to help me deal with all my problems, It makes me want to harm myself in a terrible way.
I just don't know what to do. I don't want to spend the next four years of my life feeling suicidal, I want to spend it wisely, taking online school, where the environment is less stressful, and I won't feel as depressed. I'm thankful they try to help me, but I've been pushed to my limit and I can't handle this.
My parents don't like the idea of online school. They keep telling me to try. Everyone thinks I'm getting better, but I'm not. I'm just getting better at hiding it. How in the world do I tell them or convince them that I won't be as depressed being schooled online?  And I know I'd be happier doing that because I've been seeing how I feel at school and as soon as I come home. It changes drastically. In a good way.
Please help me."
I�۪m going to kill myself. I�۪m tired of life,"I'm tired too man. I don't want to study, I don't want to have to exercise. I don't want to be addicted to nicotine, I don't want to be antisocial. I don't want to feel like I'm being watched in public. I want to feel like I belong. I don't want to get a job. It's my second week in college and I already feel as if I'm fucked. But what else can I do? Join the military? I'm fat and lazy, and enjoy pot too much. No military in their right mind would take me. I hate having to get out of bed everyday. I hate parties, I hate being awkward. The only few things I enjoy are history, money, video games, and weed. I've never been suicidal, but I definitely scare myself. Everyday a single thought dawns on me. ""It'd be easier if I was dead."" I wish we were all just stupid goddamn animals. I wish algebra didn't exist, I wish we could just fuck and die like everything else "
Is it worth committing suicide because I can't find a job and I'm legit unemployable wherever I go?,Seems like all my friends who went through the same struggle as me for years all have good paying jobs now and I'm just completely useless staying at home with my parents just wanting some money. Fuck DOING MY HEAD IN.
"Why can't I just go to sleep, forever?","I was diagnosed with insomnia, it's not bad at all, a few mg (15mg to be exact) will knock me right out.I wish it put me to sleep forever, maybe one night it will, if I take 100mg."
I ruined everything with the person I love,"It all happened when we were on vacation from college. She had an argument with her mother and her mother took her cellphone, so we weren't able to comunicate. After some days, I thought she was just busy, and only sent her 2 messages. But, after a while, I began to think that she didn't want to talo with me anymore, and I started feeling depressed. I didn't have anyone to talk during vacation, because my best friend was really busy(and she got even busier later, so I just spend all the time I'm not at college in my room), so we didn't talk at all. After a while, I just felt horrible, each day that passed made me wanna die more and more. After some time, she appeared and told me she was without a cellphone, and disappeared again. By the time she told me that, everything had lost its charm to me.
When we returned to college, she was acting really strange, she was ignoring me, and broke up with me. After that, she blocked me on everything. By each day that passed I was feeling more depressed, I started really hating myself, and I didn't even feel any pleasure from going out with my friends anymore. I can't concentrate on classes anymore, and everytime I tried to talk with her I just wasn't able to see what I had done, as I was feeling really confused. Everytime I see her, I wanna talk with her, but I just feel paralyzed when I try. We see each other everyday. It has been 2 months since we broke up, and I really can't take it anymore. I just plan on ending it all on the weekend, but I wanted to at least apologize first..."
"If things have not improved by the end of the month, I think it'll be time to move on","My depression is getting worse, the medication isn't working, I don't feel anything except fear of being reprimanded by authority figures or having the few friends I have left leave me for reasons unknown. Life seems to be a feelingless purgatory. Even those friends I have are often angry with me. I'm alone most of the time. Dreams of my fears coming to fruition prevent sleep from being respite. I suddenly feel like I'm  acomplete nihilist, and I think that ifthings don't seem to matter by the end of the month, I reckon i'll go jump off a bridge. Main reason i'm waiting is lostallhope recommended it.Nobody that i know of benefits from my existence. I don't even benefit, as I'm a constant dissapointment to myself for my failure o live up to my ideals, do basic chores/activities, or een just getting up and showering. A porn addiction that had been put to bed for a ear or so hit hard in the wake of this, and it just makes me feel emptier and more disconnected from the world at large.Sorry for the crap spelling. i was half asleep while writing."
I can't anymore..threatening.,"I am a 18 year girl..going to school and I used to live my parents but then got my own house living with my flat mates. I couldn't live with my parents anymore because I used to be bullied by them, they didn't allow me to go out with anyone not even with aunt or smth like that.. but today my dad came to visit me and started threatening me that he wants to cut my neck open telling me to wash dishes do the work for him and if I say 'I don't want it' he is always coming with a knife and showing me the way he is going to murder me.. he is non-stop insulting me I am thinking to do drugs.. I even started cutting because I don't know anymore he's been alcoholic since I can clearly think and I tried 18 years to deal with it. I cannot handle this any longer and I will commit this week, people do not know about it but that text should be my last text to say that I love my family still but I just want to thanks people supporting me and tried to go through this with me, my boyfriend I love you.
thank you for reading this guys, appreciate all of it. "
Thoughts,"I think about doing it every day but I am a coward and dont know how to. But I wish I could. I wish I could easily end it. I think about the people who it'll hurt. My family, but that's a given. I think about all the people who will pretend to care. Like friends from high school or people who I've talked with once or twice. And then I wonder why will they care then? Is it so other people can show them sympathy because they ""lost a friend"" or is it to make themselves look like they are caring? No one talks to me now, why not put effort into caring while I'm still here instead of when I'm dead. All I think about is haunting their asses tbh. All the ones that may pretend to care. "
I want to reach out to somebody but if they don't understand or realise how serious I am what do I do?,"How should I feel if I reach out to somebody for help Irl  but they don't realize how serious I am or they just aren't emotionally equipped to handle it???Also if that does happen and I still decide to go through with it how can I let them know it's not their fault for being ""unprepared"" or at all for what I did?"
Please hear me out,"This is my first time on this subreddit, but I think is time for me to seek help. (Before going on, please read everything, I know It's long but I really need someone to hear me out).I'm currently a 20 yo male, so I'll start writing from the beginning.
It all started back when I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend whose name was Fred. Fred was always there for me and he was a great friend for pretty much all my life. He bid farewell when I was 17, needless to say, I cried all that day.My first episode with depression was back when I was 14 I think, I got expelled from my previous school and entered a new one (I had a lot of behavioural isssues back then), so I felt abandoned and like I had betrayed the friends I had; not only that, I aso felt I disappointed my mother (this was the second time I was expelled).But Fred tried to cheer me up! He did his best so I wouldn't be sulky all day long, and I even met a guy (he was the first persona I talked to in that school) and was really happy for the first time! I thought everything would get better from then.However, the next day I went to school, I didn't find that guy anywhere. Needless to say, I felt devastated. Had I done something wrong? Did I scare him somehow? All those doubts were bugging me back then. Some years later, I found him again (I met other people and made new friends while looking for him), and asked him why he had disappeared. He told me he didn't like our classmates, so he changed his classroom (he felt terrible when I told him how I felt, to this day, he still feels bad for what he did. But I've got no grudges against him).So, I was all alone during my first year at that school. With the exception of that single kid, I didn't get along with anyone else, so that year I was friendless. I used to help my arts teacher do some works during the breaks, so I wouldn't be alone all day long (I learnt the hard way the value of human interaction), otherwise, I would be reading in the hall (I've done this since I was a kid).One day, I was unbearably sad, so I didn't feel like eating anything, also, you had to go to the dining hall so you could have lunch, and I skipped lunch for a whole week, cause I didn't want to go alone in there and be seen as a weirdo (I was an idiot, I know).So I stopped eating for that week, got some nasty hunger pangs and ate as much as I could when I got home, I also ate a lot during the weekends, so my mom became suspicious. One day, I was feeling really, really hungry, since waking up, so I ate my snacks. It eased the hunger pangs for a while, but during spanish class (that teacher really liked me), I passed out.I obviously don't remember everything, I was sitting in my desk and lost consciousness. Next thing I remember, everyone was standing by my side, looking at me, someone went for stretcher, and they carried me to the school's nursery.I stayed there for a long while, and when I got out, another teacher that really liked me (I'm still indebted to her, if you're reading this, thank you), greeted me. She began asking me questions, beating around the bush until she told me: ""So you say you've been eating well, but I can prove otherwise"". She showed me a list they used, which they checked when you entered the dinig hall. I didn't have a single check.She said she wouldn't tell my parents (I begged her not to), if I went to eat everyday, I agreed and to this day, my parents don't know about that incident.Fast forwarding to college life.I decided to study medicine, and entered college when I was 17. Everything was fine, I still was sad cause of Fred's departure (he left when I was 17, remember). But I was really happy for the change of environment.Until one day... I was having lunch at the dining hall, and saw a guy; who I thought was cute, but said: ""Hey it's fine, you can find other people attractive, doesn't mean you're gay"". I was wrong, I had a crush on that guy (I still kind of have to this day).I was really confused back then, so I experimented with a different guy who liked me (I didn't reciprocate though). It was a terrible idea, not only I felt bad for him, I was struggling with my sexuality, and that triggered another depressive episode.Last year, I finally came out to myself as bisexual. I decided I needed to move on (the guy I like has a boyfriend and has been with him for 2 years I think), so I decided to talk to him. I got really nervous, and didn't tell him how I felt (but I think it was pretty obvious from my body language). To this day, I still kind of have feelings for him. I know it's ridiculous, we haven't even talked except for that time! But I'm not jealous of his boyfriend, I hope they stay in love and have a healthy relationship.If you're still reading this, thank you! I really appreciate it.And now, to the present day.I've been having suicidal thoughts for some time, actually I even have it planned (I study medicine, so I know that's a warning sign).I haven't done it cause I promised Fred not to do it, and he told me that if I kill myself, he wouldn't talk nor come see me again.
I know I should go to a psychiatrist, but I don't want anyone in my family to know about this.Thanks for reading this! I know it's long but I needed to write all the important details. Any help is really appreciated, please be safe and have a nice day/night!"
This is my (20F) last cry for help.,"I can't believe I'm here again. I wrote on this subreddit about 6 months ago and didn't think that things could be worse.Here is that post in case you're curious: I've really had enough.I'm lonelier than I've ever been. I don't have anyone to talk to and saying I'm overwhelmed is too much of an understatement. I really need help because I don't want to feel this way anymore. I can't type anymore, my mind is racing."
I'm scared and I feel alone,I hate being so edgy and stuff but I'm so sad and I don't know what else to do. I just want to be okay and have everything turn out all right. I'm scared and I just want help.!
I'm done with it all,I'm so alone. There is absolutely no one out there for me I get so much plastic surgery to make myself substantial looking but still no one will ever want to actually be with me because they know how incompetent and disgusting and What a worthless piece of shit I am. I deserve nothing. I am thinking about driving down to this infamous neonazi house downtown because I want to get raped again it's what I deserve even my psychiatrist thinks I'm a worthless piece of shit it's time to go
"On, and off","I've been here a little too much for my liking the past few months. But.. I just feel so lonely. It's very on and off, but it's really on right now. Everything. The anxiety, depression, I don't know. I just feel so lonely and tired. I had a plan a couple months ago, on how I'd do it. I still have it.. I don't want to. I really don't want to. I just.. have about 3 friends and those 3 friends are always busy. I feel so lonely. I'm sorry if I'm repetitive. I'm just so done."
What now,"Missed another day of work, missed another assignment.   I think in actually finding the downward spiral that will get me to finally kill myself."
Why do i bother,I went out with a friend to just try to get out and I'm not even socializing with anyone. I wish I could just kill myself. Maybe I'll finally do it. I wanna do it.
Can't sleep,"Because I'm too busy of fantasizing of how I should do it. I'm just tired of all the bullshit I'm feeling. I'm tired of the messed up place that's my head. I'm tired of how much of a fucked up
Horrrible person I am. I don't deserve anything and idk why I'm here. "
"There's only one reason I haven't killed myself yet, and it's not a very good one. (CW: rape)","When I was 17, I was raped.  He was my boyfriend at the time.  He'd done something, asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday, or something like that, and it had disgusted me.  I didn't want to have sex with him that night, but ""no"" was not an answer he liked to hear.  Previously, when I'd said ""no"", he just got me drunk, but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until I gave in, because I felt like I had to.I had a history of being abused before that.  My family was not a good one.  He knew this.  He had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends.  He knew there was nobody else in my life, and he knew that gave him power.
I cried the whole way through, and even though he didn't ""finish"", because ""it really started feeling like I was raping you, and I'm not a rapist"", that didn't erase the previous... fifteen or so minutes, if I remember correctly.  He didn't stop for me.  He stopped for his own self-image.To this day, he is the only person I have had sex with, willingly or otherwise, and that's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet.  I don't want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me, it feels like he's winning.  Especially since it's been over half a decade since it happened, and I've still not been able to be with someone else.I feel like that's slowly becoming less and less of a concern though.  Nobody would want me now anyway.  I have no life in me, there's nothing about me that would attract another person.  I recently realised, after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me, that I could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticed.I don't know why I've not done it.  Maybe I'm scared of the pain of failure."
"I'm Self-Destructive and Volatile, Should I Just Do It?","I'm not forcing anyone to see my past posts, but I'd recommend the last few just to understand how self-destroying and volatile I am. It's probably nothing compared to what some people become suicidal about, but hey, it's that.Now, I've had suicidal tendencies way before today. I have depression and take meds and all that shit, and they really work if I never actually think about my own situation.And today I did. And I'm beginning to regret not just ending it back when I first attempted suicide a few years ago. The amount of pain I would've went through these last years is fucking tremendous: my mother died, my dad is paranoid I'll do something, my sister disappointed in me dropping out - I'm a fucking mess. I just want to end it, to be forgotten about, to throw myself into a river of liquid space and disappear beneath the waves.If I did not exist, my mother would be alive. I'm sure of it. She was an alcoholic and died from a ruptured liver. Dad said she only started drinking when she had two children to look after, of course not implying that I was the problem.But I am. Growing up, I was a shit to take care off. Asperger's and mood swings are all what I remember myself as a child. Considered bright to some regard, but now I wish I could swap out my ""brightness"" with something more practical, like charisma or something that would really help me socially. Now I've dropped out of high school, going to a technical college for some diploma I only decided to work towards because it was practical and literally the only thing that would get me a job (IT).I'm a self-pitimising shit and don't deserve the life assigned to me. I want to connect with people but end up driving them away unintentionally. I get angry, passionate, emotional - but people don't like people like that. They want some sugar-coated bullshit phony-ass ""yes please, no thank you"" person who sticks their finger in their ass and zips their mouth up.I'm not important.I'm just not fucking important.If I disappeared (not die, just stopped existing), nothing would change. It won't be the next fucking big headline ""TEEN BOY WENT MISSING"", all I'd get is a little fucking corner of some shitty fucking tabloid magazine. If I was younger or a girl however, you bet your fucking ass people would type that shit up.Because guys can't be emotional. Guys' problems are nothing compared to girls. We should just shut up and listen to people yap on and on and on and fucking on until they look at us expectantly, waiting for our dry-toned old-style-radio-static-type voice, replying near a whisper, ""Tell me more.""And that person will smile, knowing full well that you aren't really listening, but appreciative of the fact you would bend your own arse for them. Then yap yap yap yap...""Tell me more.""Yap yap yap yap.""Wow, really?""Yap.Every god damn time I try to be open, I try to say my thoughts on something, someone always has to bring me down. I get it, I'm the Yapper. But why should I be so fucking subservient to people when they don't return the fucking favor? Fuck that. I regret every minute I spend talking about something deep within me, a desire tangled in cobwebs of barbed wire, as I soon regret it. It's the same everywhere: online, offline. It's like I've already died and went to Hell, and have been spending the last seventeen fucking years just waiting for Satan to pop out of nowhere, shout, ""You just been pranked!"" and then having everything around me collapse like fake walls in a movie set.Fuck this, I'm not waiting for anyone. If it is going to end, I'm going to fucking do it, whether it is today or in 100 years time. Even if I stop being depressed, get married, live a happy life, I'm dying by my own hands. I'm not giving cancer, diseases, ANYTHING taking this one part of my life that will be under MY CONTROL. I was always like this. I never had control over my mind. One minute I'm in complete control, the next it's like both arms have been cut from the shoulder and I'm in the backseat of a car driving a hundred miles an hour toward an open active nuclear missile silo. The only choice I have is to close my eyes.FUCK. I'M JUST SO FUCKING DONE WITH ME. I WANT TO BE SOMEONE NOT ME. AND HEY, GUESS WHAT? I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, DESTROYING ANY REPUTATION I GAINED AND THEN THROWING AWAY THE ACCOUNT. AND I'M PROBABLY GOING TO DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ADN AIGAN AND AGAIN.I wanted to be a writer, I wanted to be a games developer, I wanted fucking anything that isn't me right now. But I've realized that I'm stuck here, in limbo, probably for centuries. I've talked to councillors, therapists, the whole lot and they all say the same, ""Tell me more."""
The harder I try the further I fall.,"I was diagnosed with chronic depression pretty early on, I think around 12 or 13. Diagnosed with bipolar when I was 19, and BPD when I was about 24. And PTSD about a year ago. I am now about to be 29 in a few weeks and I have been stuck in the worst depression of my life since this past December. I had been In a depression before that but I�۪d come out of it within days. I can�۪t come out of it this time. Its been almost 10 months! I don�۪t have the desire or will to live anymore. No I do not want to kill myself nor do I have a plan. but it�۪s like my brain has become hardwired to just constantly obsess about suicide. It�۪s almost like I welcome the darkness lately. I haven�۪t even been able to get into a manic state in probably a year. This is detrimental to me. I could paint and make the art I love to make when I am manic. My artwork was my outlet and I�۪ve lost that spark. I actually felt happy, and content. I actually live my life and get shit done. With my depression comes the most god awful anxiety I�۪ve ever experienced. It�۪s crippling, and it affects my home, relationships and work life.  I�۪ve tried multiple medications and they only make things worse. I actually got started on a new one today. Basically the reason I am writing this is because today.. I have been in the worst place mentally than I think I�۪ve ever been. I lost it today. I had to move in with my family last December after my breakup, I was suppose to be getting money saved and bills paid off. My depression kept me from doing that. Well, now, as of four weeks ago today my checks began to get garnished by a hospital here in town for thousands of dollars. Well, Today I get a summons for court because that same hospital is suing me again for another bill that is thousands of dollars more than the garnishment happening right now. And about a week ago I get a letter from the IRS stating I�۪m being put on a levy or pay 500$ immediately. And then find out my car has an issue that needs addressed immediately before the axel breaks and that could cost around 600-800$ I�۪ve been struggling living paycheck to paycheck so I had no savings and I literally got paid today and have less than 20$ to last�۪s me another two weeks. I�۪m trying like hell but the harder I get pummeled the more I want to give up. I know I am strong and I know I am capable of shit I can�۪t even imagine but I�۪m reaching my breaking point. My body is small, it can only take so much. The constant self hate and self destructive behaviors destroy me. It�۪s like I won�۪t allow myself to be happy. I feel like that ���happy�۝ feeling doesn�۪t exist inside me anymore.  Why are we so frowned upon when we want to end our pain and suffering? I get that people will be hurt by it and miss us but staying is torture. I can�۪t even enjoy being around family and friends because I�۪m so lost in my head. My anxiety causes me to panic and then Everyone thinks that I am upset. I ruin people�۪s good vibes when I bring my bad vibes around. So we are expected to stay and be miserable and horribly pained just so they won�۪t feel the sting from us going elsewhere. Isn�۪t it selfish on both ends?  I don�۪t want to exist in this world but I don�۪t want to die.  Suicide haunts my mind and we are becoming a little too comfortable with each other.  ���I am strong, but I am tired�۝"
Feel like I need to have it as an option,"I'm not sure where I should post this since it deals with multiple things, but I will just post it here because it could be triggering and it is related to suicide. I keep obsessing over the thought of friends committing suicide. Whenever they feel low or seem off, I get anxious. Now, I get anxious when they are physically unwell as well (because I don't want to lose them and that is the first thing my mind goes to when I hear they aren't feeling great physically), but I noticed the kind of anxiety is very different. I think I have now finally figured out that that is because I feel like if they commit suicide, then I ""can't"" anymore since I will be seen as an attention seeker. Thus, I feel like I don't have the option anymore, and I will feel nervous*. Sometimes it even makes me feel like I have to commit right now because otherwise I won't be able to do so anymore. It drives me insane that I keep obsessing over these thoughts/other people's wellbeing because I feel selfish, and I also don't want them to feel upset, and by thinking about this (and being unable to stop doing so) I can literally ruin /anything/ for myself. *I also feel anxious because I don't want them to be upset - even if I know they won't commit suicide, I will just want them to be happy and I also just really don't want to lose them. I think the obsessing part is very much OCD related, and the keeping it as an option part is depression related, but I have no clue how to solve this regardless. I'm not sure what I want with this post. Just get it off my chest, I guess. "
Can you choose what happens to your body?,"Is there a way I can leave instructions of what I want to be done to my body when I kill myself, or will it go automatically to my closest relatives?I could also leave some cash to cover what I want done.I want my ashes burnt and thrown into garbage dump or pig farm. I would also want zero funeral or any similar event.This would be in north america if that matters..thanks"
I want to scream out on facebook that i don't want to live anymore,"but i have friends who have been suicidal and i don't want them to have flashbacks to their attempts one time one of them asked me if i was going to be safe. i lied and said yes because i know she has anxiety. later on that night i tried looking to see if there was a hatch leading to the top of the building my office is in (there isn't, but there's a way to open the door leading to a locked patio on the seventh floor of another building)i feel so terrible.even now, there are things that I want to say but I won't because I know that they might upset some of you. the only person i can tell would be a therapist.who would then call the cops or the ambulance.fuck. if i ever do it there's a long trail of social media posts that will foreshadow what i've done."
I know I'm ready because i don't feel anything,"I'm not scared and I'm not sad. Not angry either.  No aching in my chest or tears. I guess some people just weren't meant to live, and I accept that I'm one of them. "
I don't dream anymore,"[repost after problem with automatic mod]I feel fatigued all the time.
College is fine.
Internship in a department of my university is fine as well (I got lucky, 'cause the architecture field can be really harsh). But even on it, my mindset is in a place where I feel bad though the process of doing something and not succeeding, the calling out session that comes after and, even when I get praised over something, I don't really care. Whatever. I have no idea what I'm going to do after I graduate because I'm not sure, 4 years in, if I have the right skillset for architecture. And I don't think I can mentally and financially change my graduation at such stage. I've seen so many incredible people who deserves so much mor the title of ""architect"" that can do so much more than I ever could.I used to have a hard time opening to others while I was young due to insecurity. That developed to a stage where I get my fix of social accomplishments in my own world, in my head. Imagining traveling and dating. Sure, I have a nice and welcoming group of friends, open minded, the best people you could ask for. And yet I can't come out to them as gay because there's this cliff in front of me where I freeze and can't afirm myself. Oh, and I had unprotected sex and am on . So hey, I'm feeling even more shitty!And I'm progressively losing interest in things. I'm not caring about carrer anymore. I have a crush at college, which could really work. But I'm too tired to go through the dating process. So I imagine moments like holding hands and I'm done with the human affection part.I'm watching videos of families who lost someone to suicide. In the past, it was shocking to me, so it kinda got me away from this path. But every time I go back to them, I get more and more numb towards them. Everything is a drag. God, even thinking about te process of getting the stuff to end this ""situation"" is tiring. Exit bag would be a must cause of pain, but I have to go after materials and stuff.I currently live with my mother, but I'm getting further from her every day. My bedroom's door is closed all the time, my eyes glued to the screen, my ears covered with a headphone. So besides speaking with said friends in the pc, I don't have anyone.Well shit, no surprise I'm like this, ey?mood: Keep your name by dirty projectorsThing is, I don't even want to get better. I'm enjoying the pain. It kinda makes me feel less pain in general.There are so many people in places way worse than mine. Believe me, I'm a blessed person. And I'm feeling ashamed to be in such situation, but hey, that's what's happening. I wish I could just drift away, like stop eating and slowly fade away, no pain, just feeling my energy decreasing and disappear."
I don't see any reason to keep going.,"I seriously can't. I hate how health and financial success is wasted on me. I wish I could trade lives with some poor kid in a third world country. Someone who never had a chance. They can have my life, my money, everything. I just don't want to live anymore. I'm so tired so everything being so fucking hard for me. I wish someone who could appreciate my life could have it. The universe is so fucking stupid why did I even have to be born? I never asked anyone to exist. So why was I born just to suffer this miserable existence? I don't even feel like writing how I feel anymore. I just give up. I'm done."
Every day is a struggle to not go through with it,"I dont know where else to turn. I dont know where to start. I just know I want nothing more than to be in a horrific accident that kills me almost instantaneously. I don't know why I feel like this. I don't know how to fix it. I just don't know. Hell, I don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I'm completely losing myself in an empty void, and no matter how much I reach for help from my SO, I still feel alone. Why can't I just die already? It's not as if anyone in my life notices, appreciates, or even truly cares about me. I'm no one. I'm the live-in maid to my family. I'm worthless. I am completely unnecessary. They don't need me whatsoever. So why do I continue with this life?  I've even dubbed my own theme song to be ""Mr. Cellophane"" from . I find myself singing the chorus a lot lately. ""Cellophane, Mr. Cellophane shoulda been my name. Mr. Cellophane, cuz you look right through me, walk right by me, and never know I'm there."""
My good friend [M/30] has had several breakdowns. He is now distancing himself from FH and myself. He's close and we don't know what to do.,"FH and I fear one of our good friends is very close to going through with it.He's confided in us a long time ago that he's suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time. We've had several scares and dealt with/witnessed a handful of breakdowns. He fell off the radar a little over a year ago for a solid day and a half after an emotional break and we went as far as breaking into his house to check on him. Didn't find him but his car was there. Turns out he self harmed and called an ambulance on himself.
The most recent break being 2 weeks ago. Since that last break, he has basically stopped talked to FH (they work together so that's kind of a big deal). I think he went IN to their office twice and ""worked from home"" all the other times since. He's also taken off completely quite a bit. On top of that, when he does talk to FH, he's been a real jerk (based on what FH has told me of their conversations). I've suffered from depression myself, considered suicide and used to self harm so I am familiar with a lot of this. His most recent actions of being a dick to FH basically spelled it out for me: He's ready. He's pushing him away in order to push us out of his life and therefore ""make it easier"". FH and I are not giving up and want to help but don't know how.There was a turnaround yesterday because he came over and was at our place for a couple hours. Now, we have a shop in our garage that he and FH work in so him coming over unannounced and going straight into the shop is not uncommon. When I came home though, he was inside and watching TV with FH. He hung out for another hour or so but didn't say much. I know that him doing this is a positive but I want to know what else to do.He had lunch with a mentor figure yesterday to discuss everything (several of us know what he's going through and are basically ""on watch"") and when asked how far into this he's thought, he didn't skip a beat in saying he knows HOW he would do it. It doesn't help that he lives alone. We try to get him to come over or come out with us as much as possible but him pushing us away has put a hard stop to that.Please, we need help. I don't know what else to do. The night of his last breakdown, he and I sat and talked privately. He confides and trusts me more so than FH because I've told him my past dealings with this. FH is, admittedly, not an ideal person to help someone in this state of mind and everyone involved is aware of that, not that that's a bad thing - he's just not that kind of person. When we talked I was able to help him calm down but he doesn't really tell me the why's or the how's. He's been looking for a committed relationship for a long time now and nothing ever works out and I know that  is one of the reasons but he doesn't admit it. That's not something I can help either.How do we help someone dealing with so much? He's a very intelligent, good looking individual and is praised at work. He has a good core group of friends that are there for him for anything and everything. His family is intact and supportive. But even with all of this, he's depressed, thinks very low of himself, and dwells on his relationship status a lot. He doesn't even drink a lot. If he does, it's twice a week. They have a game-night that 4-6 guys join in and they'll drink at home during that. Then on Friday's they have their regular spot they go to with a regular group of guys, all great guys. Other than that, he's not drinking heavily. He doesn't smoke. He has a dog at home which I know helps but I'm growing more and more afraid that none of this is going to be enough and that he's closer than I'd like to believe.I'm sorry if I'm rambling. Please help us help him. He won't go see a professional. We're all he has."
Before I Go,"I have a note titled ""Before I Go"" on my phone. In the note is a list of all the things I want to do to prepare for my suicide. It's nothing complicated or fanciful. Not a ""Bucket list"". Just things to settle my mind. It's not even a long list. Mostly just cleaning the house. I want to feel relaxed when I do it. Is it strange? To want to clean my apartment before I die? I guess I just wanted to share. I've got no one to talk to. I figured at least here I wouldn't be alone. "
Life is a bitch,"Life is hitting me with waves of shit, but this week I was hit with a damn tsunami.
But let me not say that, because it seems to get worse.I'm so tired. Just tired of everything.When it's looked out of context, it doesn't seem too bad, but hear me out...it won't be that thrilling really, but it's just tiringIt was raining today as I was driving (in my mom's car {important for later}) home, I stopped at the traffic light and this guy behind me in his truck slammed into me. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but I exchanged some details and tried tone up as much as I could because he seemed shady.I insist that we go to the police station to get a case number etc etc. He agrees , and we go. Once we arrive at the police station he begs me to not involve the police because his boss is going to come down on him heavy, and his job is under scrutiny...Now I'm standing there, thinking, the world gives me such shit, and here I have the opportunity to just make this guy's life a little better, maybe safer too because heck, we need our jobs to survive. Yet on the other hand, it's my mother's car, and she would do things the civil way. I choose to take his details and not involve the police because why not, I am trying to be the better/nicer person, coz what you put in is what you get out right?? Not really I guess..I get home , I get a scolding, and I'm an adult, yeah totally normal, coz these things don't happen when people drive behind you in the rain . Gah. Hopefully the insurance sorts this out, but it's going to be a real pain.Fastforward 3 hours of crashing coz it was the only thing I could do while stressed.I can't find my flash drive with all my important documents on. It's these small things that pile up and just beautifully spreads the shit flavored icing on a garbage cake.Night time I'm forced to visit some family with the ugly dent in the car that my parents worked quite hard for, but only to be greeted with a congregation of my family too busy admiring this brand new sports car in the driveway.Who's new car is this? Oh, it's my cousin with the rich parents. So much years younger than me, has had a more blessed life than me.
Then you have to fake smile your way into congratulating him all night and fake admiring what a beautiful car it is. You just don't smile, and you become transparent and they start speaking how jealous you are without saying a word. Amazing how humans are with their interactions. I'm really just tired, but I beat through the night and fake smiled anyways.I should give more context on this said cousin but I'm too tired, so long story short, he is an asshole and we'll leave it at thatNow to think that I am out here reaching, doing what I must, trying to be nice, and life hands you this? Hell, it doesn't even hand it to you? It constantly smacks you with it. Why bother? It's really just all too much. I understand it isn't fair, but rising through this is really tiring. Just tiring.~kinda my second post, I don't know what I'm doing on here or Reddit . So go soft. It feels nice to speak all this out I guessI'm not sure if this even the correct subreddit to post this, but I'll leave it hear anyways"
Have any of y'all ever checked yourself into a psychiatric hospital?,"I am strongly considering checking myself into my local psychiatric hospital.However, I am transgender and bisexual so I have fears of being too vulnerable. Like the people working there might trigger me and make it worse.What was it like? "
I often think i would be better dead :/,Hey so I have SA a lot of it when I think I've hurt someones feelings or done something embarrassing I just want to die now a lot of people say ohh I wanna dieee but I actually do I hate dealing with some drama I had with someone I would rather just die and not deal with it ever again but there's often times where I'm so happy in alive night car rights or hanging with friends doing whatever but ive been thinking about wanting to be dead almost everyday I won't ever do it but its getting out of hand how much SA can effect me
"Waste of space and resources. Dont read, im too coward to do it","I've been thinking about killing myself my entire adult life. Why do I have to keep going if this feeling never changes. I have so much anxiety i could barely go tho jury duty,  I only get by at work because I avoid conversation and keep a wall up no matter what. I'm just a robot,  not enjoying anything anymore for years.  I hate that I'm even telling anyone bc I'm not worth it, ppl in my life tell me in not worth it and I know its true. I'm barely valuable in any context andd cause more trouble and inconvenience and wear ppl out so they don't contact me anymore and I end up more jaded an d guarded and isolated. I'm giving up at some point just not sure when"
For those with experience.,"I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels like not being able to reach the age of 30, and especially not 40, having these suicidal thoughts come up all the time. I'm 24 now, and have thought this way since I was 21.For those that thought the same way, and are older now, possibly 30+, how do you think now? Do you still feel you won't reach 40? or do you feel like you won't reach 50 now?Thanks for any reply."
"It's been a couple years, but I'm right back where I started.","It's worse than before. She can be seen everywhere in my room. Ever since that night she shows up, pounding me with screams and fists. I was never ready for a relationship again.Tomorrow is 6 months with a new girl. And my dads birthday. I'm only alive from the guilt of dying. It's slowly adding up, she's coming for me and I won't be free until I'm gone. I can't handle this relationship, I can't handle school work, I can't handle myself. Each blink, I feel it.
A fist on my chest.
Each day, it worsens.
She's coming.
I'll be free.
Soon. "
All I can seem to do is make it to tomorrow,Every day is a struggle just to make it to the next day. My resolve has been slowly chipped away. I don't quite know how long I can keep this up.
I've never been suicidal until now.,"& I don't really have a solid reason why.  The past few weeks have gotten progressively worse.  It started as simple stress & 3 months later, I just don't want to do it anymore.  No one in my family knows. The only person I tell is my boyfriend and it overwhelms him to the point where he doesn't even reply because he doesn't know what to do.  I called him crying mid panic attack because I didn't know what else to do & he got mad at me saying that I timed it perfectly since he's currently in Las Vegas at a music festival and I was only doing it because he's there.  I wish that were true. I would so much rather be that ""crazy"" girlfriend than to live with the thoughts in my head. He says he cares but will go hours with out checking his phone. He doesn't think its real.the past few weeks, I could feel this darkness inside of me grow and grow. I have cried every night wishing I could just make everything stop.
I've never been suicidal and these thoughts don't make sense to me. I keep trying to convince myself that it's for attention like everyone will think, but I don't think it is. I think about dying every night & how its an escape from tomorrow & every day after that.  I try and think about my family but there seems to be a mental wall where my brain isn't let me see over it.  I can't think about them. I won't allow myself to feel that.  It feels selfish & I feel guilty.
I've lived 22 years with anxiety and depression.  I have journals from 6th grade talking about suicide and how it felt like it was an inevitable thing. I used to self harm when I was 8 to get away from the emotional angst even though I didn't know what I was doing at the time.  This has always been apart of me.
I sought help January of this year and it helped in the beginning but now I feel like this is too much.  I just want to be hospitalized or something out of my own control so I can regain control but I don't have that kind of money and not a single part of me can tell my parents.  I want to tell them so badly so I can get it off my shoulders but I've seen how they react to that sort of thing first hand. They made my sisters feel guilty each time they chose to be hospitalized. Said it was for attention.
I wish it were for attention."
Today was the weirdest,Today I felt like I wasn't me. it feels like I was drunk or something. I am so depressed that it hurts physically. Please help. I have been crying for so long I might get blind
Someone to talk to? :/,Can you leave any contact info? If you want to talk about something serious it should be in real time.
Feel trapped between sanity and madness,"My mental health is broken and I feel beyond repair,  there are so many problems going on at once in my head it's hard to tell what is doing what sometimes, my mood changes so rapidly I don't trust myself anymore. I feel useless and less worth then others, I have tried to bring myself some self worth but i can't get it in a positive light  it's so deeply rutted in my mind it's a foundation of my reality, that I am less that I am not deserving of anything but pain. Anxiety,depression,feeling compelled to hurt myself,gender-dysphoria and uncontrollably mood swings, idk what to do anymore, I feel cursed, useless. Idk how I have been able to stay alive, how am I anymore ? Idk anymore "
I don't really want to die but I feel like it's my only option.,"I'm a 21[F] living with my alcoholic father who has leeched off of my brother and I since we were 11. He owes each of us thousands of dollars. Recently we stopped ""giving"" him money. My brother moved out a few months ago, he's doing really well and attending Berkeley. Now my dad is going to be forced to sell the house. And he says once he does, he's going to move into a trailer which is in a seniors only community...Yeah, the thousands of dollars he owes me would really help right now. I have some money saved up from work but if I'm to move out, which I will have to soon, I'm going to have to work more hours than I do just to be able to afford a room...It's always been really hard for me to work even two days/week while I'm in school. Now I might have to take less classes and I still have so many classes I need to take before I can transfer out of this CC. I really want to make school my focus but I don't think I'll be able to. I don't want to be in community college 4 years from now because of having to take light semesters. I hate being stuck in a town I have no one in. "
Why are guns so expensive???,"I don't know anyone who owns a gun, which means I have to buy one. But even starter guns are $400 at least. That's a big chunk of my paycheck, so if I fail that's a lot of money down the drain. Besides that, I don't know anything about guns. I can't very well go up to the shop owner and ask which gun is best for shooting myself in the head. What's my excuse for buying it? Would a vague ""home defense"" excuse work?"
Brother is suicidal.,"My half brother (late 20s) is a functional autistic; graduated with a degree in chemistry, can interact in society but you'd know he's ""off"" but the sad is, is that he knows something is wrong with him but not sure what and he knows that cause he has no friends and no one wants to be around him. It's a long story but I just found out he was suicidal because he's trying to join the Air Force (can't find a job) and he told me it's pending an evaluation from his school and when I asked what it was he reluctantly told me it's his therapy sessions for suicide. My step mom is a old school Korean mom who doesn't take it seriously and thinks anyone needs to make it through life is an education, she's deluded to the fact he has needs and the Air Force might be a death sentence for a guy who is isolated alone and depressed. He lives in Virginia and I live in California so I'm not around enough to hang with him. What's some stuff I can do to help him? Any advice would be appreciated."
It really feels hopeless to continue on at this point.,"Well, I guess I should preface this with mentioning the fact that I've desperately wanted to kill myself for the past 6 years or so. Barely anything has changed for the better, with far more things changing for the worse. As such, that want to end my life has persisted ever since then.It started for me when I started experiencing bullying at school, and my mother becoming abusive. At school, I was the target of being beaten up and constant taunts. And at home, my mother started to use increasingly violent punishments for smaller and smaller mistakes. To make matters worse, my mother would often downplay how much what she would do would hurt me, or deny that it even happened, and then punish me for, ""lying.""Since then, my mother has decreased in the violence of what she did and the frequency, but she still does it. For a good few years, my mother became increasingly not involved in my life, with my dad becoming the parent who took care of me more. Thankfully, unlike my mother, he wasn't the kind of parent who would hit his child. Eventually, my dad became very sick. He eventually moved away to live with his other family members because he was having a very difficult time in our household. For reference: my mother was frequently saying that he was faking how much pain he was in/him falling over. And she would frequently go on rants about how god willed for him to get cancer because he was a wicked man. She would have these rants when he was able to hear them.My dad was the only person really protecting me from her. Nowadays, it's been hell. I honestly can't take it anymore. I don't see any way out aside from just killing myself. I had tried contacting the authorities in the past but they only took away the thing I used to self harm and did nothing else except imply that they thought I was manipulative/lying to them. I genuinely was scared for my life because my mother was threatening to kill me, and they did nothing.I can't take it. I really can't. It feels so hopeless at this point. Nothing makes me happy. I have no friends. And my home life is a living hell.And well, to make things just that tiniest little bit more shit. I'm trans. And well, my mother is quite transphobic. She refers to trans people as, ""it,"" and thinks it's disgusting for them to use hormones. I'm not going to be able to leave this household for another few years, and even then, I doubt I'm going to be able to get away. My family is not in a good financial situation, so I doubt I'm going to have enough money to even possibly move out.It really seems like the best option I have is killing myself. Nothing is getting any better in my life, so it really seems like it's the only thing I have left. I don't want to have to keep going through this. Honestly, I should've killed myself already.Sorry that this was long winded, poorly formatted, and poorly organized. My apologizes."
low,i haven�۪t felt this hopeless in so long i need a sign i need something
Very suicidal but am stuck because of family,"Every hour of everyday I wish I was dead. I have multiple ways to end my life at my disposal, but I can't use them. My death would destroy my family, mainly my younger brother and sister. If it wasn't for them I would have been gone long ago. Its such a burden to carry I can hardly take it. My friends think I hate them because I've isolated myself. My grades are shit and it's my senior year of college. Im tired of therapy and different meds. It makes no difference. But I feel like I have to carry this burden... so that others can continue to live the normal lives that I'll never have."
The National Suicide Hotline Just Told Me To Call Back in Ten Minutes,"Seriously? I will never call them again.They were there for me exactly as much as everyone else in my life. Thanks, America! "
I'm ending it all before I turn 15,"My family makes me feel worthless. My mom confirms it with everything she says to me. My sister is constantly praised. Today my mom pushed me over the edge and basically told me I need to shut up, I make everything worse, I play games like my dad. I should've never told her how I thought, or told my parents I took too many pills last year. Im in an arts school but whats the use when you're damaged. I already have my plan. Carbon Monoxide in the car in the garage is the way to go tbh. I'm breaking down rn. Every time I feel life is getting better everything falls to shit. I don't want to have kids when i'm older, Im not thinking about college rn, I have no ambition. I'm someone that should off myself because natural selection is a thing, am I right?  Just getting everything out before I die. I'm done. Love you all. Goodbye?"
im back... yay,"wow. hey, i posted here a few weeks ago, and today was possibly the worst day of my life. i woke up to my parents fighting, then to the blood curtling scream of my little sister. my dad was gonna hurt my mom.... bad. we got him to leave, but now he is giving strangers copies of our keys, and he is threatening to hurt us all. today he hit me, hard. i am thinking of killing him, then killing myself. not gonna go into details, as the subreddit says, but yeah i cannot handle it anymore. life was feeling fine for a week, and then the non-existent god ripped it away. tonight i am praying he gets murded in some ally. i always knew he was a bad person, doing drugs, stealing from us and others, and always saying disgusting things about my mother in front of us all. i... i cannot accept someone like him deserves to live, and i dont want to ever let him hurt my mom, or my family again. tonight i sit by the front door with a knife, mainly because i am afraid of strangers on drugs coming into our house, but also to get revenge on my father, who never cared for anyone but himself.

"I want to die, but I have horrible anxiety, and my biggest anxiety problem is a fear of death. ironic right?","What is the best painless method? I'm thinking of jumping off the Gap in Sydney. As long as i land headfirst it would be instant yeah?I've already recorded all my goodbyes, and i'm completely ready, I just am so afraid of what comes next. My health anxiety means I worry about everything killing me. Even a prick on the leg sends me into a panic attack lmao"
"I Can't Do Anything Right, Quitting is the Only Option","I'm 20 years old, and it seems like my life is just a constant cycle of trial and failure. When I was young I was verbally and physically abused by the family and kids at school. My mom died when I was 13 and my dad became a gambling addict. The longest I've ever held a job was 8 months, most other jobs I quit within a month (or less), most of the time by not showing up and not calling. I had gotten fired from my favorite job for saying I wanted to kill myself to my manager. That was 6 months ago. Now, I'm a freshman at a local community college and it's not going the way I wanted it to. I've never been good with time management. I did well in school up until 6th grade. Then I started failing classes, my attendance was horrible, and I got in trouble a lot which eventually led to me dropping out. Now it just feels like the same thing, except now my mistakes are costing me money that I don't have. I have a 3 page paper to write by tomorrow morning and I only have a quarter of a page written, and I have to be at work in an hour. I also have to do two pages of algebra homework and write a paragraph about a chapter in my education book.I've never been in a relationship. The closest I've ever been to one was a really close friendship I had with my boss at my last job. A lot of the things she did and said confused the hell out of me and we ended up falling out and I'm still devastated by it. I can say with almost 100% certainty that I will never be happy. No matter how hard I try, life finds a way to push me to the ground and kick me when I'm down.It really seems like the only way out is suicide. I'm terrified of death but I can't go on living like this. I wish I could just move and start over but life isn't a movie. The only thing I really care about is music but I'm never going to go anywhere with that. I really just want to die. I honestly may just try to overdose on some pills before work. I can't deal with it anymore."
I've decided I'm going to commit suicide. As a 12/13 year old. Yerp.,"Hi guys! It's me, the smart ass! At least, that's what my Dad/youth pastor calls me. I've made multiple posts here as , but that account got banned so... after much thinking, I've decided I'm going to kill myself. The reasons why should be in the link to my main account, but the main reasons are my school and my parents (steriotypical for a 12 yr old, I know). I literally have nothing to hold me up, any support structure I did have my Dad is taking away. So I guess this is the end of the road y'all. My name was Lathan Armogida. I used to love acting, sports, and my friends. When I was 5, I said I would kill myself the day before I turned 13. I didn't really mean it, I just didn't want to become a yucky teenager. But yet here I am, prepping for my 13th birthday on October 1st, wanting to die. It makes too much sense."
I just want it all to fucking stop,I can't fucking handle this anymore I'm worthless and I deserve every day of pain that I experience
Might be my lucky day!,"Today's my 22nd birthday. Never really put value onto special dates or occasions but it sucks to feel this forgotten. Got drunk as always to numb myself a bit.

Idk if it is the correct sub, but who cares? My guts will be spread all over the sidewalk as well as my dignity in less than an hour anw. Read really interesting stories at this sub, hoping y'all either find the happiness you think you deserve or get drunk enough to find the courage to end it all. I will be ready to go after deciding to call parents or nah."
"Overdosed three months ago, want to do it again now.","I overdosed a month ago on painkillers and ended up vomiting up half my stomach. It hurt bad. I vowed that I never would overdose again, but I just feel terrible right now. I have no motivation to do anything, no nothing right now. I feel really empty. I have nothing to do, and nothing I want to do. I always thought I'd never be depressed, I'd try to stay happy.Ha ha, what a joke. My family doesn't even care, no one cares. "
Ruined my life and his.... Wishing to end it all.,"I guess I'll preface this with the fact that I am a 22 year old female. I recently got alternatively certified to teach in TX. Without doing research on the school I accepted a job as a 4th grade teacher in a shit town in South Texas called Victoria. The situation I was placed into was dismal at best. Everyone on the 4th grade team was new, 2 of us first year teachers, the other new to the district. We were given very little guidance or instruction. The job wore at me, I couldn't sleep at night I woke up every hour with horrible anxiety. 4 months previously I had met the man of my dreams, he didn't have it all together but we fell in love fast and hard. He had decided to take a job where he'd be on the road traveling installing turf. His job kept falling through little by little and he wanted to be with me in Victoria. One Friday the overwhelming stress of the job got the best of me and I made the mistake of telling another teacher at the school that of I had a gun I would have already killed myself..
Counselors and interventionist a stepped in and escorted me to a crisis center via cop car. Shortly there after my boyfriend decided to quit his turfing gig to come be with me thinking he'd easily find work... Which wasn't the case. He ended up doing day labor for 10-12 an hour... But depressed i still was. I scored a job as a restaurant manager, but through my Depression I couldn't think clearly and the job seemed overwhelming and too much as well. I ended up realizing I needed professional help. And my parents are in a position to help so I called them and I left and went back to the DFW. Leaving my boyfriend in victoria tx, almost broke. With no job and no one to help him like I have... He took a weed charge for me near San Marcos and then got another ticket for driving with an invalid license. So he has all this court stuff to go to in South TX and anyone he knows is in North TX. I haven't felt myself in a long time. I feel incredible guilt and shame and resentment towards myself for my inability to keep it together. I have suicidal thoughts daily. I've lost 10 ppunds from not eating properly. Worst of all is just knowing that I have essentially ruined not only my own life but his life too. When all he ever tried to do was help me and he believed me when I said that I'd be able to make it and that he should come down and be with me. Boy was I wrong. The regret I feel for the struggle he will face is haunting. He will most likely lose everything he has worked for. His truck will be repossessed and none of this would have happened if it weren't for me. "
I'm so alone,"My friends constantly lie to me, they don't want me around. They just feel obligated to care because they're nice people, and that's even getting to the point where they're constantly mad at me because I can't get better. I've never had a friend who actually liked to be around me. I can't be a burden on everyone anymore. I don't want to feel this way. I want it all gone. I don't want sympathy, I just want it over with already I can't live like this. I'm scared to kill myself but I want to so bad. "
Wanting to die,"I am not sure if this makes sense but I want to die because I am constantly frustrated and nothing happens to fix the problems or issues at hand. I am always working for hours and end and I try so hard to just do and be I is required of me; but if I ever ask something or want something it's unfulfilled and I am left high and dry time and time again.I am tired of always trying to persist or keep going on - I just don't want to live anymore.I am angry at myself, life, and everyone around me."
My birthday is going to be lame,"As usual family is coming out to see me either day before or weekend after but it seems more out of a sense of obligation than love. Idk I'm sad and not looking forward to it and on top of that I don't feel loved by anyone. My only wish, my only desire is to have a loving woman there on my birthday whom I can cuddle with and just feel loved for once in my wretched life. Life, if you can even call it that, has beaten me down so badly that I just sit at home and don't want to socialize with anyone. I'm diabetic ASD and crippling anxiety. For the anxiety for example. There is a woman who broke up with her boyfriend recently but I'm too afraid to ask her out. I don't know why I am typing this out. I'm tired and ready to just give up on everything. What's left except death. I can't stand being alone for so long.  It's eating away at my sanity"
"I've been suicidal for 7 days and it still hasn't ""passed""","Usually when I get this way I can recede away for a few days and slowly build myself back up, but not this time. I'm still 100% ready to do it. Maybe it's finally time"
"I'm writing my notes to my friends and family. This one is for you, the strangers who were so kind to me Thank you!",This is goodbye internet! I will miss you! I'm heading into the great dark soon enough. I'll try to tell you what's on that mysterious other side. I'll miss you strangers. You were always here for me and you were my best friends I'm sorry for doing this to you as well. Please forgive me and stay strong. Find your happiness for me. I did not mean for this to happen
Tomorrow or Tuesday,You know. I've posted for awhile.  I think I'm ready. I'm just looking for a good place to do it! I'd love to do it in downtown Los Angeles. Or suicide bridge in Pasadena. But any place where I can reflect. Then take my plunge.  That would be awesome. Please post places that would be great and the reasons why. I don't want to be talked out of it. I just want to hear places. It's going to happen... so just shit up and let it happen. Thanks!
Nothing left to do. I'm done.,"Let me preface this by sharing that I've struggled with depression, or some form of, since I was a child. At eight I started thinking about suicide, not seriously as I was young but old enough to know that it could potentially be a viable option. I won't get into the years leading up to this precise moment because that's a very long story, but I will say they weren't good. I'd reckon it's a 50/50 of life being an asshole and me being an asshole. Either way, I can count on two hands the happy memories I have of my 25 years being alive. I didn't start taking my mental health seriously until a few years ago. Prior to that I smoked, over ate, over drank, and basically sat on my ass all day with my now ex who wasn't great for me (nor I him). I couldn't even handle a part time job as the stress was too much. I bounced around university programs until I settled on an easy, useless degree to appease my family. I'm just trying to paint a picture here. So the current picture is this: I'm a mental health professionals wet dream. I decided I couldn't use my experiences in life as an excuse to be a lazy slob and decided to do something about it. From then on I've quit smoking, drink minimally, eat healthy enough, exercise a few times a week, have built friendships, started new hobbies, went into a healthy(er) relationship, see a counsellor, am on medication that seems to work quite well (for the most part, obviously), and I practice loving and appreciating myself. I have a great relationship with my parent who is letting me 'house sit' so I can pay off my student loans without worrying about rent. I have a full time job that is basically data entry and make less than I should for someone with a degree but enough for someone living rent free. Overall, I have a really great life that isn't very stressful and has given me many opportunities I should be appreciative of. So why the fuck do I want to kill myself? Why can't I just be content with my boyfriend, my job, my life. Why do I want to cry all the time, why do I get upset, angry, and stressed so easily. Why do I hate my life? I feel guilt about everything, I even retroactively remember things that weren't bad and turn it into something to ruminate on. I am so sick of my constant state of guilt, remorse, sadness, and anxiety. I feel like I've done everything I can and I think maybe some people just aren't cut out for life. I live in constant pain and fear and sadness. I'm too tired, tired of this roller coaster. I know I'll be happy again, I know there are things to look forward to in life but I also know I'm going to hit the bottom at some point. I am so sick of clawing my way back up only to be pushed down. I just feel done. I don't want to get up anymore. "
Before I go,"Everyday. It's been everyday since I was 6 years old, I've had at least one suicidal thought or action. Some days, it's only a quick idea, and others take up my whole day. I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet, and nothing traumatic has happened in my life. I want to tell someone, but I can't. There's something in my head that I can't get out. I'm only a teenager, and I rely on my parents from everything. I just don't want them to know because I know that they wouldn't care and/or tell me that ""I need more Jesus."" I fear confrontation. Because of this, I can't tell anyone at my school. The few people I've talked to said I should see professional help, but I can't for the reasons I said earlier. I'm trying to push it deep down, but for the past year, it's gotten worse and worse every day. I try to have fun with my friends, but for a while now, I'm not having fun. I'm just playing video games and trying to sound a tiny bit normal: ""laughing"" at jokes, talking a little. However, I'm becoming tired of acting. The same with my family. I used to have fun with my siblings. Now, I'm just there. I think my sister forgot what my voice sounded like because I haven't talked to them in the longest time. I think my parents are seeing that something is wrong. They are helping a little. My dad is often at work, and my mom makes sure I eat and hugs me every so often. But, I no longer find comfort in those little things. Everything is dull now. Food tastes like nothing. I hear people instead of listen. I even think my color vision is being reduced. I no longer can find happiness, it's only just life. My friends joke around and say that I don't have emotions. Little did they know. I no longer have a reason to live. I used to care. I used to try to get good grades. I used to enjoy cooking. I used to do a lot of things. The key phrase is ""used to."" I no longer have motivation in life. I don't want to be a quantum physicist, my used-to-be dream job. I don't want to eat. I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to live anymore. So, I think when I wake up tomorrow, I'm going to barricade my door with my dresser and hang myself in my closet. I just wanted to tell someone where and why I'm going. I've only written a letter to my sister and texted my friend about it, and my brother found one of my other suicide notes. I don't think they quite know the full extent of it though. I think at least someone will care on the internet. I'm no longer afraid. "
The only thing holding me back is my family,"I don't think you guys understand this, but for a lot of people, suicide would have a huge impact on their family. My mom told me that she didn't know if she would be able to go on living if I killed myself. My dad said about the same thing, and that's really the only reason I haven't killed myself. I don't want my peace to intrude on someone else's happy life. Both of my parents hate their jobs and are single and kind of lonely (though they try not to be) so I really feel like I'm a quarter of all they have left in this world (the other quarters are my siblings) "
Lies that need to stop around here.,"It will get better!You have so many people that care about you!You can do this!Call the suicide hotline! They'll help you!You are important!Keep trying! You'll find a combination of meds/therapy that works!All of these are bullshit. And if you post this bullshit or send it to me, you better be goddamn ready to back it up.Anyway, I told myself September. I'm keeping that promise."
"I cannot afford health insurance, should I commit suicide ?","I cannot afford rent, healthy food, and an acceptable standard of living ( like having a weekend) because I have not been allowed a high income by those in charge. I have HIV and several other pre-existing conditions and absolutely hate my job with a passion. What reason is there to live ?"
I've been passively planning my exit the last few years. Just need to do a brain dump now and get it out there,"I'm a male in his 30s, successful, healthy, people tell me they think i'm doing really well. I think almost everyone would be surprised to hear I am thinking about suicide. The last few years I have been planning my exit. I don't know when exactly i will do it, but probably before I turn 40.My friends are all married and having children, I am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work. I go to the gym a lot, I read, I have hobbies, I travel, I even moved across the country. I can improve lots of things about my life. I am a proud person and I am not helpless. Still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what I am going through. If I even hint at being depressed I get the old ""chin up, tough guy"" or people just stop calling. I also have very bad relationships with my family. I have one sibling and we will probably never speak again. Not close with my parents. I had one serious girlfriend, but we broke up years ago and I have not tried a serious relationship since then. Lots of flings and short term dating, but nothing serious and I don't think I could ever be in a relationship again.I just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live. I rarely experience any joy. I just work.. either at my actual job, or on hobbies and side projects, I am constantly working. The thing is, I like working. It gives me a purpose. Otherwise I feel like life is pointless. I have to make something out of my life. What else is there to do when you are my age? Dating is like torture to me. Everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time. I feel objectified and I never feel a connection. Sex is meaningless sensory stimulation. I enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty. The only thing I can offer women is sex or the superficial ""stability"" that women in their 30s want, basically to have a house and a car, the trappings of a ""successful life"". But that isn't what I want. I want to live a real life. I want somebody who likes books and doesn't care about bullshit. I have almost completely given up on women at this point, I'm tired of getting burned, and I don't want to date anyone i don't have a connection with.My sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection. Otherwise, i think I am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason, for decades and decades, until I am too old to work and i become useless. I can keep plucking away at some of my 'goals' for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances, friendly neighbors etc., but am I so crazy to think this isn't good enough? What is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and it's just you in a room alone?I don't want that to happen to me so I have started planning my exit. I don't feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life. I don't want to be around for those decades alone. It will be torture. I am going to give myself another 5-6 years and make sure I have my ducks in a row so I can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happen.The worst part is I can't tell anyone about this because I will be insulted and have them tell me i'm being a selfish cunt or that I'm just being ""dark"" for even thinking about giving up my perfect life. Nobody understands, i am completely alone in this world, and it looks like I always will be.Thank you for letting me get that off my chest."
"My life changed in the exact way I wanted it to be, and I'm just as depressed as before","I have friends that care about me, I go out and do things, I drink, I party, I have sex, there's a girl that's into me, I'm at a great college, and I'm just as depressed as when I would sit alone in my room a friendless virgin wishing he had a life.I just want to feel happy. I want to feel ANYTHING. Partying doesn't make me happy anymore. I have no motivation to work on the things I (should be) passionate about.I'm still not happy. I still feel empty. I want to drop out of school, and when I'm in class I barely pay attention.What's the point of living if I just feel garbage all the time anyway. I enjoy nothing. I'm a fucking black hole."
I am honestly unsure of how long I can continue,"Hey guys first time posting here so if I am doing something wrong apologies in advance. I am fed up. I am 23 years old and I feel completely alone. Like I have friends all 2 of them and a family that I love but no matter what I feel alone. I am 23 years old and I have 0 relationship experiance. I havent even kissed a girl. Large part of this stems from me being overweight. I have been working out for a year now and am down 30ish pounds but got a looong way to go. I am currently overwhelmed with school as I am pursuing an MSA and studying for the CPA exam at the same time all for a career I have 0 passion for. I really like this girl at work, like when I talk to her its simple all my fucked up thoughts and issues go away but we rarely see each other at work and this past summer I tried hanging out with her outside of it even as friends but despite seemingly wanting to go, her boyfriend did not let her so I got ghosted. We talk but the more I talk to her the more I like her which sucks because I know when I quit next year we will never talk again. It sucks talking to this person that you know in a year they will not even remember you. Its all over the place I realize that and I am sorry but I just got to get this off my chest."
I am so afraid of women that I should take my own life,"When I seal myself in my room to protect my socially anxious self from the judgements of my peers, I hear the voices of my roommates' girlfriends and I'm paralyzed in fear and depression. I get so upset that I can't see a way to escape the feeling besides killing myself. I am a bad person and I don't think that anyone would want to relate with me. I am terribly introverted and I have failed to live the life I thought I would live after 3 years of suicidal depression and social anxiety.My roommates bought a knife set for the apartment. I'm thinking about running one across my neck while they sleep."
Things,"Reddit keeps deleting my posts because of misclicks
I had a lot of things that make me suicidal but my mental frame is so broken that if I got a wrong reply on a post where I say those things I would have probably hurt myself. The one thing i would have talked about no one replied or liked so whatever i yell into the void nowIt is so late and I can't sleep because I want to kill myself yet again. I wish I can go back in time and tell myself ""misery is better than loneliness so you better keep this friendship because you will not be able to have another friend again.""
I wish i can stay home and watch TV all day and never worry about people No replying with just ""same"""
Bummed after finding out sleeping pills are a bad idea,"I've just read a bunch of posts about sleeping pills/ pills in general being a really bad way to go. The chances of causing death are almost nothing and I could end up with liver failure. Kinda happy but also annoyed at the same time. I'm too pussy to try a more lethal method, guess that means that I want to live."
"Years long depression, abusing substances atm. Anyone able to chat?","Hi whoever is reading this,After a very traumatizing event earlier today, I've found myself depressed, alone and frankly, unwilling to live anymore. I'm 21 years old and have been an emotional and very flawed rollercoaster of hurting and getting hurt for the past 7 years. After the final straw today, I decided to test myself. I'm heavily drugged up to the point that I'm pretty certain I'll either won't wake up or wake up to an event that will cause me to end it right then and there. The goal of the test was to prove to myself whether I'd be able to go through with 'it' or would some how find something to keep me going on this road to recovery with far too many set-backs.I've contacted the national hotline but they have told me they can only advise me so much because of the time. They have more people available at 8 A.M. which is in a little more than 3 hours.Fact is, I'm very unsure whether I'll survive this long with just my music and fading conciousness. Anyone willing to listen to the story for a bit? It doesn't matter if you care or not. "
"suicide note, im sorry.","Happiness, it doesnt seem possible.
trust me, i know people have it so much worse than i do, but im also not as strong as other people. i think about killing myself everyday, and its gonna happen soon.
i cut myself today, over 30 times as well, i hope that the burning feeling will take away how numb i feel, i sob so hard that i cant hear myself anymore,
i genuinly feel /numb/, i cant feel sadness anymore, i cant feel anything.
i want to just scream, scream until my voice leaves me completely, scream until everyone who's hurt me knows how badly they've hurt me.consider this my suicide note.side note; sorry for anything that isnt spelled correctly, im typing quite fast.kylie: thank you for being so easy on me when you let me go, i still love you, i think about you everyday, please find someone who treats you better than i ever could,

made the decision to do this. you ruined me. fuck you, i hope you get everything you deserve. just yesterday i went to where you work, i heard your voice an saw your
beautiful smile, i broke down, i know you saw it, all you did was smile more. fuck you fuck you fuck you.carlos: what you did was my breaking point, you didnt really know though, you just left me to watch anime with your friend and thats what upset me, im sorry if im over

alive and im not listining, im so sorry danny, im so sorry, im trying but its not working. i love you to the moon and back.this is farewell, im sorry, goodbye. "
I can't stand life,I am so alone in this world. Everyone ignores me and I feel like I am invisible.I have no friends. I'm super stressed out and bored from life giving me the same things everyday. I feel trapped and nothing and no one is willing to help me out of this box. The only logical way of getting out is to commit suicide. I think ending would be more fun than seeing another day on this miserable world. I need help.
fought with parents who were never supportive as they believed they were and now I'm going to kill myself,"hey,i wanted to kill myself for about 7 years now, im 17 btw. its was mostly family stuff, i didnt have a horrible childhood, its just that i got shit for everything i did good or bad. get b's? is this all you can do? get a's? its about time.....you know i got a 1440 on the august sat and i get shit for how i'm not going to a single college because my specs are garbage and im not greatful for anything they do blah blah they took everything from me so yea i'll probably slit my wrists or try to stab myself in the heart, just end my suffering please, i can now see why people get depressed and suicidal because of their families, now i see"
I have nothing,Why shouldn't i end it
I won't escape the horror until I die,"
If there's anyone out there in this worthless fucking universe could you please help me? If not I'll take it as confirmation of the hopelessness of my situation. I'm a 19 year old guy."
fuck it,nothing will change when I die
Where do I go to talk to someone?,"I feel like I need to talk to someone, but I don't want to worry about saying the wrong thing and getting forced into a mental hospital, getting the police involved, or anything like that. I want to keep it confidential. Where do I go?"
So I'm pretty sure I should start taking meds,"I can't stop thinking about killing myself lately. I think about it every day. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. Actually that's a lie, I think the last time I felt real happiness was walking through Yosemite. It's a beautiful place.Anyways, I want to die but I can't pinpoint why. I can think of many things in my life that kind of suck but they're not the justification. I just... want to die?I'm not sure how at risk I am of doing anything. Little things set me off. A passive-aggressive comment from a coworker will make me daydream about doing it. I don't feel sad about it, I'm at peace with these thoughts. I know that if it happens I'll do it by jumping. Seven stories and landing horizontally, headfirst, or in a cannonball position. It sounds so freeing. As I walk to work I note the buildings that meet the height requirement.Will these thoughts manifest into actions? Am I suicidal or do I just think I am? I should speak with a professional."
The tragic story of my life,"I�۪m aboriginal. Grew up in a good home. My senior year of high school I got bullied immensely. My ex cheated on me. She got with the guy she cheated on me with. I eventually got over all of that. Figured shit happens in life so whatever. Learn while you�۪re young right? Well it seems like I�۪ll die young now. I started drinking a lot and then it became a suppressant for my problems. Here I am few years later, feeling fucking sick because I drank a lot last night. Yet I�۪m still gonna take the test? Maybe I have some sort of will to push on? Although I will be drinking again tonight. Either in celebration of feeling like I did well on the test or depressed because it didn�۪t go well.I�۪m afraid that if it don�۪t go well I�۪ll leave this world tonight. Was I ever cut out for life? These are questions we ask ourselves in times of need. I�۪ve become a mess. "
I'm sick of everything and I'm ending it tonight,"I'm sick of being a worthless disappointment to everyone I know. I'm sick of causing problems for everybody through my own stupidity, carelessness and selfishness. I hate myself for it more than I've ever hated anybody else. I've been taking citalopram 20mg antidepressants but they don't do anything. I've got a pack of 13 tablets, and there are about 8 paracetamols in the cabinet downstairs. That should be enough for an overdose right? "
Being sick makes me suicidal again.,"Earlier this year I discovered smoking pot makes me not suicidal. I tried therapy and medication for years but all it ever did was make me even more anxious and depressed. Pot is so much cheaper and helps get me through the day. I don't even smoke daily, I'd say maybe 5 times in a 2 week period. It helps keep me happier, lets me function at work better, and it's pretty awesome cleaning the house and cooking healthy food while stoned.Except I've had a bad cold/sinus issue for a month now. I don't have health insurance or money for a doctor. Even if I did, doctors give me such bad anxiety I become suicidal just thinking about having to go to one. (Same reason I avoid therapists, my phobia is pretty bad.) I haven't been able to smoke while I've been sick, it really bothers my sinuses. That, plus the doctor anxiety, means I'm ready to go through all of my craft supplies to find something to hang myself with.I just want to not be sick anymore. I can't afford this. I already have issues due to all the abuse I went through as a kid, and how my finances are in the toilet. If I can't forget my problems for awhile, then I want out of this life. This world we live in is quickly going to collapse, anyway. With the economy, environment, and so on."
Just bought enough to end it,I'm so tired of doing this. I just bought the stuff to end it. I'm so done. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and I'm just done. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I keep reaching out silently hoping someone will notice and it will get better but I know at this point it won't. I'm planning to od on Tuesday. I know I have enough this time. I can't stop feeling like this and it's not worth living if I'm only going to be stuck in my head forever. Alone.
Fuck grade 10,"I have had a VERY SHITTY day. First theres a guy in my science class who was talking shit to me calling me a fag/quear i called him a druggy (im not totally against drugs as i smoke weed but he does hard shit) he got out of his seat and wanted to hit me but teacher caught him. So i laughed it off. I went to gym class and me and my Bestfriend started playing around poking each other in the ribs laughing he went all bipolar (he's not actually bipolar) and slammed me into the wall i was like ''dude chill i thought we are playing around'' i went to drawkick the soccer ball and guess who gets hit ""him"" he punched me in ny face now my lip is puffy sliced and bleeding. I then smoked him in the face 2 or 3 times and kicked him in the nuts he then layed off, i was told to go to the office i was so furious i punched a locker . We talk to the principal neither are in trouble. I went home so angry. i put 14 holes in my walls, smashed my dresser, took a knife stabbed my walls dresser chair everything screaming (keep in mind i NEVER get mad im a chill loveable guy) till my knife broke. I went full crazy slicing my arms. Im so mad 3 hours later im still angry and smashing stuff. I m depressed, he gave me a bloody lip and all i did was hit him, i always thought i could fight, all i hear is, looser im my head. i feel like the cash me outside chick. Im worried about tomorrow will everyone be nice to me, does the girl i love think im a looser, i dread tomorrow. Im most likely gonna fight the guy in my science class tomorrow. God i hope people will help me"
Anybody's parents died? Reaching the eve of the anniversary of my moms death and I'm having a really hard time.,Anybody have an advice or an encouragement I could really use some help
Please someone talk to me. Help.,"I have tried everything. Been in four psych wards, 15 different medications, therapist, weed, meditation.I can't do this anymore. I'm blowing up constantly on my SO, on my 6 month old and three year old. Because I am so fucking depressed and I want to die every. Single. Day.My so says he's worried about me but I know he doesn't know how to help. Idk how to help myself. Please someone tell me something worth living"
I can't take it anymore. I'm out.,"It's been over 8 months since my girlfriend left me after our time together where she constantly abused me mentally and physically, i still love her despite all of that. After she left she made some new friends and either they brainwashed her or she brainwashed them because now i'm the bad guy.All i want is for her to come back because she was the love of my life and i know she was ill and that's why she acted like she did, but that will never happen so i will keep suffering like i have been. So i'm just gonna end it all because it's not worth it. If i can't be with her, i rather die."
Im emotionally drained by helping a friend,"I had to rewrite this post as she probably lurks in this subreddit and would know who I am.Long story short, I've been helping someone for about 4 years on and off about her suicide (obviously convincing her not to do it). Frankly, I'm pretty emotionally drained and tired from all of this because she doesn't learn from  her mistakes. What can I do? "
i dont know what to do anymore.,"this is the second time i got in an argument with a friend in the past year. my friend said that im a nobody and im the weirdest person out of everyone in the group. all this happened in front of my friends too. so apparently im a weird loner who is a nobody. these are the only friends i have in california and i moved out here with them from ohio.  my self esteem was always low, can never talk to girls, never got respect from people unless they are using me. and now this. i dont know what to do anymore, i really want to end it."
Th - th - thats all folks.,"Well, this is it y'all. I dont ever see myself being happy. Farewell, Redditors. Just know, its been one hell of a ride."
Im not at a good place right now and I want out,"Forgive me for bad punctuation but anyways im a 24 year old lost and broken soul. Off the bat I will say im a 100% loser and a fuck up. How the hell did I let my life get to be this way? Ive achieved absolutely nothing except becoming a felon before the age of 20 and have all my ""rights"" taken away. I got 7 felonies from 1 crime at 19 years old (3x grand larceny, statutory burglary, conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretense, and possession of a burglary tool MY FOOT) I plead guilty to all of it. I did a little time for it. In there I realized this does not define me at all. I finished my short tenure and was released. I had no idea what I was in store for. I became homeless. Jump ahead 5 years I am still homeless. Since my release I still owe restitution and just can't afford to pay it payment plan or not and this unfortunately is preventing me from owning a drivers license and a car. Yes these are only materialistic things but in our society and especially you need wheels. Ive had 16 18 year olds coming up to me asking me what kind if car do I drive. I feel like total loser telling them well actually ive never had a car. I can't even date because most women like a guy with a car and money and confidence and a future. I went to college real brief and ending up flunking out. I jumped the gun on something I wasnt fully prepared for. Finding a job with no experience as a convicted felon FORGET ABOUT IT. Ive been nothing more then a total disappointment and a failure and thats all ill ever be. Im just a statistic and pretty soon im gonna become a statistic for something else SUICIDE IN FELONS. You can call me a coward or tell me it'll get better or say never give up but its already too late. Thanks for those of you who actually read this and Goodbye "
Came very close today.,"I just needed somewhere to get this all out today, I don't think it helps to keep everything bottled up so this seems like a safe place. Long story short, and to be blunt, I almost slit my wrists today. I don't even know what I'm capable of anymore, and it's terrifying. Everything is slowly going to shit. I can't afford a math access code for my college class right now so I'm failing homework assignments. I got a 49% on my math test yesterday. What kind of idiot gets THAT low of a grade on a college algebra test? I'm fucking pathetic. I don't even try anymore. I used to work hard and get straight a's but now I won't even put forth a little effort. This probably already screwed up my gpa and proved my stupidity enough to ensure that I can't get myself into medical school. I've been depressed for the past 3 years of HS and college is just making it 20 times worse. My family has no clue about my depression, they never have. I can't tell them, I really can't. My mom and brother both have bipolar and my mom is always telling me how glad she is that at least one of her children isn't struggling with such things and it would really bring her down. I've always been the one to have their shit together. I'm always the one smiling and making everyone laugh. But right now I can't even put that mask on. I just want everything to stop. It's so freaking overwhelming right now and I can't do it. I can't do any of it. I'd absolutely love to feel my life end and pick up a razor again but I can't because it will destroy my family. I don't know, I guess I'm just looking for someone to honestly tell me that it isn't the end of the world but right now I can't see how any of this will get better."
There's a reason I'm stuck in my room without help.,"Because if I try to get help, if I tell anyine how I'm sitting here with a razor ready to kill myself and that I need help, I'll just get stuck locked up in a room for 3 days while nobody does anything to help me, and then they'll charge me $2500 for the inconvenience.It's fucking pathetic. The hotline is useless, I've called it before. If you're not immediately in danger of killing yourself, they end the call. If you are, they're not interested in talking, just asking me where I'm located and trying to call the cops on me.There is no help."
I have never wanted to kill myself more than in the past few weeks.,"I'm not the person to usually have suicidal thoughts (although I am fucking depressed and a total wreck) but the past couple of weeks are making me have the worst urges.I'm in college and I've been a fucking failure. I've been studying longer than my peers. It is getting better but recently I started failing exam after exam and it is breaking my spirit because I study for hours every day yet get little result. And then when I say I failed they ask ""well whose fault is that?"". It's fucking mine. Do you need me to spell it out?On top of that, my parents fight. Like, almost daily. It isn't physical as much as it is mentally draining and abusive. Arguing, fights every day, then each complaining about other side to me and making me into a mental trashcan. My only fall back used to be my grandmother but even she recently started putting problems on me because of my insane mother.On top of that, I am eating pounds of candy to artificially keep my mood somewhat sane and give me happiness for a short period as I study but I worry about getting fat again because I used to be obese. I am also paranoid about getting diabetes because I am eating insane amount of sweets.On top of that, my parents won't leave me alone. I just had a huge nervous breakdown when my father kept pushing me for the results of my exam that I don't have. I tell him that I don't know, that it could go either way fail or pass. He pushes, keeps accusing me of lying, then I lie.. telling him how I failed. And then he keeps pushing and asking more even when I tell him to please leave me alone. If I would lock myself, he'd threaten to break down the door like he did before.On top of that, I have to get up early tomorrow to get ready for another exam after today's one but I can't because it doesn't matter that I got all nice and calm, brushed my teeth and masturbated. I had a massive nervous breakdown and now I struggle to go to sleep peacefully.On top of that, I have no one to turn to and talk to after all this. My mother is selfish and when I did choose to turn to her and talk she told me this whole thing is going to give her a heart attack (self centered and trying to emotionally manipulate me into worrying), tries to turn me even further against my father and showed desire to get away from me/stop talking by forcibly ending the conversation when she was comfortable; not me.On top of that, I can't go to kitchen to get sweets to calm my nerves because my father is there and I know he is a piece of shit that can't shut up and resolve some things later, which will turn me into an even shittier mood.I really want to kill myself right now. I really do. I wouldn't even have second thoughts about my parents like some of you because they're pieces of shit and I don't care about ruining their lives. But I won't. I want to live and have the life I dream of and I know that it is possible. I just wanted to pour my heart out to anyone who wants to read/listen because I want to not feel like a mental trashcan for a day. Thanks."
Today Wasn't different,Last night I wrote a post about how I wanted today to be different--how I wanted to actually do things and not be miserable. It was the same sort of day I've had for the last ten years. I hate my life and can't get out.
"I wish I had a gun, I would love to blow my brains out right now, I don't want to commit suicide and then not have it be successful. I hate this life. I really really want to die.",What's going on?
My ED is too much for me to handle.,"I just can't carry on anymore.I thought I was doing okay, that I had my BPD, depression and anxiety under control, but my eating disorder is back and I just feel so gross. I want to kill myself over something so stupid as my looks. It's stupid, but is real. I want to finish everything over my fucking weight.I'm stupid and better off dead."
What I can't say anywhere else,"I feel like I'm just waiting to die. Like I'm just passing time in this pointless, unfair, cruel life, being constantly assaulted by my brain and its fucked up chemistry and the constant pain in my chest begging for death, always hurting even when I take my medicine and don't actively want to kill myself.I don't care about anything anymore. I don't care if I die without ""leaving my mark,"" I hate this world with a burning passion and just want to leave without tainting it further. I never asked to be here. My parents were so selfish to yank me into existence and force me to live the  lives they couldn't, not even caring about me.Every time I say anything about how I want to be dead people instantly shut me down. I'm not valid. They want the drugged, medicated version of me who doesn't talk about dying and who doesn't cry all the time. At my best, I'm a bitter, sarcastic cynic. It's so cruel to be forced to live, and that everyone except me is encouraged to be themselves while I have to pretend to be ok just so I don't make everyone around me even 1/1,000,000,000th of my daily level of discomfort and pain..."
Update from yesterday: 16-year-old with schizophrenia.,"Hey! First off, thank you all for taking the time to help me out yesterday! The advice you guys gave me was needed. You probably saved me from myself, too, as I would have more than likely killed myself during the night. I'm forever in your debts. Update: okay, I contacted the school administration and reported what my friend had done to me (exposed and mocked me openly in front of the school for being diagnosed with schizophrenia). Everyone from school who gave me death threats or bullied me online is suspended for the week (yay!). Also, this morning I saw my doctor and I'm on the appropriate medication that I should be taking.
I will start therapy today, and I'm hopeful that I can move forward from all of this.But again, thank you all for being amazing people. This community saved my life last night.Link to yesterday's post: "
Who else feels like they're only still living to spare the feelings of their family members?,"There's nothing in my life worth living for anymore. Everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone. I'm disabled, in poor health, I suffer abuse on a daily basis and I feel totally alone in this world. It would be a relief to be able to just stop existing. The only thing preventing me is the fact that I have 1 or 2 family members who I feel would be deeply affected if I were to check out on them. So I suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings. Anyone else in a similar situation?"
I can't believe this is my life,"I can't suffer forever, I will need to eventually do this. I will need to eventually kill myself, i still can't believe this is what my life has come to. You only get 2 hands, 2 feet, 2 eyes, 2 arms, 1 life. It's not fair, it's unforgiving. You get one life, if something ruins it - that's it. you're life is over. I never thought I'd be the girl who would ever have to kill herself. Now that I'm at this point, it's just surreal. I can't believe this is my life."
"If I Killed Myself on a Monday, My boyfriend Wouldn't Realize It Until Friday","I've been having intense suicidal thoughts and imagining how people at work and how my friends and parents would react upon finding out I killed myself. I spend a lot of time crying at work hoping no one will notice. I'm going insane, quietly chanting ""I wish I was dead"" at times. Whenever I'm driving or walking down the street, I'm secretly hoping someone will hit me, but only hit me hard enough to kill me - I don't want to be alive with a debilitating injury to make my life even worse. I'm even imagining what I would do before finally pulling the plug. I've been thinking about creating my perfect day - go home to see my parents and my best friends that I rarely get to see since I moved away for my shitty dream-crushing job, go out to my favorite restaurants, plan my last meals. But if my friends are too busy with their successful lives to hang out, I might just stay where I am, go to Red Lobster by myself and get fattened up, then kill myself before the calories can absorb into my body. Since I only see my boyfriend on the weekends and he rarely texts me at all, I can kill myself on a Monday (that way I at least didn't work the whole week for nothing) and he wouldn't even notice something wrong until Friday when I'm not rolling up to his house. Maybe he'd try to call me, but there wouldn't be an answer."
Goodbye.,"Only 30 mins until I'll be alone in my apartment and be free at last. Thanks for all of your ""help"" but it wasn't enough. Goodbye."
"Less empathy for ""scary"" mental illnesses","I've noticed that the majority of sympathy towards"" those with mental illness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression and/or anxiety, as opposed to those with chronic depression, chronic suicidal thoughts, treatment-resistant depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. While I'm by no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters, I am sick and tired of people with mild, easily-treatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go through.Take self-harm for example. If you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes. Feel sad because you can't get a job? Have a little empathy. Hear voices? See things that aren't there? Always angry? You're difficult. You're a burden. You're an emotional vampire, you're an energetic drain. You're a toxic person beyond helping. Feel a little bit anxious? Here, have a bit of empathy. Can't leave the house because you feel like you're dying? Can't keep a job because social interactions make. I'm so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured, almost fully-functioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldn't die. No one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday. No one likes it when you're clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you don't off yourself. I struggle from an eating disorder. I make cuts in my skin. I'm always suicidal, I'm glad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed, by mine AREN'T. My problems rule my life, and they're something I'll struggle with FOREVER, they color every part of my life. There are much less resources for people like me, and I'll never be apart of the ""conversation"" on mental illness, because everyone would feel better if people like me didn't exist to begin with.I'm a burden on everyone around me."
Why am I like this,"Something's wrong in me, I cried yesterday at work. I can barely make it an hour without tearing up, I feel so empty inside. I feel like I've lost everything. The people I called friends have now admitted that they hate me, my family is falling apart, the girl I loved played me. But you know what the worst part is?I fucking deserve it; I made my friends hate me, I caused my family to fall apart and I broke that girl's heart too many times. I don't know where this will lead me. Maybe it feels good to get it off my chest, maybe it won't matter. I just can't live like this anymore, if the worst happens just know I loved you all. This is on me."
What is mental health?,"I don't mean that literally, but it kind of plays into how I feel. I feel like my mental health has completely deteriorated. I think I suffered from clinical depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, loneliness, and avoidant personality since age 11, and  until after high school. I feel like this has left me horribly developmentally stunted. I feel like my entire life has been one large distraction from life itself, having spent nearly all of my free time playing videogames and watching television that did absolutely nothing to improve who I was in any way. I think I only ever swam in my youth (swam usa club teams for 7 years) was because the endorphin release it provided was merely another means to escape feelings of anger, boredom, loneliness, depression, and inferiority. I kept sacrificing so much of my time towards it because of the escape. The only reason I gave a shit about my times or stoke technique was because it helped me feel superior to other people. But don't mistake me here, I didn't flaunt my (in the grand scheme of things) unimpressive swimming abilities in people's faces; I just quietly basked in the glory that came from being better at something than most people, despite also not being very good in the world of people who took swimming seriously. I never had any solid interests in anything important growing up. I still don't really, but being an adult forces you to semi-care about the important things. Things that I not once ever seriously considered. Like who I am, what my role in society is, what I'm good at, where I need to improve, what the road to succeess looks like, what path I should take in my life, etc. I always coasted along on this strange, unjustifiable feeling that I was great and deserved great things, in an almost narcissistic way. I lived constantly in fantasy and daydreams of accomplishing whatever I wanted to at the time, but never actually did anything to get there because from an incredibly young age, probably starting in  elementary school, I always felt inferior, and I never resolved these issues because I never felt comfortable talking to anyone (like my parents) about these internal struggles. From the day I was born I never vocalized my feelings of inferiority, which I think is partly because of shame but also not thinking anything of if. Why? Idk. I blame it on myself for being a dumb kid who never learned how to communicate these things, and still don't to this day because it would be plain inappropriate to share these things with a fellow adult who isn't a shrink that I can't afford. I could talk to my parents but I have and let me assure they are far, far from able to provide me any solace. My mom is 52 and faces issues that fall in line with early dementia and has too many complicated emotional issues of her own to ever be able to help me. My father is 61, suffered a stroke deeply effecting his ability to properly socialize and also suffers from depression and low self-esteem. He actually went to the hospital for suicidal ideation this summer. Anyways I'm so tired, I can'y fucking finish this post and say all I wanna say, but fuck I want to jump off the Harry Nice bridge so fucking bad. The only word I can use to accurately describe myself is ""broken"", and as you can see that just barely scratches the surface.  I'd like to go into how becoming more aware of this brokenness in highschool lead to a weed habit that sabotaged pretty much every shot at success I had to this very day,  and how that just provided a nicer escape with the added bonus of but a semblance of a social life that I was (and still am) so desperate to have. The ultimate escape just seems too appealing at this point. "
goodbye message,"i wanted to say goodbye to all the people who were kind and good to me.i want to thank my parents who even after my continuous disappointments talked to me and cheered me.but I don't think I can take it anymore.
goodbye.i quit"
When those suicidal thoughts hit...,"Some information about me, I am 20 years old and i recently transferred to a new school. I am a junior, and I have social anxiety. This past month has been hard. I legit do not have friends. I haven' t made any, and I don't see any on the horizon. I come from a big family, and I had a very large group of friends at my old school. I legit go to class, and then go back to my apartment because I just feel uncomfortable being out alone. I live alone, and the only thing I can think about is how easy it would be to just stop. It feels like no one, except maybe my mom, would even notice. I just feel so lonely and depressed, and i just want to end it. "
Least painful method of death,"I'm pretty convinced that carbon monoxide is the best way to go, legally anyway. Can any people who've attempted it this way give me any insight?"
I think I should kill myself. I don't know what do I'm in a terribly ambiguous situation.,"Okay, so earlier in the year I posted a question on Reddit about how i was planning on killing myself because i masturbated while my roommate was sleeping. Everyone was really nice and told me not to do it, so I didn't and I deleted the question. However, when I deleted the question, it still kept my responses to comments from people who commented on my original post, and it kept the comments that i replied to. Weeks after I posted my suicidal question, I posted another question about how I was struggling with my friends. I had my phone screen facing up on a table when I was talking with my friends, and when I got a response from someone, it had the username of the commenter as a push notification on my phone. It appeared on my screen.I have OCD, and I was worried that my friend saw the username, looked up the user, and looked up the user's comments on my post. I'm also worried that my friend saw my suicidal post and my response to what the commenters said, and the commenters posts.Why I am worried is because the stuff the commenters said said things like ""don't worry about it man, I had sex with my girlfriend while my cousin was passed out on the next bed! You're normal"" and ""I've done what you done before. I still feel like a terrible person and a pervert, but you were pushed by you're desire to procreate."" I'm worried my friends know what I did or think I did something terrible and extremely perverted. What should I do? I'm thinking I could kill myself to stop living in all this pain and mystery. My friends have still occasionally talked to me this summer (only about twice), but I kinda don't want to be friends with them because they're hyper-masculine and not very inclusive."
I wake up in the morning really disappointed that I'm still here.,"Pretty sure it's never going to get better, I literally don't see how it would be. And even if it does, I'm still all alone so what's the damn point "
I physically can't cry anymore.,"I don't have the motivation to talk to anyone about anything anymore. I just feel dead and broken and i just want my life to be over. I just make everyone i love and care about hate me because they should. they just fucking should. I'm just judgmental and needy and clingy and self centered. I try to make other people happy but i just end up talking about my own problems instead of helping other people which is all i wanted to do in the first place. I'm a miserable, pathetic excuse for a human being and i deserve death in every single way.  "
Sucidal thoughts are on my mind so often.,"Hi everyone, first of all I would like to say thank you to everyone who is in this community to help others, that's something the world needs and I really appreciate.I don't know what to do with my life anymore, today I received another bad news (school-related, but it really doesn't matter) that made me think once again of suicide. Lately I've been thinking of it literally everyday, even for just a few minutes a day or sometimes a whole hour. I like the idea of letting everything go and being truely free, but I don't want to be this selfish.Dying is a common thought in my mind and I find this so sick. How can someone think about death so often and enjoy the thought? Needless to say I don't like my life, luckily I'm not disabled and I don't have particular mental problems (or at least not that I'm aware of), I have a girlfriend and a mother who loves me, these last two are the only reasons of why I'm not leaving this world.** I live day by day trying to be grateful of what I already have, but this is not the life I want to have, and it feels so bad to accept everything instead of having more. **I love my mother and my girlfriend, she's also aware of my problem but never been able to help, never seen a doctor either but I'm not willing to. I hate everyone else, I hate my family and the few friends I have. It's surely because of me, we have to work on ourselves before blaming on others and I did, but it's not my fault if the world is SO cruel. I'm tired of all the awful things that happen on a daily basis, not just directly to me.I'm agnostic and I believe there is a god, I always needed some sort of connection with it but the only thing I had, ever, was a dream of around two years ago. In that dream I ""saw"" god (who's not a specific entity, it's everyone and everywhere*) and a kind of love I've never felt before, I felt the peace of me and everyone in the universe. That dream for me was what there is after death, pure inconditional love with no past, present or future. During years I understood that love heals, I've been having suicidal thoughts since several years (not at all with this intensity though) and something that always helped me was meditation, my kind of meditation at least. Smoking also helped, now everything seems just pointless. I belong here if I am, and so do you. But what's the point of living a sad life in a world ruled by evil? The only thing I've ever asked for was complete peace of mind and I pretty much never had it, lord knows.I never visualize my future, when I do I just imagine what could happen but I just don't know, I'm not even sure if I will still be living. I've always been unsure about my future since I can remember, and that's something I find pretty weird because most of people has a pretty clear vision of what I want to do in life, but I do not. I don't expect to receive help or answers here, I just wanted to share my little story. Thanks to all of the people who spend time reading this subreddit and helping each other. *of course that's my opinion, but it was like I was dead in that dream, and everything was just fine. I've never felt anything like that before, nor after. "
"I am not depressed anymore, I just don't have what it take to be alive","I�m 29 years I live with my parents house with my son and her mother she is going to graduate in February is when I will commit suicide. I lived with depression for 10 years 5 of them going to psychiatrist and take meds but i stopped because they were not helping and was wasting money, now i am not depressed anymore is that nothing  make me happy can�t find joy or anything and i�m tire of faking around my family.The worst of all is that i don�t want to work i just want to do nothing  i just want the quit embrace of death because if i live i have to make money but i don�t want my parents keep paying to keep me alive.Edit:Not the day of her graduation after February i already wait 10 years what's a couple of months more"
Locked In Mental Hospital,Ive been sanctioned for 6 months and im forced to take meds every day which have horrible side effects. This place stinks of piss and they strap me to a bed. Im crying so much please help. Im not allowed out of the building apart from 2hours a week.
I can't do this anymore,"Life is so tiring. I hate feeling sad all of the time. I hate feeling like garbage. I'm trying so hard to fight off this feeling of looming dread that hovers over me 24/7, but my endurance is waning. I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life if I don't just end it now. "
"I don't think I'm gonna kill myself, but I wish I could die in a way that wouldn't make my few family and friends feel sad about me.","I don't feel worthy of killing myself. I've always had people surrounding me, a loving mother and brother, a few good friends and nothing traumatic has happened to me before. But for a while now I've felt the feeling that I would rather be non-existent or dead. I have multiple suicide notes addressed to many people in my life, but I feel that if I actually do it I'll still cause them a lot of traumatic harm. I just don't know what to do with myself. I feel like if I died of natural causes then it would be perfect. Like a car crash or something. I have a friend who is also at risk, and I feel that if I did it then I would be selfish towards her. I've only now started trying to get myself help, and it's my first post here after lurking for a while. I'm going to see a councilor soon and see if they can help."
Im sorry I couldn't help you.,"I work in a night club and tonight a gentleman came in who looked very frantic and on edge. I chatted with him for a while and it became apparent that he's a massive overthinker and very logical. He started talking about how he has tried to kill himself and how he's going to try again when he gets home.
I understand, Ive been there so many times but it really hurt to see someone so determined and ready to die. He shared with me how he's going to do it and I tried to talk him out of it. Everything I said didn't make a difference though, he appreciated the time I took into talking with him but he was ready to leave. He said he just wanted the noises to stop. I told him to remember the good things in life and try to take something positive away in our chat but he gave a small salute goodbye to me and left. I'm sorry I couldn't help you tonight. I hope you come in next week and tonight wasnt the first and last time I hear from you. You deserve so much better and I wish I could make the noises stop so you can sleep easy. I hope you're okay.Edit: If by some miracle that you read this, please know that there's a strange girl out there that does care about you and I sincerely hope I hear from you again."
"Burst of energy after ""suicide attempt""","So a week ago I had one of those  bad days. Ended up cutting myself for the first time and tried to strangle myself with a scarf. I know. Really stupid method. But that's not the point.After I ripped the scarf of my neck and the color returned to my face I had this sudden burst of energy and I actually felt better. Idk. It was so weird. Adrenaline kicked in? Or endorphins released from cutting?Btw, I'm back to feeling like shit a week after."
I'm a fucking mess,"I'm just fucking depressed. I don't understand why the fuck I can't wake up in the morning. Everything I do to help leads me back to the same place. I hate my job, I hate living at home, and I feel trapped. I don't know what to do.EDIT: Seeing all the unanswered posts under ""new"" is really depressing in itself."
Bye guys,See ya man. I hope you've found peace.
Shit,When I was 17 I attempted suicide by running a hose from the exhaust pipe of my friends dads van into the drivers side window. The van over heated and I walked home but I can't help thinking that maybe it didn't over heat and the reason my life has gotten aggressively worse since that day is because I died and I'm now in hell for committing suicide.
Ending this chapter tomorrow.,"I've had a pretty good life here. I haven't been abused, cheated, blackmailed or anything like that.
I just feel like leaving. This thought has sat in the back of my mind for years.All of my problems have been rooted from myself. I have shit social skills and I'm lazy. I confirmed this decision today.
The reason is I just don't see a future in me. I'll probably just struggle through school land some mediocre job and die. So why not just cut to the chase. When I'm dead all the shit that happened in the life before me will be forgotten and I will be nothing. A thousand years will go by and all of this right now won't matter. I'm not haunted by this being my last time I will sleep and experience the world because when I'm dead nothing will matter.I will update tomorrow and if something changes my mind I'll let you know."
Never thought I'd write here,"I subscribed to this subreddit not too long ago, just to read other people's stories. But never did I think that I would be the one telling the story. Here goes.So I'm currently an 18-year-old student. I'm usually very carefree and independent and stuff, but lately I've lost interest in stuff and have had pretty low moods. I have friends, a lot of money (rich grandparents) and my life is going good, nothing to complain about. Just for some reason I feel very down and demotivated now. Been that way for a while now, to be honest. But never have it gotten out of hand, until today. Me and my friends like to joke about pretty much everything, we have no filter (expect for when we are in public, we are not rude) (and I think that's good, we have a lot of fun.) Today I actually thought of suicide. And that made me think that I may need some help. I'm thinking that me behaving all careless and independent is not good for me, but the opposite. A few of my friends are currently in a relationship, and I guess I get a bit jealous of them. I might just be in need of a girlfriend and/or comfort. I would never probably harm myself or take it to the extreme, I'm the youngest of 4 siblings, and I know my siblings love me a lot. I couldn't bring my self to harming them by harming my self. ����I'm not really sure what I expect from you guys after reading this post, just some thoughts I guess. Maybe some one can find help from this in maybe realizing that they are in need of comfort as well, even though they act hard. Thanks for reading, feels good to put it out there. Sorry if the wording is bad or the post is just stupid."
I wonder if he would give a shit if I killed myself. I'm basically already dead to him.,I'm going through a horrible breakup. He's already seeing someone else. Doesn't talk to me. Never tried to reach out to me after the breakup. He doesn't want me. He told me he wanted to marry me but now he doesn't give a shit about me. If I died would he even care? Would he feel grief? I mean treats me like I'm dead so probably not.
I am going to kill myself in 4 hours.,I don't think there's anything anyone can say to change how I feel but I can't do it any sooner because I need the people I live with to leave.
Why is suicide gonna be so hard...,Got people to forget me. Then proceed to suicide.I thought it's going to be easy. But I'm literally unable to get a gun. Hope somebody can PM me some other ways.
Cannot Reach Monday,"I just got kicked out of my second university at the age of 25 because I had failed too many units last year because I kept losing to my depression. I haven't told my parents yet because I can't break their hearts anymore. I can't look in their eyes any longer knowing that I've failed them once again, and I won't be able to suffer through the emotional abuse brought about by their frustration which I completely understand. I don't want them to waste anymore time and money on me. I just can't do that to them anymore. I can't face them anymore knowing how much they're gonna hate me after finding out I've wasted another 2 years of my life and wasted so much money. I can't keep disappointing my siblings and friends any longer. Dying while they still have love for me is much preferable to them hating me while I live. I haven't told anyone, and I don't plan to. I just needed to get this off my chest.��For as long as I can remember I've always said I wanted to die at the age of 25. This can't be another thing I fail at. I've done enough."
"STDS, cancer, depression, anxiety. I just wish I could disappear..","I have multiple incurable STDs and a gynecological cancer. I wish I could just die.. or disappear. I can't seem to bring myself to kill myself. I am worried about leaving my mom and dad and them needing care. I often think about when they pass, I can pass too and join them. I don't feel right being alive. I feel I wasn't meant to me here in this body or whatever. I am not meant to be loved and my body has made sure of that. I have no family beyond my immediate family. I sometimes close my eyes and wish I would just start crumbling away. I hurt so much"
"Dunno what to do, but someone is afraid of me and I'd rather be dead than be someone's bogeyman","She and I were good friends for a while, then I fell in love, then a week later she said no thanks very much, and cut off contact. I knew she'd been going through a really hard time, and the more friends the merrier, so I did my best to fall out of love again, but it was cripplingly difficult. I'd never had any of those feelings before. When I succeeded eventually, I tried to reach out and say that I hoped we could agree to forgive and forget, and that if she ever needs someone to talk to then I remain a friend for my part. But I made some (dumb but understandable) mistakes along the way and she now believes I'm a dangerous psychopathic stalker. I wanted to try and help alleviate some of her troubles and now I'm a cause of them. She's afraid of me. I don't want her to be. I'd rather be dead, and I certainly believe I don't deserve to live after this. If she knew I was dead, she wouldn't be afraid of me, and you don't feel guilty for the death of a monster, but... at the same time I have friends and family who don't think I did anything immoral, and although I don't contribute much to them or to society, I'd be letting them down. I don't know what to do. I just know that if I knew it would make things better for her, I would choose to die. It's been months since I was in love with her, but I love her very much, if that makes any sense. That's something that will never be understood or believed, because sticking someone in the Monster Box and keeping them there is easier than actually forgiving them. :/What would you do if someone you cared about was terrified of you? How could you know that and justify being alive?"
I need some good advice.,I'll just keep this short... lately I've been having a lot of weird suicidal thoughts and feelings. I don't have anyone in life to really talk to. So I just keep it to myself but it's becoming really hard for me to do that.. I just want some general ideas to help me through these times.Thanks everyone
Right now,Bye
I don't know what to do?,"I'm a 31yo male. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 17/18. They sometimes come and go but are mainly based around money. I'm currently in around �8000-�10000 debt. Due to get married in a few weeks and my other half has offered to help. So have family members and I know I'm lucky to have family who can help with no issue or pay back as, they say themselves, are pretty well off but I can't accept their help. I put myself in this position and I need to accept responsibility for and my wrong choices but I'm getting worried that I will never see the day I will be debt free. I know I have had a good job but throughout the years I continually get fed up with the way the world works. Always working to line some else's pockets. Billionaires who toy with companies for tax relief purposes but offer crap wages and try to erode t&c's. I feel I'm about to snap, go away without saying a word and just hanging myself. I feel sorry for the hurt, anger & heartache I will cause but I feel it's the only option I have left now. The world is  a messed up place. "
Update: Not today,I was really hyping this up to myself over the week but my plan got cut short so I have to wait a little longer before carrying on. Whatever.
I just need to talk,"I am a coward in every sense. I hate myself and I dont even have the guts to just fucking kill myself. My parents think im a disappointment. Nothing i ever do is good enough for them. I was supposed to be born a boy, and they resent me for that. Even as a girl,   im a pretty shitty one. People think im a guy even though im not. Im ugly, scrawny, and alone. Im all of my friends second choices. No one talks to me. I live out in the country where i have no neighbors and no friends. Im fucking isolated. My parents want me to be a doctor or lawyer or some shit but what i want to do doesnt matter. My friend left me because he met this girl. She is nice, but he now never talks to me. Being bisexual sucks ass. I love my friend like really love him but im ugly and such a coward that i could never tell him. Ive never been in a relationship and i feel alone. My schoolwork is slowly killing me. I have so much to do but i cant take it anymore. My grades are failing im alone im depressed and too much of a coward to do anything. Goddamn i want to die"
"I wish someone would just mug me and shoot me to death, or get struck by lightning, or get hit by a bus.","I'm too afraid to do it myself, I was close a few times, but couldn't do it. It would hurt my parents too and I think they would think it was their fault and that would hurt them too much. I just want someone to kill me, or to die in a disaster, so that I can die and it won't hurt them quite as much.I've always fantasized about someone stopping me with a gun, asking me for my stuff, maybe I would rush them slow on purpose to get shot. Maybe if I walked out in a thunderstorm I'd get hit. "
Why can't I die?,I'm beyond help and I don't want to get better. I haven't got the strength in me to succeed.Why shouldn't I just end it?
Suicide is an escape but it also shows us the way out of pain.,"I'm not mentally stable or happy since last 8 years. I'm in depression since then. I can't afford to sit idle now. The only thing which is making me live is my mother. I'm living, struggling only because I want to take care of her.She always suggested me not to escape from any situations. But, now I'm sensing it is the only way out for me. I have almost no friends. I can't share my thoughts, regrets or anything with anyone, which I believe is killing me too. I had given 5-6 interviews in last 6 days but no affirmation. Only thing which is killing me is my pathetic sadistic and capricious nature. While I can think that I worth something, most of the times, I believe everyone is living their life perfectly, laughing, enjoying. I don't know what should I do now. It seems ending a life is the final option for me now. "
I want tomorrow to be different,"Since April I've been severely depressed. In the last month I've had a horrible problem getting out of bed. Most days I just spend sleeping--I take sleeping pills throughout the day just to keep myself sedated. I have a lot of work I need to do to finish college, and I have basically given up on it. I don't have any sort of motivation. I can't get myself to do the work. I feel I'm going to fail anyway, so why bother?But I don't want this to be my life. I want to have productive days and achieve things and get out of this hell I've lived for the past ten years of depression. I don't know what I can do to change things. "
I wish I didn't have family so I could just end it already.,"They're the only reason I haven't. Because I know it would destroy them. I'm a selfish person for even seriously contemplating it when I know they care about me.I just don't want to live. I lost the one person who made me happy. My ex and I broke up. I've been depressed most my life. When I met him though, he was unlike any other. I was instantly drawn to him. We hit it off immediately. We fell fast and hard. At least I did. I guess it was all just lie coming from him. He told me he wanted to marry me. He told me my past boyfriends were idiots because they didn't realize what they lost. He told me he loved me more than he's ever loved someone. I felt happy. I felt bliss. I felt like my life had purpose. For a year and a half, it was the greatest experience of my life. We broke up. He told me never completely loved me. He told me he was just mesmerized by having sex with me. Only 6 weeks later and he's in a relationship with another girl. He's crazy about her. He doesn't speak to me. He doesn't miss me. None of this mattered to him. I don't matter to him. I know, it's stupid to want to kill yourself over a boy. I know people will think I'm pathetic for wanting to kill myself because of a break up. But all my life I've been unhappy. For once I found happiness. I think I was better off not knowing what happy felt like because this pain of knowing I'm never going to have him back is unbearable. I just want to die. I keep staring at my wrist. I just want to cut deep and bleed until I stop. Until all of this pain goes away, and I'm nothing. I won't have to deal with this pain ever again. "
Diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'm 16.,"Edit: Thank you!!! Thank you all for the advice that you've given me today, it really has brightened my day! _��_Update: "
"It's all too much. But i wanna have hope, help!","I'm spiraling down again. I was happy in my home country before. I met this guy who actually made me want to have a future (yes i feel like it's lame to rely on someone for happiness). Then i came to australia and cos of depersonalisation or some shit, ended up fucking up that whole thing by kissing a guy here. Now I'm processing all the shit in my life, and i even ended up self harming the other night while drunk. I burnt myself pretty bad. I can't handle the anxiety and depression alone. I don't know what to do. No will to live, but i wanna have hope it will get better. But I've tried so much. I don't know what i should do. Should i go back home and lie in bed, let my mom take care of me (I'm already 24, haven't lived with my parents for 5 years, so feels weird). Or should i stay in australia? It's a once in a lifetime experience. I'm on the working holiday visa, so i won't get that again. Been here 2months. But I'm shit rn mentally. Help pls."
i just want someone to hear me for once,"I was going to write something big but i feel like the amount of unfair shit that happens in my life is just too long to write out so I'll try and just list it out and if you want elaborations just message me or relate message me or something? BTW sorry but it's super long and I didn't mean to.
 -i've tried killing myself once and called the suicide hot line but the lady made me feel like i should kill myself even more
 - my life sucks and I'm almost 20 but treated like a 2 y/o
 -my mother told me i was the biggest disappointment of her life during my hs graduation
 - she tells me i'm ugly and should wear makeup
 -both my parents have called me a bitch and my mom calls me a whore
 - my so called friends are shit
 - my ex and his best friend decided to pull a nasty ass prank on me once which basically resulted in almost slut shamming me and then them telling me they were ""sorry""
 - a friend told me he was ""there for me"" but when i want to talk he doesn't listen and tells me i'm self centered and when he comes over to my house he says he doesn't want to date me and were just friends yet he'll kiss me and cuddle me and hump me
 -my two main guy friends say they're my friends and want to make my summer here good (fyi i'm back for summer since i go to oregon for school now) but they never invite me to do stuff
 - I feel like my moms ways and thoughts are super off from the ""Cool"" kids parents who always get to go out and do stuff all the time
 - Because I'm hardly ever invited to ever go out to parties and do stuff that when I do get invited i jump at the opportunity and my mom tells me i'm easy and stupid for doing that and should say no and make myself hard to get (WTF)
 - Why is it that other girls get to go out and do shit and my ""friends"" will do stuff for these other girls like throw going away parties and birthdays and invite them to do stuff but I NEVER get asked to do anything like this? Like am I not pretty enough? DO i need to be a model or ambassador for a clothing company and be Miss Teen something to get the attention or just simply the level of things these other girls get? And does that make me 'SELF CENTERED' for wanting these things that I never got?!!! Does that make me a bitch?
 -it's constantly having these kinds of things that make me want to kill myself sometimes or just fucking do something that will get me killed because i feel like no one in my life gives a fuck about me and that life defiantly wants to make sure I'm given the most WORST FUCKS EVER. And i have so many more things in my life that are so much worse but i'd probably be writing fucking forever if i said them all.
and then I feel bad for ranting like this because theres a  gazillion other people who probably have it a lot worse but for once can't i just be mad and have a right to feel this way without someone coming to say fucking suck it up cuz your life is basically shit and no one cares and half the people you talk to don't care about your problems and the other half are happy you have them. "
Just giving up.,"Every night I sit on my couch, and clean my pistol on the coffee table. I don't even shoot it anymore, it's not dirty. I give up on living, I'm a career failure. I killed myself before when I was 15, the hospital revived me. 17 years later what's the point anymore. My family has all but given up on me, they havnt spoke to me in years now. Is tonight the night? Maybe.  "
In case someone finds this after i died.,My life doesn't matter please kill me I beg you I beg you so much I have so hard time doing it again after the filed attempt.
"Assisted suicide for people with mental illness needs to be legal, nobody deserves to feel like this.",If you have gone through the process countless times with countless medications that do not work. What's the point of making someone go on the way they are living when all they want to do is die. Why not let them go out on there own terms in a hospital bed surrounded by friends and family that love them instead of sneaking off in the middle of the night to blow their brains out.
Why is the tube the easiest way?,"I don't want to bother people or a poor driver, but I can't see anything easier and less painful "
"I'm all alone, husband didn't come home this night.",I just want to make it through the night. NOt sure if I can. I don't want to die but he's the love of my life. I'm all alone. Please someone talk to me before I do something stupidedit: i wanted to thank everyone who was kind enough to reply. you helped me get through the night. i hope everyone who reads this decides to fight another day. there's kindness in the world.
"Please it hurts, I can't keep living like this","I'm suffocatingI'm wishing things were back to how they were just a few months agoI can't eat or sleep. I've let my classes fail again already because my constant panic attacks keep me crying in my room.I have no friends, she was the only one i needed, I have nobody to talk to and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't blame her, I blame myself for not doing more for her. Now I'm lost.In a few days I might end it, but the wait until then is painful.Please don't go away from me. Please come back. Please stop.I know none of this will happen, but my feelings will never change and they will hurt more and more every day knowing I'm further from you then I was yesterday.I just want to sleep, sleep and not wake up. Please."
I'm just too tired to keep living.,"I go to school during the week and when I'm not at school, I'm working. I'm facing a criminal charge that could (and will likely) end in me going to jail. I'm fucking 3 months sober and they say being sober is supposed to help you when it just makes everything worse. I'm too scared to do anything and I can't stop crying. I'm so FUCKING tired. I'm tired of living, being alive. And I can't believe I'm bitching about this on Reddit. I'm fucking pathetic and a sorry excuse for a person."
I want to leave something behind.,"I'm 17. I love baking pastries. I love doing live theater. I love my cats: Parker, a beautiful calico kitty with a half face, she drools when she's happy. Her brother Cloud, my sweet baby, a flamepoint siamese who is white with a pink nose and blue eyes. He loves chewing on hair. Percy, our big boy, who is a siamese. He loves dog food. Little Gal, our tiny ruler. She is a tabby and likes to steal food. I love my sister, even though she is busy a lot and can't talk. I love my 15 year old brother, even though we're not on good terms and don't really talk to each other despite living together. I love my mama. She loves me. I don't know what has been happening recently, we've been drifting and fighting a lot. I love her. I only have one friend, Madi. She is amazing. Without her I would sit alone every day and do nothing, I'm so grateful for her. I'm also so tired. I can't do this anymore. I wrote this to leave something of me behind. Thanks for listening."
I really hope that when we die we just pass on to another universe and restart,I like to think that too. Sometimes I imagine dying and starting life over as a different person somewhere around the world.
Rip - 13/09/2017,"19 years ago i was born. What did i accomplish in life ? 3 years without school or a job / income. Never ever even spoke to a girl in my life except primary school never mind a relationship / sex. No human communication for months at a time. Never had a friend in my life. Bullied in school dropped out with 0 qualifications. Family abadoned me 2yrs ago. Took out loans i knew i was never gonna be able to repay, now in debt to my neck and homeless. I have OCD, DPDR and Schizophrenia. I have booked a cheap flight to another country and local transport to a popular suicide spot, where i will hang myself and set myself on fire. No one will ever know about me.
Bye :("
Hate myself for it,"I kissed another person during the 2 1/2 years my boyfriend and I were together. He lives in Britain and I live in California. We always made communication work when one day he drops off the map and for 2 weeks doesn't talk to me. I lean to my guy best friend for support and he kisses me, I kiss back. I hate myself and it was the biggest mistake I've ever made. My self hatred is through the roof and my depression is at an all time low. I don't know what to do.  People at my work are talking about it and I brush it off ass a rumour but every time people ask it pushes me closer. I've tried to kill myself in the past but this is a new low for me. I threw my blades away ages ago but times like now I wish I hadn't..  I love my boyfriend and he's the best thing in my life. He's a blessing and I can't lose him so I haven't told him. A close family friend said that living with the guilt is punishment enough, I've devoted myself to being the person he deserves but I keep breaking down. I am a piece of trash human being and I hate myself"
I'm fading to dust.,This must end soon.
I need Help saving my friend,"so i've recently reconnected with one of my old friends, we went to homecoming, have been hanging out a lot yada yada yada all that jazz. but i'm really worried because she is planning to kill herself. ive managed to convince her to not do it but i'm not sure how long that will last, she has this bucket list of things she has to do and after she completes it she is going to swallow a bottle of pills, well atleast she was but i made her give the pills to me. but she could always get more. what do I do? i can't loose her, and nobody is taking her seriously. every time she says she's going to kill herself people are like ""lol mee too school is so stressful"" so what do I do? do i call the hotline, do i tell all my teacher, do I try to get her parents attention? how can i stop her before it's too late? time is precious so please reply sooner that later.Thanks,

"lost my aunt to cancer, possibly my cousin in the near future, and my soulmate just walked out of my life.","original post:
i've been depressed since i was 15. its not the classic self harm depression, but more internal and cerebral self harm. but at the same time i feel like i can turn it off and be ""presentable"" and ""normal"", which gives me a perfect facade for friends. only about 3 people in my life know about my suicidal thoughts and depression, and one of them, the girl of my dreams and my soulmate, has fallen out of love with me. i dont want the classic ""its going to get better"", ""after the ONE is the next one"" bullshit. im scared of taking my life  because i know i can be someone, i have the talent (music) to make it, but at the same time i just... idk. in high school, my english teacher said that suicide was selfish and that anyone that does it is an idiot because they dont think of the people who love them. for 2 years ive been in denial of this but i think its true now. im a selfish fucking person and i have people who love me, im popular, im a good guy. but what is it worth if i feel like i shouldnt be on this planet? ive been talking too long so ill stop"
A joke,"Today in one of my classes I turned to my friend and said, ""I want to kill myself"", she looked at me, smiled and replied, ""oh same, I hate this class"", then she laughed.Once I actually do, she'll see it wasn't a joke."
Should I kill myself?,"Zero money, in a job that barely pays my bills, don't want to experience this headspace anymore. I'm tired of feeling suicidal. It's been over 20 years. "
Am I or am I not suicidal?,"I think about suicide a lot. Not necessarily doing it though, just suicide in general. I think about ways of doing it. I think about what it would be like if I did. I think about how common and easy it would be. I don't sit here and tell myself I'm going to do it though.About me: I'm 19. I've graduated highschool in 2016 with grades above average. Hated school. Still do, I haven't started college yet. Instead I've been working for 10 months at a nearby retail store. I live with my grandparents, so I have no bills to pay. I've just been saving up money. I'm blessed I should say. My dad works nearly nonstop. My mom died when I was 4. What I do when I'm not working, is working on music. I've been making alternative/electronic music since the age of 15 and right now I'm working towards having my debut studio album released. It's not happening anytime soon though. My dad and I are trying to build a studio at his house, but due to how much he works, and how much it costs to redo an entire room from the bone, all I can do is continue to write material for it and expand on arranging the songs. Anyways, back to my issue.  I'm not depressed, I don't think anyways. I'm not sad, nothing is bothering me, nobody is abusing me. I simply think about suicide a lot, and not on purpose. I don't know if it's a subconscious thing and I'm soaking up toxicity from something or if I'm just interested in death. I tend to make jokes a lot. Not jokes about suicide but jokes about me, personally, myself, committing suicide. For example just recently at work my coworker was flipping a coin, and he accidentally let it go to the ground and before he could check it I quickly said ""If it's heads I go to the break room and kill myself!"" and he shot me a shocked/concerned look. I wonder why... But anyways as soon as I said that even I was like wow did I really just say that? 4 times now I've received either the suicide prevention lifeline number from my friends or simply them reaching out and offering support if I need it.I'm kind of concerned that this is only going to get worse, and during yet another time I'm staring at my bottle or aspirin or the bottle of bleach I have on my windowsill above my bed, thinking about how ""I could do it right now if I wanted to."" that I really am just going to do it, and like the jokes I make, be surprised that I did it and regret it (Assuming its something that's not instant). I am a huge mess, but I know I have the capability to become a much better person. Would it be worth it if I did though? Would a haircut, a shave, a shower, a new set of clothes, a new attitude and a new work ethic have any impact on this at all? I don't know I'm just rambling now so I'm gonna stop here. What do I do? I feel as if there's some kind of demon or other thing that's controlling my mind. I don't WANT to kill myself but I'm talking, thinking, and acting like I do and I don't know why. - I'm not depressed, stressed, or angered by anything yet I think about suicide in general quite often. I don't know why I do, and I'm concerned for my own being."
"24, ptsd, suicide is seeming like the practical and economic decision","Girlfriend of three years broke up with me last month, I've been staying with my abusive family members since. It's going to take at least three months of me living here before I've saved up enough for my own housing and transportation. I could probably have a gun tomorrow. I've been in therapy for like 7 years, the other day i had a physician tell me i was ""refractory to treatment"" and he refused to become involved in my care. Feeling pretty hopeless. Girlfriend was more or less all i had and my mental illness drove her away. No friends to depend on, family is actively making things worse. I live in a state with abysmal mental health care. I've reached out to all of the major institutions at some point and haven't gotten the help i need.  Once when i was being taken to psychiatric hold i told a paramedic i was ""sorry but I'm not going inpatient in [my state]"" the paramedic responded by grabbing my hand and saying ""i know"". I'm excited to stop struggling. Honestly, not existing sounds more wonderful than any future i can imagine. I want to stop suffering. Being as mentally ill as i am i know I'm not ever going to stop suffering. I'm never going to be gifted the ability emotionally regulate like a normal person. Everyday life events are excruciating, and frankly, the constant emotional pain makes my quality of life indefensible. Pretty sure i would qualify for euthenasia at this point if i was living in the Netherlands. Don't even know why I'm posting this"
I feel like a parasite,"My happiness relies mostly on others and it's been this way as long as I can remember being depressed. Some background, I'm a 19 year old woman that has suffered with severe depression and anxiety for almost ten years.

I feel like I have no purpose no matter what I end up doing. When you're depressed this long, your interests and ambitions have long disappeared along with your happiness, which fucking sucks. My life is going absolutely nowhere in a job or education sense.
I've been seeing a man for a few months now, we'd been friends for over two years before this. I love him more than anything but it's so draining because I feel like I'm only existing for him. His life is progressing beautifully and I feel like I'm holding him down. I've fucked up a lot of people's minds in the past when it comes to my suicidal tendencies and I absolutely cannot hurt him like that. It's driving me mad that I have to deal with these emotions day in and day out.
I feel like I'm wasting his time, and I just want him to be happy. Even if I ended up staying alive I don't think I could fulfill the happiness he deserves. He's the most beautiful and compassionate person I've met in my life and the last thing I want to do is traumatize him.
I hate being stuck. I wish I could just get in a fatal car accident so no one would feel like they were to blame. Or maybe I'm just delaying the inevitable. Maybe I should just take the plunge. I'm tired of feeding off of people.  Words"
Invasive thoughts,"I have been depressed for a long time.  I'm sure everyone on this thread has.  I'm on antidepressants and they don't seem to be working that well.  I'm materially fairly successful, married, and have a kid, but I keep getting invasive thoughts about killing myself.  It goes to show, I guess, that mental illness doesn't care about what you have.  I know there are people here who might think they wouldn't be depressed if they had ""that one thing"" their missing in their lives, but I'm telling you that with depression, it's totally meaningless because you can enjoy that stuff anyway.  Lately I've been having almost daily experiences/stressors that send me off on a tangent mentally, into a realm of mental anguish and pain where I eventually wind up thinking about killing my self obsessively.  I think about how to do it, the best method, plan it, tell myself it's the right thing to do, and then curse myself for being too afraid.  I feel like I'm living in my own personal hell.  Have any of you been able to get rid of these thoughts?  How do you silence your own minds?"
I think about killing myself everyday at work.,"I used to think about it once every few months, just in passing. But since I started working full time it's been more frequent until it became a daily thing. I thought it was fine, until it started following me home. My job isn't even that hard or taxing, it's just a nine-hour shift (hour long lunch -I can leave the building- that's off the clock so 8 paid hours) decent pay, good benefits, so I really shouldn't be having these thoughts.Its even affecting my enjoyment of things, I can't even enjoy games anymore, as it stands the only thing that I do enjoy now is writing shitty fanfiction, and the feedback I get for that. ... What should I do? "
I'll be gone soon,"So as the months pass by I stay looking to this topics and remember the way I felt when I tried to suicide myself and gone to hospital for 2 weeks. Tried to recover and trying to move forward... I just can't, and I'm so done of my fking life, pretending that everything is gonna be ok, but is a lie. Happiness it's not for all. In a few days I will die for sure, until then I will just drink to make the illusion I'm not hurt. Sorry to write here... but I can't tell to anyone close to me... I survived once by taking lot of pills. This time I will just shoot in the head, no mercy for shit. Sorry to wasting your time reading this..."
Forced Medical Leave from College 3 Years Ago I Will Never Recover From- Need to Die,"3 years ago I was forced against me and my parents' will to take a medical leave from my dream college. It was a prestigious school that I worked my ass off in high school to get into, sacrificing a social life for grades/extracurriculars because I wanted so bad to get into a good college and have a great experience. Halfway into the school year I started getting very depressed and became anorexic but was seeking help outside the school for both these problems and was hopeful of my recovery. That was, until one of my teachers expressed concern about my weight to administration. What followed was months of back and forth harassment, threats, forced tests and evaluations that cost my parents money out of pocket, etc. including mandatory ""weekly meetings"" with one of the deans only to culminate in them forcing me to take a medical leave.I was in a certain program in this school where basically if I were to leave I would lose my spot in the program and have to start all over (more time at the school, more money for my parents, same classes over, bullshit). I had literally chosen that school because of the prestige of this program and the first year was a sort of ""preparation"" for the program and I already had befriended people in the group, was excited that all my hard work first year would finally pay off. It was really really stressful for me and my family and when I tried to go back the next semester, my application was 'denied' and I was still prevented from returning. Next semester- same thing. I have literally not recovered from this event and it has ruined my entire life and even health. Since this happened I've developed severe, life-altering chronic pain leaving me bedridden that therapists tell me is from the stress/anger of that situation. Both my mom and dad have developed emotional issues/anxiety having to watch me suffer. The dr bills that are a result of this event have piled up for my poor parents. I have watched all of my friends recently graduate and move on with their lives while I'm completely stuck. I had such a bright future, and it's literally gone. I'm so sick mentally and physically I can't work, and I'm so angry I could literally see myself murdering the people at that school that so unfairly did that to me (And still wouldn't let me return!!!)I cannot see any way out. I've been completely isolated from every human but my parents and doctors for the past three years. I haven't gone out with any friends or done anything a normal young person should do in all this time. I see zero future for myself without a degree and no clear path. And, the pain prevents me from even holding the most easy of jobs. There's legitimately no way out for me anymore. I've held on so long and I can't anymore. Fuck this world, the phony people incapable of empathy and understanding, and the unfairness that permeates through innocent people's lives and souls."
As I sit,"As I sit my stomach turns, my life crumbles around me as the people continue on their day. The gun up against my head my life flashes before my eyes just like what I imagined. I've done it all, I've given everything I have, but you get to a point where you can't give anymore. You will find this one day Mom and you will know who I am. I am the person who you thought was so smart but ended up so dumb. How is it that everyone else around me is succeeding and I'm struggling to put food in my stomach? How is it that I can have all this brain power and not get past something as simple as eating? You'd think I would have figured out a way to just make it appear. You think I could stop being such a failure. You were wrong. I can't eat, I can't stay where I am. I've tried. How can everyone love me but nobody actually loves me? How is it that my father can up and leave for dead but a child that isn't even his can be such a prized possession. How can my Brother judge me for things I do, yet, when I'm desperate for just a meal he turns me away. I'm starving Mom, I can't do it anymore.All I needed was a friend, all I needed was a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not an infinite source of love and when everyone takes and takes and takes and you get nothing in return you break down, you lose hope. I've lost hope Mom. For months my days have shortened, I've lost my will to live and it's world breaking, you think you understand but you don't. My heart says no, don't do it, it'll get better, but I know this path that I'm heading down and there isn't anything left for me, I'm dry and I can't refill this time. I was hopeful for so long, I hope you know that. I was that ball of energy you knew and loved, but it's not enough,  everyone needs more and more, they take and they take and they take but they never give back, I just needed someone to give back a little. Du hast mich Mama, ich liebe dich."
How do I tell my therapist I'm want to kill myself,"I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and in the last week, I've gotten into a major depressive suicidal slump. This post isn't about stopping that, I just don't know how to word it with my therapist"
I've burned everything around me,"I'm not the usual one to wax poetic about my suicidal thoughts, but thought this might be a good platform to spew a little bit. I've been suicidal for years, and yet the past few weeks really seem like a ""sign"" that it is time to go.1) I have destroyed my relationship with the one I love, by not being there emotionally, and by my actions. It's to the point where her 13 year old brother is angry at me for not being more responsible (I put her in an unsafe situation).2) My car has completely broke down, and I do not have the funds to replace it, which means that I have no means of transportation of getting to and from work.3) I've been missing more and more days of work. Management may fire me any day from now. My only source of income.4) My family is upset because they do not know how to handle me. I've never been more distant from them.5) My friends are angry at me as well, for multiple reasons. I have nobody I can confide in.6) I went to my doctor today to pour out my feelings, he prescribed me antidepressants and sent me away.7) I start school again next week, and I can't even concentrate on writing this post, let alone study.8) My physical health is deteriorating, and I am in constant physical pain. I also have been struggling with insomnia, and cry myself to sleep every night.I have been a dick, but I feel like karma is hitting me with full force, or there is a sign out there that it's time for me to go. I've tried everything, meditation, exercise, sleeping more, confiding in others to help, but I feel like the more I am in peoples lives at this point, the more I am burning them. I don't know what to do. Every day I wake up, life is throwing something else at me, and I keep making the wrong decisions. I've never been more ready to die, and yet I'm still too cowardly to go through the act. I just want the pain to stop. I want to stop being a cancer in other peoples lives. There's nothing worse than ruining someone else's life. It's one thing to ruin yours, but to ruin somebody else's, is a feeling of guilt and pain that I don't know what to do with. I have tried apologizing, but every time I come back, I find a way to make things worse. I'm so scared, and in so much pain. "
Apparently I'm hated/not welcome anywhere.,"In a matter of 3 months, I got kicked out from every forum and abandoned by every friend.Up to yesterday I was staff in a website, today I get kicked out and framed. Since I was pissed I deleted some of the files on the FTP but they changed the ip and restored everything. I realized I would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via FTP but I didn't realize that  until after. I got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff. For example in one of them, I created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own. That caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales. I felt better that he couldn't monetize from that any longer. This led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do, or actual staff applications. Another forum incident was, I was selling another one of my programs, of course no license since I'm lazy to add that in. This guy buys it, and shares the license with his friend. Once something went wrong with the program, he , his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down. Then he demanded I help him and his friends and I refused due to him breaking my purchase policies. The staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refunding/fixing his program.For the friend part, I stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them ( 3-4 ). In short, I realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me. I like being kind of a leader, saying what to do , what not to do and what I should do instead of them. Such as, let's drop there ( PUBG ) or let me be that character since you don't really know how to use it ( rainbow six siege ). All my online friends found other friends to talk to / play with/ code with. My best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me. The only times he invites me out, I actually can't meet him due to me being with my girlfriend ( being the weekends. )Basicly now I have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code. But what is the point of coding if I can't sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums. I go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am. The only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap. She basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted. I don't know why on the contrary everyone else hates me and wants me to be gone. Being hated by everyone means I can't sell my creations or have anything to talk about with anyone. On the forums part I can't let anyone take advantage of me and step on me and control what I do. What is wrong with me in your opinion? I really want to get better and be liked by the majority rather than hated by the majority."
"I feel like i can't go any further, i just can't go on...","21 years. For 21 years i've been a burden for my parents, a waste of time, effort and money, in this time i haven't nor i think i could in the future give them anything back, something to make them feel all the trouble was worth it and the only thing i can offer them back is what they gave me, they gave me life and i should return it back to them, ending the burden and removing a huge weight from their shoulders. But that isn't the whole reason i'm probably doing this, it's also because i'm an ugly motherfucker, a mental illness bin, a social inept, a friendless loser, a virgin and a useless shit. Honestly i've already given up on getting a girlfriend, i never had one and i'll never have because of my ugliness and shit personality, not even tinder can help me up, i'll never have children, i don't even want to, i don't want to pass down my depression, anxiety, ugly, fucked up immune system genes, no, no child should carry this. I made some friends in high school, how i don't know, but after graduating when my depression got to its worst most abandoned me during my 2 years of recovery that followed, only 3 of them cared enough to send me a facebook message from time to time, but out of this 3, 2 barely speak to me now and 1, who i thought i could trust entirely, stopped talking to me after almost confessing to her that i was going to try to kill myself yesterday, i feel devastated, all i wanted was someone i could talk to, someone to help me. 3 times i've already tried to end it all, yesterday's was the third and as i promised myself the last, the next one, this one has to be the one. After what has happened i don't want to go back with my family, i don't want them to see me depressed again, after 2 long anguishing years of attempted recovery, i don't want any more pills and talks with my psychiatrist, i don't want to go every two weeks with a psychologist to tell me what to do and what to don't, i'm tired of all this, i don't want to ""get better"" again for no reason, i don't want to keep trying to fit in this decaying society, to live in a world going to shit and resisting any change, i'm tired of being myself, i'm tired of not having anything to look forward to, having no plans, no anything, of seeing no light at the end of the tunnel despite my efforts.Someone please help me, i just want to go back when everything was cheerfulness, when my mother sang me lullabies and i was safe from everything, when i played in the mud carelessly, when ignorance was bliss, when i was happy. "
Due to teen life I can only do it when I move out but I want to now!,"What's the point of going through this entire hell that is school just to kill myself afterwards? I know this seems like it works against me, but I want to die more than just about anything and if I have to, I will. But preferably I'll die now.We do have pills and vodka at my place (before you ask, no my parents aren't heavy drinkers. I can't remember the last time I saw them drink.) but I'm not sure how reliable that is."
I don't deserve the life I have,"Honestly, I have a fantastic support structure, a small number of close friends, a caring partner, and access to healthcare, but I still feel so miserable. I don't deserve all the shit I have. I'm miserable regardless of what anyone does."
How to kill myself?,"I just, idk where to start (and i see no point in explaining this), but i know my final question to this: How do I kill myself? I don't wanna attempt to do it and fail... Idk where to go to jump off somewhere high around here... I really want to end it fast. Is it fucked up to ask others about this? Think that you'll put someone's suffering and dullness at ease finally... I understand if this will get deleted or something, yet I wish it didn't, so I'd finally get an answer."
What's the point of living when you're gonna die eventually !?,"One way or another,
Don't know when,
Just that death is going to happen someday and there's no stopping it from happening.Might as well try to kill myself now before something or someone brings me to my death first."
I feel bad for those who care about me.,"I feel bad for the people who waste their time on me - I've been completely fucked for years and yet there are still people who remain around me by choice despite myself, and how I've treated them.That's not really why I feel bad though. I feel bad because I know eventually that I'm going to end my life. Not today, maybe not even soon, but to me saying I'm gonna end up dead by my own hand is like saying water is wet or the sky is blue. I feel bad for these people because they hold out hope that my opinions on life will change and that one day I'll be happy and have the things I clamor for... it will never happen, either because of its inherent impossibility or because I will prevent it by killing myself.I'm not even remotely upset while typing this, which further cements how much I believe this. It doesn't even scare me, it's just reality. "
I thought i get better but i am extremly stressful right now and about to kill myself because of my first job,Hi 23/m from a 3rd world country. I got my first job at a supermarket and job is not even started yet. But i am extremly stressful and about to kill myself. I have ocd and depression. I am using meds over a year now and i thought i get better. But apparently i am not. My mood is keep changing between suicidal and careless. Can anyone give me any advice ?
Sad,"i think about how embarassing and stupid and cringy i am a lot and want to just get rid of myself so that i dont have to be stupid anymore whenever im outside and i listen to whats in my youtube history, I can't stop thinking about how stupid it is and how mentally slow i am and that I'm like a little kid and i have to resist the urge to scratch and draw bloodAnd when I shuffle through my playlist i remember how i played this one song to show off and i want to punch myself in the facei wish my mom was one of those 'autisum moms' and that she would be the type of mom who got so fed up with her kid that she would kill them so that i wouldn't live knowing im an embarassmentso im sad"
Lately I've had a problem,"A lot of kids know what they want to be when they grow up. It usually changes by the time they get there but usually if people have a passion they can stick with it. Others can't say they have a passion so they're confused about what to do with their lives. I seem to have a different problem. While I accept that I am by no stretch of the imagination a tragic person, I wrestle with the certainty that I'll never know everything I want to know. I don't just want to be a doctor or a lawyer, I want to be a linguist. I want to be a chemist, a physicist, an historian, and marine biologist. I want to be a philosopher and a world traveler and a surfer and everything in between. On a daily basis this is fine because what I want changes from day to day. Some days everything else falls away and medieval poetry fills my view. Other days it's illegal drugs or covert military operations. One time it was hypnosis and I spent three hours reading the entire Wikipedia page for it and looking for psychologists who've written on it. This is all fine because my sporadic learning is financially supported by my mom and dad. But what happens once I grow up? What happens I have bills to pay? I want to see every country, speak every language, climb every mountain, and taste every rainbow. But I can't do that if I'm forced to survive instead of live. I am mortally terrified that no life, no living arrangement, no outcome or possibility waiting for me in all of reality will ever make me happy. I used to be able to ignore this feeling but it's been getting stronger. I have no idea what to do. My problem isn't that I don't have any passion, it's that I have too much. I know I'm only 17, but what do I do?"
What is the art in making friends?,"Hey fam. As the title states, I've always had trouble making friends, in high school, sure I hung out with some people but the moment school ended I never spoke to them til the next day. I'm in college now, and I thought these problems would just go away and they didn't. I'm now into my 2nd year of college and I literally have no friends. There are days that go by and I get no texts from anyone. I try so hard to come across as a funny and interesting guy, but it always feels like I'm the one pushing to make friends. How does it come so easy for everyone else? I eat all my meals at the dining hall alone, sit by myself in classes and nobody's taken the initiative to get to know me.  Honestly, it's gotten to the point where I could care less about having some ""good bros"" I just feel like I'm missing out on so much in life. I've never had any luck with girls, and it just seems like I'm a shell of a person, always just going through the motions, never anything palpable. I was thinking about hitting up that tinder grind but with my severe social anxiety/depression I'm apprehensive.  But hey, I just wanted to see what recommendations you guys have for enjoying this shitty life.  "
I don't see the point anymore,"My love for everything I care about is decaying, and it feels like life has to constantly remind me of my place in this world.I'm pretty much a sub-human, being 5'7 and balding. Born in a poor family, pretty much didn't know my dad in the first years of my life while he was selling drugs and my mom took care of 3 of us on welfare. I ended up dropping out high school at 13, did a lot of things I shouldn't have done. School felt like prison. Now l'll never amount to anything or have any money.I don't have anything to hang on for, no goals, nothing. Sex and drugs aren't helping, only hurting my thoughts and making them more morose than they already are.I think it might just be time to end it now. "
Death Makes Me Happy,The thought of myself dying makes me happy planning to kms. My only reason to live is to wait for Destiny 2 to release on PC
I don't deserve to live.,"I'm a shitty human being. All I have ever done is caused harm wherever I go. I've tried changing, but I just get worse. It would be in my best interest to do the world a favour, and just kill myself. I've tried before and I lost a lot of blood and I was permanently scarred due to my incompetence; but I won't mess up this time around.If anyone of my family finds this, I'm sorry for being a horrible brother and son. I hope you can forgive me eventually, I know you will call me selfish and won't understand why I did what I did. To my exes, I'm sorry for not being the man that I said I was. I lied to everyone. I lied about everything, especially with regards to how I'm doing in life. If you want me to be honest, no I'm not okay. I never have been. Ever. Don't ever think I will be, and at this point in time I don't see a benefit to me continuing to be a burden to society.All I ever wanted was to be happy, I guess this is the next best thing."
Question about this site,"I make a post, get some lovely comments, then go back a few hours later and they are almost always removed! Is it the commenters or site moderators? Are comments temporary? What's going on? "

Anxiety-fuelled suicidal thoughts,"I've struggled with anxiety for much of my life and it has brought me to the edge of suicide on a few occasions. (I never made any actual attempts. I just had very clear plans that I backed out of at the last or nearly last moment.) When I was 16, I thought I wouldn't live to see 20. At 20, I thought I'd be dead by 25. At 25, the age moved back to 30. Now, at 29, I don't expect to kill myself imminently, but I believe it will be how I die. Finally, after 29 years, I realized that my anxiety brings me here. The fear and worry just grips my mind and won't let go. Either I fear so much about what is happening or I worry so much about what will happen, I start to feel as if suicide is the only way to save me from myself. Two weeks ago I almost made this post. I was in a dark place. I held off. Later, I recovered. That lasted about four days. Now I'm back right where I left off. Afraid, worrying, wanting to escape. The last time I had a plan. I planned to jump of a bridge nearby where I live, a bridge that many people have successfully used to kill themselves in the past. Last time I also tried to put my affairs in order before I killed myself. Now, my plan is still valid and my affairs are still in order. I don't think I'll kill myself tonight. I feel I'll kill myself soon. I have often felt that way though. The frequency with which I feel like killing myself makes me not want to seek help for it. Why worry others when I know I won't do it? But I feel like I will do it. Maybe not tonight, but soon. I'm not sure where this post is heading. It would be helpful for me to hear how others deal with suicidal thoughts driven by their own anxiety. Again, I don't want to die. Like many here, I just don't want to live like this. "
Unemployment Blues: why don't I feel like doing much to help myself??,"I lost my job in July (bit of a blessing in disguise there, as it was as a cashier at Walmart, a shit place to work if ever there was one) and have been unemployed since.  They fought my unemployment money so that never arrived after I applied.  Just fucking hate them; I'm disabled with CP and Walmart as a rule seems not to give a shit about ADA, they fought (and thankfully lost) against each of my ""reasonable"" accommodations and in general were indifferent and uncaring to my physical and mental suffering at their hands.But enough about all that, thinking about them at all just infuriates me more.  I'm 26 and without a job.  Fortunately I had built up a bit of a financial cushion so I'm not entirely in dire straits yet.  Thing is, I've dealt with pretty severe clinical depression for most of my life and even attempted suicide in March (after my managers threatened to fire me after I was scammed several hundred dollars in prepaid cards by a group of known criminals).So here I am, two months out and losing hope of finding full-time employment quickly enough that my current cash doesn't run out.  I cannot stand for long, so that rules out most fast food places...not that I'd want to lower myself to that--I have a four-year English BA, for god's sake!!  My options, with no real experience in my chosen field, are unfortunately quite slim.I'm just getting tired again and apathetic about continuing to search for anything meaningful out there on the Internet job boards.  I'm on a new antidepressant (again)  and it's actually working most of the time; it takes the edge off, at least.  It would buoy me up to a level plateau (AKA, ""normal""), whereas before, I was mostly in the deep dark pit and it was an effort to even rise to that ""normal"" level, to say nothing of anything about it.So, I'm just getting worn out yet again.  I know I NEED to be really looking for a job...but I just can't muster the willpower.  Most days, I'm in bed until ten or later, and then I'll catch a nap around two or so in the afternoon, wake up again around five or six and stay up until two or three (or later) in the morning.  Rinse, repeat."
I would would make a throwaway but I don't anyone will find this...,"J can't complain too much but I do. Today at dinner that my ex-fianc̩e (will explain) took me out to (will explain) I said something profound, at least to myself. ""I'm being destroyed by apathy, driven by anxiety, and for depression everyday."" I actually just lost someone, my cousin only a few years older than me, due to a bullet in his head that he placed there. Which made me to say another profound thing at this date of disaster.""I really don't care about others or understand why I feel the ways I feel, I only last my grandma a few months ago and doesn't care but cried over my cousin when I never spoke to him"" Which I've been thinking a lot about I have no friends (which I hate) and just moved starts away from all my family! I don't know if I love anyone, how can I when I constantly hate myself. I contemplate suicide a lot for stupid small things but for big things I usually just break down into an anxiety filled seizure or depression laced nap. I really just don't know what to think about life or myself or this cruddy situation. "
Sometimes I feel really suicidal,"I was diagnosed with ADHD half a year ago but I feel like it is too late to get things straight. I have been taking medication but I think we need many years to catch up so I think I will suffer after graduation.Besides that I have no friends. I think quite a number of people in my major are avoiding me and being short with me. Maybe I depended on the acquaintances for help too many times and missed too many classes and had to WhatsApp them asking if there are schedule changes and they don't like how I have the management skills of a 12 year old.I feel like we will be forever inferior to neurotypicals and that we will never be accepted by society and it makes me want to die. As some people have said, they aren't exactly supportive of us having kids as we are just passing it on to the second generation and causing them to suffer for a lifetime."
"My guitar is the only thing that is keeping me alive....(Cheesy, I know. sorry.)","My family is in debt because of my father. He refinanced the house, and used the money for his mistresses (yes, that bastard had more than one mistress at the same time). He passed away last year. He may be dead, but the debt is still yet to be settled.Now here I am, broke, unemployed and a disappointment to my family. I spent my savings on trying to make something of my life with music, where I formed a few bands and hoped to become a full time musician. Alas, none of them worked out, due to the bandmembers either being too playful or no commitment at all.I'm unemployed because I tried to get myself a typical 9-5 job. I did get one, but it only lasted about 5 months, because of how horrible the working environment is, and its messing up my peace of mind.My family was a bit disappointed when I made that decision because I am unable to force myself to work, just for the sake of salary. Sometimes I hate that fact as well. But what can I do, its just my personality, I guess. Now here I am, sitting in front of my computer, with nothing left for me to lose except my life, and pondering on the remains of my enthusiasm towards life.The six strings in my room is probably the only thing that acts as a mental painkiller for me, but I dont even know how long it can last. Its a shame that my country is against euthanasia, else I probably would've resort to that without blinking an eye.Heh........maybe I should borrow some money from my siblings. Go to Canada, and get the injection and just be done with it. That's probably on my list, yeah.....Anyway, sorry for the long post. Thank you so much for reading this."
Don't know how much longer I can take this,"I'm 24M, have completely failed at dating the past few months (I can count the number of dates I've had in the past 2 months on one hand, my last sort-of relationship was back in April this year). It's just been rejection after rejection. Everyone I meet either loses interest and ghosts (probably for someone with not nearly as many red flags as me), or just bolts after one date and says something like ""it was nice meeting up with you, you're sweet but I don't want to meet again"" which really means that they saw seriously wrong with me but didn't want to let me down too hard. I just don't know if life is worth living if nobody will give me a chance. Some people say it gets better for guys as they get closer to 30 but to be honest I'd be devastated if I only finally had my first long-term relationship after 30."
It's back and Unwelcomed,It was two days... it lasted two days of being fine but now the thoughts are back. It's turning me into a bitter person. Like idk why. I just don't want to die but I don't want to exist and I am dying inside. My head is like a prison. I don't want to end it but I can't help fantasize it.. it's sick and I really don't have anyone to talk to about it. No one knows and if I told them (friends and family) they wouldn't be able to handle it. I am the rock.
Successful Suicide,I have 2g of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride and 21g of bupropion.  Will that be sufficient to shut my body down?  Will I need more of something?  I am of slightly larger than average body size.  I want to get this right.  Just trying to do the old go to sleep and never wake up thing.  Thanks!
I'm close to my breaking point.,I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia but I never told my family. My fear is that it'll blown out of proportion and make the situation worse. My school life has made my life even worse to the point where I thought of suicide. I felt like scum throughout my school year to the point that I ask my self whats the point of living. If you have any tips please tell me. I don't be a burden to those that I love and those that I care about.
I don't think I can live the double life anymore.,"Thanks for giving me your precious time.
I'm an Asian that was raised born in Saudi Arabia in a fairly strict Muslim household. I was living ""normally"" until in 2015 I began questioning my faith, Islam. It was recently 9 months ago where I had the courage to completely renounce it.Now, I feel depressed and oppressed. Because I look different, I've always been bullied by the local kids for my looks from elementary to highschool, both verbally and physically. I'm also Bisexual, which makes it all the worse. So I'm living as an in-closet atheist and bi. Why not come out?Because I'd be given the death sentence if they found out, that if my own family didn't kill me first.Even with all that, I had managed to always ace my exams and top my classes. I even got enrolled into Medicine and got a perfect GPA(5/5) in my first year at the university. But then, slowly, I fell into depression and my grades suffered a lot. My GPA went all the way down to 3.1/5 and I even failed a whole year. You can imagine what an Asian parent would do if their child failed at college.I'm positive that both my parents are narcissists.
My mom keeps telling me that she ""owns"" me because she gave birth to me. My dad took away all my savings(over 2k$) because in Islam it's permissible to do that. There's an Islamic script(Hadith) allowing it: ���You and your wealth belong to your father�۝, narrated by Abu Dawood (3530) and Ahmad (6640) . But I secretly opened a bank account and started over from the beginning. Although I don't have much in it right now..And my mom has been forcing me to go to the mosque 5 times a day, everyday. I've been putting up with it for so long and i can't take it any longer. She even forbid me from listening to music..My chest is heavy all the time except while spending time with my friends. I have a few good IRL's and a bunch of internet friends that keep me in check. I really wish if I could run away..
My original plan was to finish medicine, and use my degree to work somewhere else. But that'd take up to 6 years.. And I don't think I can pass it in my current mental state anyways.Please, if you know a way for me to move out and run away tell me about it. I really need it. Thanks."
Is it worth to kill myself,"Brief background on me: I'm 15 this year, and suffer from depression. I have a dark history with 'family and friends' and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Life's been a bitch to me, my studies have gone haywire, I'm losing friends and I think too much about murder and suicide. I feel that suicide while bringing someone down with me is my only way out. Help.If it helps, I live life without a care anymore. Since life is a bitch to me, might as well don't give it any more chances.Edit: Since i have nothing to lose, might as well leave my life story here.I was a very well behaved kid from age 1-6. Then it all changed. My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless. Now I'm Secondary 3(15), today I'm accused of being a stalker, I'm getting blocked, and time is running out. My murderous mind is going crazy, I nearly leapt today. Close friend stopped me. One day I'm gonna be outta friends. That is when I know I'm a definite goner. Please. Help me for god's sake."
I feel like shit,I've exhausted all of my friends with my constant problems and I can't feel anything without cutting. I just feel like dying
I want to be alone.,"Whenever I do not want to be alone, I end up by myself with no one to talk to.The time I do want to be alone, I find myself with so many great friends who don't deserve me, they don't need me, I'm just extra weight holding them back from great things- once I'm gone they'll achieve much more than what they have while being friends with me."
I'm not sure where to put this but it looks like this person needs help, has been posting suicidal things as of late and I don't want them to do it. I'm putting this here so hopefully someone can help this person out more than I can.
Please someone help me.,"I can't do this anymore. For months I've been suicidal. Every day it's getting worse. I'm terrified bc I might do it. I'm on the edge. I just don't want to feel depressed anymore. I want the pain to go away. No one in my life will help, they call me overdramatic, pitiful, and too negative whenever I try talking about how I feel. I need someone to help me before I do it. Please. I'm so scared right now "
Add an interesting title to your suicidal thoughts,"Planning on killing myself the 18. Im already on a therapyst and taking antidepresives, but I cant endure all the mess my life is. Been isolated without real friends for more than 7 years. The only person on my family that I cared for, my father, died long ago. 20 years with no studies or ambitions. Recently breaked up with my gf, longdistance relationship. She was the only person on my life making me feel happy and wanting to keep alive. The only thing ive been doing for months now is watch sarcastic memes and playing vydia 24/7 on my room while having breakdowns and selfharming me.The idea of killing me scares me, but living more with this pain n apathy its not worth it. I dont want to continue, i dont find anything worth living for.And...srry for the bad english i guess..."
"Single, no friends, no plans or goals, what's the point?","I didn't go to work today.
I stayed home, distracted myself by cleaning, ultimately ended up on the floor of my living room hitting myself and crying.
My ex came by and dropped off some of my things.
He did some shitty things, but he was the only person I had in my life.
I don't have anyone now. I don't know what to do.
I tried exercising today and as soon as I was done I started crying.
I just don't want to do any of this anymore.
I don't see myself going anywhere or doing anything worth remembering. "
I'm very close to ending it.,"I found out my relationship is a lie, in a lot of ways. Our life has been really hard for the past year or so. We both have been stressed out and mean to each other. He's violent when he's mad-- not towards me though he'll scream at me and break my things and he punches books and walls and our bed while i'm on it. He was once very sweet and reasonable and I think I've just worn him down by being my old depressive self.  Our relationship was the only thing I've felt okay about in my life. It used to give me so much hope and I was going to work hard on myself. But we both have to work a lot and we're still broke and I can't afford to buy a phone even though I've been without one for two weeks. I haven't signed up for classes this semester. He feels closer to his best guy friend and I understand that but I actually thought I was his best friend. I found out that he basically despises me and talks about it with his friend all the time.I really just don't have the energy or the fortitude to try any longer. I've felt empty my whole life and my whole life I've tried to fill myself with hobbbies and goals and other people. I've felt this way as long as i can remember and I tried so hard with this relationship.I just feel like my life will suck no matter what. I'm not good at anything and even the people who love me can't stand me.I've written out a long post to my friends and family. I have my method here with me and I'm pretty sure I'm going to do this. I don't have a working phone and suicide chat hasn't worked the last few times I've tried to use it--- they're always offline.I wanted to be stronger than this but I don't feel strong when I'm just letting a life that I fucking hate happen to me either.Edit- Update:
I actually tried to end it and my method didn't work. I don't have access to quicker methods and I guess that's for the best though I don't really know how to feel. I stepped over that threshold though-- I was there, I was trying to kill myself, and in spite of my best efforts I'm still alive. I no longer feel as desperate to die but I'm still just not happy and it just seems like something I'll try another day when the occasion arises. He stopped me. He was at work and he came home and found me and we both can't stop crying. I'm still feeling pretty hopeless about our relationship but he's been fighting for it. He always decides to step up when I'm done though and I expect him to phase back into his usual patterns and demeanor within 3 or 4 days."
Requesting all counselors,"This isn't even a throwaway account but I have all the typical suicidal thoughts etc. One thing that frequently triggers them are jobs. Getting the same old ""well you aren't going to like everyone you work with"" or ""work is work, its part of the real world"" all that bullshit. I hate it, I don't want to put any effort in to living a pointless life but, I have a skill in wording. CONVINCING CHICKS FOR NUDES HMU. I thought about it and counselors get some decent pay. Not trying to be a dick but counselling isn't that hard. I find giving advice easy and I find talking one on one about a sensitive topic to be easy also. I reckon after a little bit of learning the right wording techniques I'd be pretty damn good at it. Should I pursue it?  I have had my fair share of anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc, perhaps a job as a counselor is a possibility..?"
Lone parent...i feel like I'm drowning.,"I'm not going to kill myself that's certain. But I think about it often. I feel like I'm torn apart inside.I work 6 days a week, I am a lone parent to 2 kids, one has mental health problems and aspergers, I do nothing but obsessively clean and look after everyone, and just feel like.....why can no one ever even ask how I am. I feel lonely and fucked up.Sometimes I just feel like everyone would be better off without me. I live my life with crushing anxiety and low self esteem cos I look like utter shit with horrible teeth. Fat and bald. Meh. I fucking hate how I look.I work all these hours and I'm just treading water. Permanently skint and I don't lead a good life by anyone's standards. Just feel like fuck this life."
My life is basically over,"Hello.  I am not sure who else to turn to so I am on here.  I have been with my soulmate for 4 years now and with her I was able to get this amazing job, but recently I have messed it all up.  Well, during the relationship I have been cause texting other woman and this most recent time was the last straw.  I don't blame her for wanting to leave, but I don't understand why I do it either.  I know in my heart I love her, but it's like I'm two different people.  Anyways, I don't think she is going to stay with me anymore and on top of that I am probably going to lose my job and all my friends/family.  I don't want to move on to anything else.  In my mind there is nothing after her and I can't even bare the thought of not being with her for even a second.  I will find out soon if she will ultimately leave me, which means I will find out soon if I am going to commit suicide.  I don't know what else to do or anything and I'm lost.  But I know in my heart suicide is the only way out.  Thank you for reading."
Almost a year since my last attempt,And now I feel that way again. I dont want to tell anyone because that hospital stay was the worst thing to ever happen to me. I'll lose my job if I get hospitalized again. Or even if I'm no longer stable. The job Ive wanted since I was 8. I was fine then it all came crashing down. It just doesnt feel worth fighting anymore.
Cheated on my gf. I want to kill myself,"I [m\28] cheated on my gf [f\27]. She caught me sexting. It was a one time slip up for me, and i hate myself for it. I feel like I am selfish, to the point all I care about is me and no one else. She didn�۪t deserve this. All I have been able to think about the last 3 days is how I can kill myself."
Why can't I just kill myself?,I wrap a noose around my bed post and slide down my bed. My vision gets blurry and I feel numb all over but I don't have the courage to fully succumb to the pain and go unconscious. Would this count as a suicide attempt or me just being a wuss?
What do i hold on for?,there is still hope
"Doctor here, can anyone in Europe hell this person",This is a post I responded to in askdocs. He sent me a very concerning PM.
Is it worth ending it all?,"I just cant seem to let go of the past..I've had suicidal tendencies since I was 12 years old and while they came and went,nothing has really changed the way they affect me.I was 12 years old at the time and the factors which really affected me were bullying and poor academic performance in school.I was also bullied by my older brother,which didn't help that I was obese and insecure at the time.Over the years,I began to realize I have very high functioning depression.It seems like some days things are ok,and I can do on,and other feel like I was want to put pistol to my head and just end it all.I haven't seen a therapist about any of this,which is something I likely should do,but I digress.In my teen years,I went through some pretty traumatic events which caused me to be almost kidnapped and basically fearing for my life and living alone.This eventually led to my family being forced to flee our home country and move to another one.This event is honestly what made a  previously bad mental health situation for me far worse.When I arrived,I had never felt more alone in my life.I was quite literally living alone in a 1br apartment by myself and spent whole months in isolation besides being in community college.Coping with everything was just the hardest thing.I felt like everyday life and just existing was a burden I didnt want to deal with.Eventually,I managed to pull through,but thats not without attempting suicide twice.Once was by swallowing a whole bottle of sleeping pills,which I ended up throwing up.The second attempt is one which is not only sadly ironic,as it is unsuccessful.It was my 21st birthday and I was going to go for dinner with my brother and his gf.I didn't have a gf,nor any friends,so it was just them two.I was in my room getting ready,putting my shirt on,then my jeans.I reached for my belt and just out of no where the room just felt dark,not literally,but It felt cold all of a sudden.Just very cold,quiet and dark.My breath became very shallow as I looked over my closet which had a clothes rack on it.It just felt like I had to do it.In that moment,I just felt a world  of emptiness,fear and sadness come upon me in an instant and I the only way to deal with it was to hang myself.So I got my belt,put it around my neck and tied it as tight as i could.I got on my knees in the closet,tied the other end to the rack and proceeded to push myself forward and put all the weight on my neck.I did that for 2 minutes or so and began coughing and choking.I couldn't do it.I untied the belt,put it on my waist and haven't attempted since.I don't know wtf is wrong with me.That night I had a good dinner,but deep down inside I was just rotting.It's been three years since I attempted.I tried to take of myself.I went back to my home country,which I left five years ago and I felt crushed.I went back to my old house(which was sold and couldnt go in) where all these events happened and after speaking to new homeowner,i tried to go in just to see what it was like,to relive what was a relatively happy time in my life to what it is now and the guy said no.I was so crushed.Everything I had known,all my friends,my experiences,my home,my whole life was gone due to the fucked up circumstances that led to me leaving.I went back two months ago and came back to the US a month ago and it hurts me every single day.I have the chance to move back,but there's little opportunity there for me.I really don't know where to go from here.I've thought about just going for the third attempt.I'm afraid i'll be successful this time around.My plan is to hang myself again,but this time,tape my hands behind my back.I don't know if I can go in with this kind of pain anymore.Tl:Dr -Was forced to leave home country,spent months in isolation,attempted suicide twice and going for the third attempt."
Destiny,"I started college one week after my 16th birthday. I got a huge academic scholarship to go to a nice private university and everyone was so proud of me. I got used to everyone boosting my ego and calling me a ""genius"". Everything started going downhill when I started dabbling in the drugs, drinking, and partying. I was such a smart kid but the pressure to keep being the person when I started struggling a lot in school because I wanted to be friends with all the wrong people through my newfound freedom in college. I never really found that balance in college between friends and academics. It was either one or the other. When I was 18, I racked up thousands in credit card debit that I can never escape but it was okay because I kept up that facade of a care free lifestyle. Growing up dirt poor and abused for all of my life until I left for college, this was the life I thought I deserved for all of my handwork. Wrong. I should've kept trying harder but my parents never taught me how to be a ""good"" person. I can't blame them entirely though because I know now what is right and what is wrong but I choose the wrong path every time. At 19, I didn't do so well on my grad school entrance exam so I had to retake and take a year off. Well this wasn't really an option for me because I would always take massive student loans out to be able to live in nice apartments and not have to actually have a job. I didn't think I could get a job with my major either... this was where things really fell apart. My parents pressured me into staying in school for another year and take out those loans because they made me believe I wouldn't last in the real world without financial aid.. turns out they were stealing money from me for 4 years through my financial aid account and were trying to keep the cash flow going. During this year, I was so ashamed to tell my friends that I hadn't gotten a degree so I lied. I lied to everyone all the time that I got my degree. Then the lies got bigger because that wasn't enough to appear normal. I became a babysitter while taking online classes (didn't want to run into anyone on campus) but I lied all over social media and in person that I had this kickass lifestyle and job. I feel horrible that I did all of that but I just wanted to be fit in like all of my young professional friends. I couldn't because I had the maturity of a 20 year old.At 20, things started looking up. I got into grad school with a great scholarship! I was so happy. My parents were finally proud of me again. Everything felt great again because I had buckled down and tried so hard to get into the 75th percentile of my entrance exam. Then things started getting bad again. During the summer, I was taking 3 classes that I needed to pass in order to get my degree and start grad school FINALLY. I could've graduated a year ago but I kept going to school for financial aid. This was the worst decision of my life. I had signed my lease already in a different city, had a roommate, borrowed $3,000 for various expenses (thought I was going to be reimbursed with my scholarship), and I event went to orientation. I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did to become so stupid but I failed one of the required classes by .02%. I needed a 60% to pass and I got a 59.8%. I pleaded with the professor and then appealed to the dean. I got a cold, callous response. How could I miss the final exam because I thought it was optional? I had read the syllabus over and over. I had sat in class. Why couldn't I focus and comprehend. What happened to me? Why did the words get jumbled up when I read them and I couldn't understand... this has never happened to me before. The professor and the dean thought I was incompetent. Which I am. I explained everything to them about my situation and what failing the class would mean. My professor told me, ""your destiny is in your hands, not mine"". I fucked up my destiny. I couldn't tell anyone about this, not even the people closest to me in my life because I had already spun everyone this web of lies. Luckily the grad school let me defer for a year because during the year that I spent leaching off of financial aid and after I got into grad school, I started failing my classes because I didn't think they mattered. My gpa dropped by .45. I couldn't get into the school again if I had to reapply.. stupid, right? I made stupid decisions and I became stupid.Where am I today? Well it's supposed to be my first month of grad school in a new city surrounded by passion for the field I love and intelligent, wonderful people. But instead, I am sharing a one bedroom apartment with my older brother who supports me in every aspect of life. I love and appreciate him so much because he's the one person I can be honest with because I know he'll love me anyways. I can't get a good job because I don't have a degree. I don't really know what I'm going to be doing for this next year but I barely ever leave the apartment or do anything that's not watching tv and getting high. I'm lost.My breaking point of how much everything sucks is that this man harassed and berated me in the parking garage for ""almost hitting him"" while on my way up. He followed me all the way up to my assigned parking spot, waited for me to get out of the car with my groceries, and started screaming at me when I did. I calmly apologized but he wouldn't stop. I have been so hurt since that happened last week because I already have horrible self-esteem and negative interactions like that just destroy me. He just wouldn't leave me alone and I didn't understand why my kindness didn't fix things...
Yesterday, I got a package and attempted to pick it up from the leasing office. They said I couldn't because it had my brother's name on it. Weird because I know it was mine. My brother came down this morning and they said I couldn't get any mail delivered here because my name wasn't on the lease and further went on to say that I almost hit someone in the parking garage. So they lied to me yesterday. I can't even stand up for myself. My name can't be on the lease because my parents fucked up my renter's history and I have terrible credit. I feel trapped in a one bedroom box. Another reason not to leave my house anymore. I can't do anything right. I can't even live like a hermit right.I don't know how I'm going to finish this year off. I just feel so broken. I used to be this beautiful, successful, witty, and full of life girl. But underneath all of that, is just the person I am today. A leech, a liar, a worthless filler of space. I thought I could change my life and make some difference but I can't escape my destiny. I try to be nice to people and I get walked all over. All my friends are moving on and here I am digging myself into a deeper hole."
Concerned for a friend,"Won't add too many details, as they browse reddit heavily. A friend has always been the type to joke and troll a lot, but lately she has seemed very depressed. Staying home most of the time, seeing no point to ""normal"" living. This person wants the whole world to be at their beck and call, and anything less isn't worth living. It sounds clinically delusional to me, like severely warped expectations. At the same time, we hang out and have a good time from time to time and all seems well, but the way they casually talk about killing themselves (not in a joking way, in a very serious way) obviously has me concerned. I have been reaching out and I am trying to be a very positive voice in her life, and it seems like things are marginally improving over time. I would be worried that reporting my friend to a suicide watch or pushing them into therapy might alienate them from one of their only friends and positive influences (me). So far I feel good about the progress made, but it would be devastating if they went through with a suicide and I didn't do everything possible to prevent it. Would welcome any advice. "
"Lonely, depressed, and suicidal","Hello everyone,Recently, I've been in a state where, for the past couple of weeks now, I've been at a loss of any kind of interaction with my ""friends."" For further context, I found that even with new friends that I've made through school, hospitalization, etc, just don't care about me and I feel as if they pass me off as if I don't exist. Before pushing them away because of this in these past couple of weeks, I would always genuinely wonder how they were doing, so I'd ask, with little to no responses. I just know it goes a long way with me when someone takes time to ask me how I'm doing, so I'd try to communicate with my friends as much as possible, because I love and care about them. But would they say the same back? The thing is, in these past few months, any friend that I've had has left me for something or someone better over different situations, and those that still try and put minimal effort into being relevant in my life rarely ever call or text to say hi, or ask how I'm doing... It hurts, you know? I'm not trying to come off as egotistical, but I've always cared for people in my life, and I always look to let them know I care just by being there for them, whenever. And I guess maybe I'm invisible to them, or not important on their own paths in life, based on how they treat me back.
It's always been me texting, or calling first, despite the immense amounts of anxiety that it gives me.. I'm sorry, I know it doesn't sound like much of a problem, but I haven't always had friends. Just recently in high school, sophomore year (Junior now) was when things started to pick up for me in my social life, things were going great, for awhile actually... and now, like I should've anticipated, everything seems to be against me. People I used to talk to don't bother with me anymore, I can't show my face in school because of rumors spread last school year... and even those friends that stuck after those rumors settled, the ones that I knew wouldn't buy the bullshit, have just seemed to... vanish, I guess? They weren't saying anything to me for days, so I just turned my phone off.. because I was hurting enough already from other things I won't talk about in this. I turned it on to post this however, and there was still... nothing. I don't know what I did to those close friends I still had, I barely know why rumors were started about me, other than that I heard my ex spread them to see me suffer again when I, and they knew that I was moving on and doing better. In short, I don't know why I'm being treated like this. High school is a nasty place. Being a teenager is even worse. My depression and anxiety have seemed to skyrocket from years ago, and only keep affecting me more and more everyday, and I just don't know how much more of it I can take. I've already been hospitalized because of a suicide attempt several months ago over being trapped in my own thought, and because of those rumors that ultimately led to a bad rep, harassment, and bullying. To note, I'm still harassed by people connected with my ex, which I also guess goes as cyberbullying as well; another reason why I keep my phone off. I just wish those people knew the truth. I wish they could've heard me crying for days and nights on end because of how one false rumor led to... a lot. Truly, a lot. That I, my family, friends that stuck with me, and god, even my ex probably subtly knew I didn't deserve. Anyway. Being in that mental hospital for a week put a lot of strain on my family, and honestly, being lonely like this everyday sure as hell doesn't benefit them, as it only makes my depression so much worse to be isolated like this. My point is, the thoughts of thinking that life is meaningless are returning because my experiences in life have only proven that this happens time and time again... Never has a single person in my life just... seemed to have cared, like, legitimately. As in, sure, I've had nurses that have taken care of me, therapists that listen to me, and other forms of support, but there's one thing in common with them all, and it's that they likely know they're being paid to care about me. Saying that sounds fucked, but I do know they're good-hearted people... it's just, paying people to hear me out doesn't seem too right in my mind. I think it's more right that we should be able to share our emotions, our problems, and just pay ourselves in the way of knowing that we simply helped someone. I'd say the only person that cares, deep down, is my Mom, but I've stopped telling her about my problems because I feel as if it'd be easier for her if I stopped, and just died, after all the emotional stress I've especially put on her, and the rest of my family. I'm in the process of writing and rewriting notes for when I decide to leave. It's only a matter of time before something new pushes me over the edge, or when that thought telling me that life will always be like this wins. And it'd truly be for good this time, I promise myself that. Maybe I should set a date, and if things aren't better by then... yeah.I'm sorry if this was long. I needed a place to put my mind onto paper, where people would see it and hopefully understand me, for once in a long, long time. I've never sent or posted anything this long, so I may regret and delete it, but the thought will still remain from the paragraph before this one. Back to binging Netflix. I should also note that my Mom thinks I'm slowly becoming anorexic based on how little she thinks I eat everyday, and the weight loss she's noticed. I don't know if this is the right place to post about that, but regardless, I've come to realize after a bit she may be right... We all struggle with something, so from my heart, I hope the best and most peaceful moments for everyone here... Feel free to reply, I'd really appreciate it...
goodnight "
My GF's friend in USA is struggling. What can that friend do in order to receive support she needs?,"Someone reccomended me to post this over here:A bit of background: My (17y/o) GF met a (15y/o) girl from South Carolina online. Lets call her E. Overtime, E trusted my SO with the struggles she's going through - Anxiety, depression, abusive, unsupportive mom that only yells at her when she notices that E is feeling sad. Her mom and dad are divorced, mom takes care of her for the most time, dad every other weekend. Out of the whole family she semi-trusts only her dad, or his girlfriend. E mentioned to my SO that she wants to go to hospital for her own safety and suicidical thoughts, but cannot ask her mom about that.I am writing this because apperently she swallowed an entire bottle of pills this morning, so things are getting serious, me and my SO want to help E. What would be the best way to do so? Are there any useful phone numbers besides suicide prevention ones that would guide E? She's too anxious to contact counselor for now.Thank you in advance!Edit: I want to clarify that at this current moment E is not in emergency state, but still needs support and help. I'd really appreciate any phone numbers that are for non-emergency cases"
Goodbye. My date of death 12th of september 2017,"I'm about to end my life. Whoever reads this, you are one of the last people to witness what I say. It's my last words.I'm 18, I've learnt that life is survival of the fittest. I'm the opposite, ugly, fat, my grades are dogshit and no friends. Everyone says ""that exam was easy"" but I get UNGRADABLE they are that bad. I fail at everything I do and also I'm so stupid, seriously something is wrong with me...Try to enjoy what you have and be grateful it's better than mine.Kind Regards & Goodbye,
Adam."
I feel like I can't breathe,"I was hospitalized twice over the past two months for my mental health issues, I thought I was improving but these past few weeks have been shit and tonight I've just been spontaneously crying and having frequent panic attacks. I don't want to end it but at the same time I feel I must for being the sort of person I am - a worthless, ugly, female of all things with no talents of any kind and nothing inherently decent to offer.I don't know how much more of this I can take. I want to scream or just lie down forever."
I'm still alive,"My lack of knowledge where the heart is made me miss the fatal blow by few inches away. Why didn't they just let me die. I'm sick and tired of people saying i got my life ahead of me and i'm still young and i shouldn't kill myself and i'm just overeacting to a heart break. Well this heart break had just killed me in the inside whats wrong to be completely dead i've got nothing left inside me now. Love is a very Funny because the thing is no matter how hard i tell her that she meant alot to me, how much i tell her i love her, how i would sacrifice everything just to be with her and yet she just look away from it like my feelings doesnt mean anything to her. Its so hard to confess that you love someone that you adore everything about them but its so easy to say no to shot you down just because you missed out certain thing that they want. The feeling of dying seems alot comforting than to live one of more second of my pathetic life. "
I'm not me anymore.,"Sorry if this is all over the place.Been depressed for as long as I can remember. Always try to smile on the outside but inside I'm dead. Anxiety, social anxiety, depression and I think I'm bi-polar. 21 and haven't got a job yet. Nobody to stand by me, nobody to tell me it's ok (not like I'd believe them anyways). Were basically homeless right now so I can't just leave my mom and sister like that. Once we get our place though, I think it'll be my time. Been cutting my wrists to see if it would hurt. It didn't. Carved FUCK into my leg, didn't feel a thing. Weed is my fucking lifeline right now but whenever I run out, in comes the depressed state where I just want to sleep all day. Wish I would just get shot or stabbed already. I no longer fear the razor though so, that's probably gonna be my way out. Don't know exactly when or where but I know it's gonna happen. Can't think straight anymore. Fuck life. "
Everyday of my life,Everyday I wake up I think of suicide even though i don't want to die I don't want to live if it means that this is to be my life always alone always searching always fighting always living everyday of my life so empty
i'm done,"im in class about to have a mental breakdown. i'm sick of failing at committing suicide , i have so many attempts i just wish it would work. what's a quick way of achieving suicide  when i get home i'm gonna do it . mom if you're not off work in time i love you "
I have no motivation and want to die,"I can't get myself motivated to do anything anymore. I want to succeed in life and go to a good university but I can never make the effort needed to get it done. Very rarely I get glimpses of motivation but as soon as something isn't the way I thought it would be I plummet and lose all hope for my future and my life.  Every day I think about how I want to die and ways of doing it and when I should do it. I think the only thing stopping me from doing it is how it would affect my family but lately I can't help myself from thinking about how they might not care. I usually can convince myself they will but lately it had been getting harder.I can't maintain a normal sleep schedule anymore, now I just sleep till 5pm and am awake till 8am. I've tried to talk to family or even councilors about what is happening but I've lost trust in telling my family these things and the last councilor started to ignore our calls to book appointments.  Whenever I do try to tell people how I feel I can't fully tell them the truth and end up lying to them so they don't have to worry.I hate everything about myself, I hate my hobbies I hate how I am a failure and I hate how I put on a mask to keep my friends and family from worrying. More and more lately I just don't see the point of living and I'm struggling keeping my emotions in check. One minute I'll be ""happy"" sitting there watching a show and the next minute I'll be super sad thinking about how I want to die or super angry wanting to break something.I don't know why I posted this on here maybe it's a last ditch effort to see if anyone bothers to reply or say something that might help. I fear that one day something will happen with a close family member or friend that will be the breaking point and I won't be able to convince myself not to end my life. "
"I'm shaking, I feel so alone, nothing matters","Number 8, that's the number I got in line for the suicide hotline. To even think that 7 other people are in front of me makes it all feel so utterly pointless.I'm at work, everyone just carrying on - was thinking about hanging myself. I work from home so it's not like anyone would notice until the wife got home.Told her I really need a therapy visit but the earliest availability for the therapist is the same time she gets off at work. Asked if she could ask off early. She says no. She understands why I want her to.Her job makes her happy, unlike mine which makes me want to kill myself. I'm trapped, in my house, on computers that I barely understand to do things I'm just barely capable or incapable of doing. Always hanging on by a thread. 24/7.Today feels like a good day to do it. I can't leave my job without being marked a failure, lots of people depend on me as the sole person working on a big project for my company. I can't bear to quit on the spot and be blacklisted from the only job I've ever really held down in my main career field.I'm the bread-winner but my wife wants her job to be more important since it helps her escape me and my depression/anxiety. The world is going to end soon anyways whether it's a super volcano or another world war. At least I lived through some good times.At this point I don't even work, I just stare blankly at my screen, waiting for my time to roll around. Hoping I'll just die to a heart attack from my anxiety so at least I can say I worked myself to death but even that would be a lie. I do nothing, all day every day. Being dead would be better than being a leech on some honest and good company that other people depend on for their livelyhood.My wife doesn't care about how I feel and she knows that I know. She's put herself first, and I get it, I'd do the same. It just feels so horrendously awful that I just want the pain to go away."
Every night I dream of different ways to kill myself.,"I've been watching the show Hannibal recently which I think has sparked some pretty wild dreams... I always have very vivid and realistic dreams but lately they have been about me committing suicide.. And they are very gorey. (Spelling?)I just want it to end.I lost my job in June and have been fucked since. I could ask my family to borrow money but they've already helped so much without me asking that I feel so guilty asking for even $20. I applied to drive for Lyft and all I have to do is the inspection. But my car is out of gas so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.
What's really been stressing me out is right after I lost my job I got a ticket for marijuana possession in my car. I had a valid doctors recommendation but since I had a bowl packed in my front seat, they gave me a ticket. The reason I was pulled over was for expired registration which I've paid since. I went onto the court website and it told me I qualified to pay the ""fix-it"" portion for the registration. Which I believe is $35. My bank accounts are both overdrawn and I maybe have $0.80 in coins. But otherwise, the ticket said around $1,400. It allowed me to postpone the court date by a month which will now be in a few days. I really don't know what to do and can't really ask my family about it because they don't condone smoking weed.
I know I need to get my original ticket siged to prove my registration is now valid but I still have no way of paying either the fix it portion or the illegal possession portion of the ticket.The only thing keeping me from quitting is my cat. He is my everything. He doesn't get along with anyone but me so I know he would be the most devastated if I left him. I really don't want to leave him but I feel as though there isn't another choice.
I rescued another kitten from the streets that my best friend found. I opened a care credit card to pay for his vet visits. They have been calling every day for the past 2 months asking for payment which I don't have. I put him up for adoption on craigslist because he fights with my other cat constantly which pisses me off to no end. I was looking forward to a few bucks from it to get me started on Lyft so I can maybe start paying things back. But my brothers girlfriend found out and wants to take him for her mom. I feel terrible asking her for money for him so I didn't. She said she will pick him up Friday night. But I really need the money. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel. I just feel hopeless and that is it."
if my family goes homeless....,sorry for posting again but i just had this though and if my family goes homeless which is a case of 35% happening i am just gonna say fuck it i am out because you cant comeback from a situation like this here in greece
Not sure if I'm in the right place.....,"Things came to a head tonight....I have been fighting with my wife, and my mother is dying. (stage 4 lung cancer that has spread to her lymph nodes in neck, and is cutting off her right lung)  Add this with years of depression and you get me staring at the end of a shot gun.  I was debating getting on something but i was trying chantix to quit smoking.  I am now not a quitter so I was just wondering how has anti depressants treated you??  Also I will be getting on something, cause i literally have to.(it was more of just a straight up break down than a recurring issue, but still I am aware enough to know this is SERIOUS AF)"
This is not a scream for attention just read my story and tell me what to do,"Hi reddit.
I am writing this post because i feel realy bad the last months and its not getting any better. I am 16 years old and i go to school from monday till friday. Every time i come home from school i get overwhelmed by the feeling that i am completly alone . There is no one i can tell this story to and that they wont think am crazy. That is why I post this on reddit. Sorry if this is going to be with a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes. English isnt my first languageWHERE IT STARTEDIt all started half a year ago when i realised that a was in a friend group where they treated me like shit and they invited me bc i had money. I made the deccision to not hang out with them and hang out with other friends. But all those other friends where just school friends so after school i always am and feel alone. My relationship with my dad has its ups and downs. My dad is an alcoholic that get realy agressive when he gets drunk and that is very often. This leads most of the times to him hitting me. And that happens pretty often. The Friends I used to hang out with
Started hating on me @ school. When they saw an ugly girl they came to me and sais they founded my girlfriend, every i walk thru the halways the all started shouting my names. First of all I thought it was just something silly and that it would pass away if I ignored it. But it got worse. The started coming to my house at night and somtimes piss in my front yard. They started intimidating me so i would give them money and kicked me to the ground several timesWHAT NEXTOne time I was feeling so bad about this that i told my best friend. I thought he would understand but instead he called me a pussy. I think he did that because he is also a little friends with those guys and he is afraid to back me up. WHAT HAPPEND YESTERDAYSo after my best friend also left me i thought it was my only option to kill myself. So when my parents where away i grapped a rope and tighted it around my neck and to a wooden plank that is right under the ceiling of my room. I jumped of my chair and when i almost passed away the wooden plank broke and i fell down. I started to panic and i threw the rope away. I told my father i broke the plank because i was just playing around and wasnt paying attenion. And what am asking is what to do. Beacause i am not going to attempt to kill myself again but the life am living right now is making me feel worse every single day. And I know a lot of you have a worse life but I dont feel safe nowhere. Not at home not on school I dont have friends to go to anymore. So how can I get out of this situation?"
pills pills pills,"in the process of my third od this month
this time it's going to work, my stomach is already severely fucked.a friend attempted suicide last night, three others are self harming regularly. my flatmates are mad at me and my psychiatrist is super overbearing.hope everyone else is doing alright"
Thursday the 14th,"I've been planning my suicide for Thursday the 14th for about a month now. It's the day before mock exams take place, I don't even feel an ounce of stress for anything which stops me from ever putting work into anything, I've got no future. I'm too scared to take a single step out of my comfort zone and I am too anxious to ask for help. The past week I've spent the nights in bed wanting to cry so badly but nothing comes, I'm just this void of nothingness, I don't even want to talk to close friends about this because I'll just come across as attention seeking. I'm just going to see how the school day is and most probably end it all finally."
"Im not sure if i can do this for much longer. I really, really don't want to do anything drastic but i just want to get out of this cycle of failure, sadness and self-hate.","I don't like asking for help here, because most of you are coping with much more grave issues. I am a 25-year old Masters student, who was on the brink of suicide last year. The biggest problem in my life has been self-diagnosed ADHD(or maybe im just useless). Even though i am not unintelligent, ADHD has prevented me from achieving anything significant. In my present course, i am doing quite well, but only because im studying all the time to make up for poor quality. And a number of personal disasters have also occurred-my gf died earlier this year after suffering from severe ailments of various kinds. And when i finally got selected for a field trip programme to Germany which i thought would be my big break, the insurance companies fucked my policies up, lengthening my wait for the visa. My study town is also an unpleasant place, simply adding to the morass of unpleasant thoughts going through my mind right now. I don't really know what to do. Part of me even regrets not committing suicide last year, as it is simply not an option anymore. "
Suicide Prevention Week,"More like ""i force everyone to live so i dont feel guilty"" week"
The pills didnt work. Tonight i hang.,So stomach pumping is fun. Tonight i hang.
Well today's the day.,"I've had today picked out for awhile. And I have a mixture of emotions. But I plan on doing it tonight, but I still have to go buy my gun, and I'm so freaking lazy I'm worried I won't be motivated enough to go get it.
The gun place opens so early and closes early so I won't be able to get any sleep if I want to go get it.
It would be easier for me Thursday because I won't have work. I want to just ask to borrow some else's gun but everyone knows why I'd want it.
I'm so sleepy. I just wanted to tell you guys that today was my last day.I'm going to play some Destiny and then go to bed.
It's pretty bad that I actually do have a small amount of will power to live longer but it is 100% only because I want to play some more Destiny."
"Why the fuck was I diagnosed with shizophrenia, when chill-pills did well off the bat?","Now I'm being given a shizo pill after a shizo pill, while all I have is some anxiety and depression. No anti-depressants either. The worst part is that I'm not allowed to NOT use them, else I don't get support money from the gov SUPPOSEDLY. I'm so pissed right now.All I want to do is talk to a psychotherapist for a while, but that's expensive, that's what I need the support money for.And my previous pills, risperidone, made me gain weight and grow a pair of tits. That's right, friends. A PAIR OF FUCKING MAN-TITS THAT FUCKING HURT. And, I just wish those go away somehow.I can't even put into words how terribly angry and bad I feel right now. I'm past my bed-time, and I just can't give any fucks right now, I want to die already. I wish I never existed. I wish this shit never fucking happened to me. I didn't deserve any of this 6 years ago, and I don't deserve it now, and there was no reason for this shit to happen to me."
"Hey SW, my girlfriend yesterday attempted suicide by OD with pills, what do I do and say?","I've been struggling with depression for about three and a half years (I'm sixteen) and my girlfriend is fifteen and has been struggling with depression and other mental illnesses for about five years.Screenshots can be given if absolutely necessary, and please ask questions; I'm an open book and you can ask anything for the purpose of helping me and her.Thanks for reading, and I sincerely hope me and her can get over this together."
I want to ask for help from my family but that will change their view of me permanently and I'm too afraid of fucking everything up but at the same time I can't stop crying,"It feels like they don't love me but I know they do, I'm just in a fucked up mind state right now. I know that if I tell them how I feel they'll be supportive and help me, but if they know it'll change their view and treatment of me permanently. I cried myself to sleep last night and I thought I'd start to feel better today, but the same shit is happening. I wanna die but I won't because I don't have the guts, but it's freaking me out how I'm feeling right now because I'm pretty sure something's wrong with me.Now that I'm actually, genuinely contemplating suicide and the thoughts/feelings aren't leaving I should ask for help, but I'm so afraid of what they'll think of me. I don't want them to view me as pathetic or sick, especially in comparison to my older sister. Saying that I might have depression is going to change everything. But it's been two days straight where I feel this low and it's draining the life out of me. Please, help me out, what do I do and how do I do it"
Am I wrong?,"My now ex boyfriend broke up with me so that he can ""figure life out"". He was the only reason I liked being alive. He was my flame. I had something to look forward to. I had a reason to improve myself. Without him I have no desire to live, no desire to improve myself, I have nothing. I get that it is unfair to him, but I can't help that I can't find any internal motivations to live. I just don't know what to do, and I don't know what will happen if he doesn't come back. "
I wish I could just escape from everything.,"But it's a little difficult to escape from what's in your own head. I wish I could just kill myself. I want to so badly. I think about it all the time. It feels like the only means of escape.Everything in life is just so filled with pain. I seem to be constantly afflicted with some sort of psychological torment or another. Everything hurts in some way. There's just this constant black pit of negative emotion eating at me from the inside. I can't take it. It eats away at my soul. I don't even know who I am anymore, if I ever did. There's just depression and everything that comes along with it.I just want to escape from it. I want it gone. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want everything to be okay for once.It's been so long though. So very, very long. My mental illnesses began when I was around 11 or 12 years old. I'm 25 now. Along the way depression sort of became a part of who I am. Part of my identity.It eats away at my soul, then takes it's place.I hate it.I hate the emotional pain and mental agony. I hate the constant stress and anxiety. I hate the terror and despair. I hate being so useless, so worthless. I hate being unable to live my life due to the sickness that has permeated the very core of my being.I want it all gone. I just want to be okay. It's so hopeless.I've tried so much. No-one can help me, and I can't help myself. I seem to be utterly incapable of it, no matter what I do, or how hard I try. I just can't do it. It feels like my pain has become such an integral part of me that no matter what I or anyone else does I cannot separate from it.I can't escape it.Not unless I kill myself. It's the only option available. The only escape I can have.I wish I could do it. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I can't take it. I'm so weak.I just want to escape."
How to stop my desire of kill myself,"I actually got here looking on Google ""how to convince myself for suicide?"" But I just got a lot of pages trying to convince me to stay  alive. I wish i could just stop my mind and suicidal thoughts by reading the web or just by talking good things to myself but my mind doesnt stop, i Am literally sleeping , no eating got the las 3 days, i should be working in my home based business but cant even step out of bed, last night i put q lot of effort to get myself into the shower because i needed to relax, and stop my stupid mind, but it dos not work, and while i was there i almost went out to grab something to cut my wrist. I tought of my mom so i could and start crying because she doesnt deserve the pain of a death daughter. I stayed under the shower for a couple minutes trying to put myself together. I went to sleep, had lots of bad dreams and this morning the same story. I have no energy, no streght to step out of bed or get me something to eat, i want and i am looking for a way to die. I cant fail if i try because could no live with that shame... does anybody have overcome such a darl phase? I can think of very good reason to stay alive, i actually Love live when i Am not so depressed , but know how to manage my thoughts and i feel scary of my own mind. I do not know for how long i will keep trying to do not listen to the part of me that wants to be death. "
Open apology to no one and everyone.,"This is sort of an apology post...its not directed toward anyone, really, but at the same time its directed toward everyone. I split it into paragraphs so its easier to read.I'm sorry I don't post quality content on social media.
I'm sorry that my posts aren't up to your standards. I'm sorry that I try so god damn hard to please you guys and it still isn't enough. I post 50-60 times a day on all of my social media and get zero comments, yet at the same time I see people with less followers than me get hundreds and hundreds of comments on all of their posts combined.I can't exactly complain about it because every time I do, I get the same excuses over and over again.""Sorry, I was busy""
""Sorry, I have school/work""
""Sorry, I was hanging out with my family""Sorry, sorry, sorry. All I hear is I'm sorry. Everyone says sorry, and yet nobody makes an effort to interact with me.I know I sound like a broken record but its true. I feel like I'm saying the same crap every day of my life. On my old account on Google+, when I was fifteen, i had between 100 and 200 followers (I don't remember the exact amount). I had the exact same amount of follwers then as I do on Google+ now, but back then I was actually popular!Back then I didn't even NEED to tag people in my posts because every post I made would get as much as 30 comments and 10 +1's.My favorite part of using Google+ when I was popular was that I always had ""that one post"" that got hundreds and hundreds of likes and shares but got zero comments.That's not the case here. I have to tag people in every single post I make or else my posts get zero comments, and they barely get three likes.This isn't a cry for attention, by the way, its a simple observation. I posted the same content that I did then, but for some reason I'm ignored NOW.I'm sorry I'm not attractive.
I'm sorry I'm not attractive. I'm sorry I'm not a perfect fucking model, I'm sorry I weigh over two hundred pounds and have more than thirty stretch marks all over my god damn body. It makes me feel sad that I actually am afraid to show a picture of myself anymore.I'll talk to a girl and we'll become the best of friends but then the second I show her what I look like she tells me ""I gotta go""I hear the same lies all the time.
""I gotta go""
""I'll brb""
""I gotta go hang out with my family""
""I need to leave for a bit""They always say that AFTER I show them a pic of me, then they never talk to me again or best of all they block me.They'd rather block me then tell me the truth, that they don't like me, and it sucks.  And when I post a picture of myself on social media I have to filter it or people will make fun of me, call me ugly, call me a ""thirty year old pedophile"" (I'm 18, guys, so stop it!). One time I posted a picture of myself and someone said to me ""you're so ugly that it's bullshit that people actually find you cute and they're lying to you to make you feel better."" Yet aren't you supposed to post a picture of yourself to get a girlfriend online?I'm sorry I'm not up to par with dating etiquitte.
I'm sorry that I've never had a girlfriend before in my life, and I guess that makes me undateable. I'm an 18 year old single virgin who's never even had his first kiss her. Every time I get together with a girl she leaves me in three days and it makes me feel pathetic and inadequate. The women who stay with me longer are the ones who pity me. Women stay with me until they find an excuse to leave me and when they find an excuse they fucking take it. Nobody wants to date me and it makes me feel pathetic. The entire god damn summer I never left my apartment because I felt insecure about seeing people in a relationship. One time I started socializing at my apartment pool. Found a decently attractive women in her thirties, who (surprise) has a boyfriend.I'm sorry I exist.
I'm sorry I was even born into this world. People make it so obvious they don't want to be around me. Unless I initiate conversations, nobody texts me (they do if they want something but never any time else) and I feel alone all the time. I have no friends, and my only two best friends IRL left (one I had to cut out of my life because he was appeasing me and the other moved). I'd kill myself if I were suicidal but im not. I'm just really deeply depressed. Im not a failed abortion. My parents wanted me. But I was a stillborn, and I wish my parents left me dead.I'm sorry for everything..."
Getting it all of my chest,"I�۪m not a good person. I treat the people I care about like shit. I lie constantly. I steal. I�۪m just a generally shitty person.
I�۪m not happy. I doubt I ever will be. I�۪ve felt this way since I was seven. Fucking seven. Over half my life spent hating myself and wishing I was dead. I�۪m probably going to be this way for the rest of my life. I can�۪t do that, that fucking terrifies me.
I�۪ve tried to get better. The medication either makes it worse or doesn�۪t help. Therapy is just arseholes trying to force ideas and issues onto me just so I fit into a neat little box for them. I�۪ve been sent to hospital because they were that worried I was going to kill myself. Nothing helps. At this point I�۪m convinced the only way for me to get better is to find some way to solve my problems by myself. I�۪ve spent the last twelve years trying to get better by myself. But I can�۪t, I�۪m too weak.
My family are incredibly supportive, but I can�۪t rely on them. When they know I�۪m feeling shit they  try to help. But it just makes me feel ten times worse. It tears me apart knowing they�۪re going out of their way to try and help.
I seem to cock up everything I do. I�۪ve dropped out of two colleges and I can�۪t hold down a job/
There�۪s not much going on on the social front either, I�۪ve cut off all of my friends except for one person (I�۪ll get to him soon). I�۪ve tried to make new friends, I picked up new hobbies and got myself out of the house to meet new people. It doesn�۪t work, people seem to like me in the moment, but never want to actually be around me. I�۪ve been told I across as weird and rude, I get that, I can be kinda aggressive at times, but I don�۪t mean to be. I hate that I�۪m like that. I don�۪t want to be like that. I just want people to like me. I was meant to be meeting someone to see about testing me to see if I�۪m on the autism spectrum, but that just didn�۪t materialize. To be honest, as lonely as I am, the thought of being around other people terrifies me.
As for that friend I mentioned, I met him online a few years ago and in that he�۪s became the best friend I�۪ve ever had. I love him like a brother. Honestly, he�۪s the only reason I haven�۪t just hung myself yet, no matter how much I want to do it, I won�۪t because it would fucking devastate him. He has his own problems to deal with, I shouldn�۪t be dumping mine on him.
I just want it to stop hurting. I�۪m sick of feeling this way and I don�۪t know what to do any more. Thanks for reading, Reddit. I needed to get that off my chest."
I want to say goodbye so bad...,....but i just can't do it. Why can't someone just murder me or some freak accident happen?

What if you just don't like living?,"I hate when people say ""All of the things in your life are fixable"" because I don't want to die due to personal problems.I hate when people say ""Well, find a job you love"" because I hate the concept of having to work. There is nothing that I'm passionate about that I want to turn it into a full time job, and even if there was I don't want my passions to turn into yet another means of making money. Maybe if you have a college degree you have more options as to what you're able to achieve, but what about those of us working shit jobs who have no degrees? Not everyone can drop everything in their lives, live in a van, and just travel the world.I hate being human. I hate how people make assumptions about people's appearance and then don't bother to see if what they think is true. I hate how outgoing, narcissistic people get ahead way more than those who are less popular but by no means less qualified. I hate how stupid, vapid, and easily manipulated human beings are. The world is just a popularity competition based on how many people like you. Why should I have to go out of my way to force people to like me? This society was shaped by narcissistic sociopaths for their own benefit. I don't care how my friends or family will react, because emotions are temporary- remember? No emotion lasts forever, and someday- maybe not now or in a few months or years- they'll get over it. Life doesn't stop when one person commits suicide, and it's not like I'll be conscious to regret or miss anything. I'd rather die that go on trying to pretend to be like anyone else. I'll never be that popular, outgoing person that everyone flocks to, it just isn't me. I cant go back to blinding optimism when I've seen so much terrible shit. Life is cruel, heartless, and not worth enduring. I just see suicide as a way to opt out permanently. "
I just want the pain to stop,Two nights ago I prayed that I wouldn't wake up. Every day my mind is crowded with thoughts of my own worthlessness. I just want the pain to stop.
Just found out the love of my life is engaged to someone else. I'm tired of trying to improve the life I chose to ruin. This is ending before the weekend.,dont do it we love you every sigle person in this community this reddit loves you and understands you you have talents just show them to the world
I should just give up and die,I'm such a fuckin idiot I can't even do well on the easiest quiz of the year which was supposed to be a high school review. Why did I even bother trying when I'm never going to be as good as everyone else. So stupid of me to think I could even compete.
People are so mean. Why must I be so sensitive in this world.,"I am so sensitive. I cry easily. I am emotionally affected by everything almost. I hate it. I have anxiety and can't talk to people. I can't handle aggression at all. I don't want to be here. The world feels so cold, cruel, and distant. I feel like a scared deer alone. "
"It's not an if, it's a when","I don't like life, and it certainly doesn't like me. I can be the most fun and outgoing person and after a few weeks at the drop of a hat I'll wake up a different person and I barely leave my bed because the weight of existence is just too heavy for me. I don't have the balls to kill myself right now, but I have come close in the past and I'm 100% sure it'll happen in the future. Even in my manic states the anxiety of knowing that it's only temporary drives me insane. It's like there's 4 different versions of me living in my head and they constantly fight over who I'm gonna be and when no one is winning for some time I'll just be numb. I feel disconnected and I can't remember the last time I was close with any other person. I've never even felt a part of my family. It's not that no one cares, I just have no one to care.I hate my job, people treat me like shit, I don't make enough money, I dropped out of college on an impulse in manic state and I missed out on that window of opportunity. I have no one. I have no direction. I'm fat, I'm not well spoken, I'm not smart, I'm not really good at anything, I have nothing going for me.I realize how all over the place this post is and I really have no train of thought. I'm just venting to a depressing subreddit because I know I want to die eventually and I have no one else to even try to talk to. I don't even care enough to hide behind a throwaway account.The worst part of it all is knowing that no matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, no matter what progress I make, I will never truly be better, and that's what makes me look forward to it someday being over. I know how it ends, I'm just waiting for the credits to roll.I'll never be ok. I feel so alone all the time. I'm looking forward to the inevitable end of this and I just hope that I'll make friends in some sort of after life."
Please tell me it's okay to die,"No throwaway this time.I posted once about 5 years ago on a throwaway when I first had serious suicidal thoughts, but my depression has lasted for 10 years now. This time though I'm just too tired to keep going. I'm not the kind to be happy accomplishing things alone. I figured that a few years after my depression and my first real attempt at suicide, I'm not happy unless I can share it with someone else, but then I found my first love shortly after, for 2 years I was happiest in my life, but then after losing her by being cheated on I lost everything worse off then I was before and attempted suicide multiple times the year after. For 3 years I held on with daily panic attacks and nightmares with the hope that there will be someone else worth it, someone who deserved me and after 3 long, painful, hollow years I found her. I finally had my second chance and for 2 years I was able to see a future and color in my life again. Now I have lost her too to someone else again and my life is in a loop of nightmares.I don't feel anything anymore as my only thought is that this will all end soon, any future now is not one I want to live through with a pain in me again for years and years again like before wishing I was dead. Wishing I had done it sooner. I'm done. I can say I tried.I just want to end it soon, and this time I wont wake up again to my living nightmare, I just need to know it's okay to die, its okay to let go, its okay to sleep and forget about all that hurts. I will always love her, please let me hold on to the last two years of happiness and let me dream them forevermore.  "
I'm ending my life tonight,"Can't take it. I can't draw shit, can't get good grades, can't make any friends, I can't do anything. I'm fucking pathetic, no one will miss me anyways. My dad's too busy getting drunk to even speak to me now. Short and sweet.Peace out Kekistanis ~Mike "
"It seems to be the only way ""forward""",[deleted]
Just a few words before I go and hang myself.,30 years old. Virgin. No friends. No relatives. Shit job. No future. No prospects. The world is better off without me. Goodbye everybody.
All I want is love and affection.,"All I want is affection. I never got it as a kid and now to be frank. None of my friends how that they care, none of them love me back. Ever since 8th grade I've always wanted a girlfriend, not to be cool, but to experience the raw feeling of being loved and to love. As a Senior, nothing hurts more than to be rejected by the one you truly love and care for to reject and tell you you aren't good enough. This friend I cared for, she told me everything, she was a big part of my thoughts. I hate myself for being so mushy and vulnerable, but I can't escape these feelings and the longer life goes, the larger the desires to be cared for are. My life is beginning to spire down and this is one of the reasons why.I am pathetic and disgusting for saying this, but the only thing I want is someone to spend time with, a girlfriend. It really hurts to say that and I'm sorry."
I just really want to end it.,I'm sitting here in the floor. Drank a bottle of wine. Listening to the Legend of Zelda: OoT start screen music. My life is going nowhere. I'm in debt from college loans. I dropped out of college multiple times because of depression. Or maybe laziness most likely. I work at a dollar store making barely anything. I can't even pay my phone bill. I'm living with my friend and his gf and I think they're getting sick of me. I have nothing to contribute to this world. I have a job that'll pay better and stuff that'll ill be switching too soon but I'm probably going to fuck that up somehow like I always do. I joined the Air Force before but got kicked out of boot camp because I had stress fractures. I just can't seem to be good at anything besides menial labor. I just want to kill myself. I've cut some recently even though I'm 21 and haven't done it before. There's so much more I want to say but I'll just leave it at that. I don't feel like I should live anympre because I'm worthless. Completely fucking worthless.
What kind of prep before suicide?,"Not sure if this breaks the ""don't be explicit about methods"" rule...Basically, are people who are going to commit suicide doing anything else besides maybe writing notes? Did you make a will? Close all of your accounts? Pack up or sell things? Maybe even take out a life insurance policy several years in advance?I just think it's already going to be bad for the people who care about me, so I don't want them to have more hassle than necessary."
I think now's my time,"I'm 15. I have contemplated killing myself for about a year and I have kind of hit a point. I have a great family and a good life with everything I need. I just don't see any purpose in life. I wake up every morning and curse and punch my wall because I hate living. My friends ask me why I look so pissed off and I just say it's because I have to come to school. I am pissed off that I am alive. I wish I could just end it all but I don't want to because my mom, dad, and sister would be devastated. My sister is about to enter college and I don't want her to become so sad that she drops out or becomes distracted. I don't want to hurt my parents so bad that they think it's their fault or end up suffering for years. I also don't want to kill myself because I feel it would be a disservice to all those that are less fortunate then me. They might have it so bad but they keep struggling through day to day. I have everything I need but yet I'm still not satisfied. Sometimes I lay in bed and cry because I don't see a purpose in living and I think about all the fucked up shit that happens in our world. The universe is so big and time moves so fast I don't think anyone would even miss me. Why does anything I do even matter in the grand scheme of things. Everything I do, good or bad, will be lost and forgotten. Everything I do has no significance and no meaning. I want to reach out for help but I just can't bring myself to do it. I thought about maybe joining the military and trying to go somewhere dangerous so I could die then at least then at least my parents wouldn't be ashamed of me. But that takes to long. I need a solution now. I have played through the scenario in my head multiple times. I would walk, in the middle of the night, to the freeway overpass and jump off. But I just can't bring myself to do it. Recently my grades have started dropping and my parents are mad at me. This is kind of the breaking point. If there was already no point in living why make myself suffer more."
I'm not okay.,"I'm just tired of people treating me this way but maybe if it's happened this many times I'm the awful one. In fact maybe I shouldn't even ask for help because if I vented my story to anyone they'd be reminded of some similar story of it happening to them and hate me. Sometimes I just wish I hadn't been born a woman so I wouldn't have to deal with this. Sometimes I just want to cut off my tits and fuck myself with a knife or something, then maybe the people I've hurt over the years by being a selfish slut would be a bit happier in their lives. I remember being feeling hope because of this TED talk explaining how the stress response was the body's way of telling us to seek help. I guess that's me, seeking help and feeling the slightest bit relieved even knowing help isn't coming and that no one will ever agree with me or love me again. I'm okay with banging against my coffin for a bit longer, I'm just tired of letting people believe I'm willing to be anything other than what I am, a selfish slut. "
"Who cares if a sleazy porn director wants to kill himself! Fuck my life, this is not what I wanted!","I'm 32 years old and my life is completely fucked up. To sum it up, I'm a porn director living in L.A. All my life, I wanted to be an actual film-maker like John Ford and James Cameron, but life is not what's it's cracked up to be and in order to find work, I had to work in porn. After sending my scripts over to studios like Warner Bros and Fox, I got turned every time and even to do this day, I still get turned down. I've been directing porn for nine years and I'm just tired of it, I didn't want this and now, I'm going to kill myself! I'm sorry baby, I know I was the best thing you ever had, but i'm done, I don't want to be a part of this sleazy industry anymore! I'm done! "
My best friend killed himself and I'm next.,"He wasn't only my friend, he was my ex boyfriend. My first love. My first boyfriend. My first everything. Ever since he died back in May, all I think about is killing myself. Nothing feels real anymore. I've read about something called the ""suicidal trance"" and I believe I'm in it. The only thing stopping me is the fear that what comes after death. And honestly, as messed up as it may sound, missing out on stuff. Josh was one of the strongest people I ever knew so losing him was such a shock and I haven't been able to cope with it. It's been four months and every day I get closer and closer to ending it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
2 for 2,"Moved away from my hometown 3 years ago. Friends basically disowned me, family is either abusive or strangers, nothing left for me there.The only thing keeping me holding on is that I had people that needed me; my wife, and my boss.2 weeks ago, my wife left me.Today I got fired.I'm 31, have an obscure GED, a spotty work history (this is the only job I've had past 3 months), and can't answer interview questions ""correctly"". Especially online, where they reword the question and I understand it differently, so I answer differently. This is due to a learning disability that affects my comprehension and communication skills. On top of that, I have trouble with tone and ask a lot of questions,  so I come across as defiant. I don't have a backup plan, and I'm confident I can't bounce back from this.  Who needs someone with the qualifications of a teenager, but with half the durability?"
I can't stop thinking about it.,"I'll start by saying that I don't think I'm in serious danger of attempting anything very soon, so I understand that there are people on here that need help more pressingly.I came out to my parents as transgender a bit over two years ago. It went horribly, and I overdosed and ended up spending six months between two mental hospitals. Anyway, my parents came around, and I'm back home, and we love each other. I'm out to everyone now, which is great, but I also live in North Carolina, which is less great.I'm called a tranny or a faggot most every day at school; it feels like the entire state���the entire country, even���hates me and all trans people.I have PTSD from being repeatedly raped when I was twelve, and I still get delusions and flashbacks. It gets worse this time of year, as well, because it's the anniversary.I don't want to die. I want to live and have a cool life. There are things I'm passionate about; there are things I want to do; there are people who I love and people who love me. But I can't stop thinking about it. Every time I start feeling okay, it hits me like a wall. What if? I'm terrified. I don't want to die, but I can't get it out of my head."
Please Help Me,I don't want to die but it's all I can think about. I don't see any other way out. I just need the pain to stop.
My friend is going through some tough times...,My friend  is very emotional and is on the breaking point of suicide. Im trying to get as much help as i can to him but Its not enough. I need to help him.

I just want to stop hurting,I'm just so tired of it all. Everything goes wrong and I'm too stupid to prevent it no matter how hard I try. I even screw up when I try to kill myself. I just don't know what to do anymore.
My worth is $40,"All my friends I've ever had fall into one of two categories, they either used for their advantage, they felt bad for me, or both. I wanted to kill myself a few weeks ago and ended up in a psych ward. After I got out the only friend I had left that I thought I could trust asked to hang out, he asked if I could get him some weed I said yes I bought him $40 worth of weed and told him to pay me back when he could. A few weeks later I asked him to pay me back he read my message then and the a few days later he blocked me. I then tried to kill myself when I realized no longer had anyone. I failed and ended up in a psych ward again. My whole I always try to treat the people around as best I can. And every time people treat me with shitiness in return. The problem is with me, which is why i need to kill myself. I can't end up in psych ward again like a failure.Edit: I made this post before I went to bed and just woke up now, holy shit your guys are so incredibly kind. Whenever I feel down again I'm going think about everybody who replied here. Thank you so much everybody my day is off to an amazing start. I don't remember the last time I woke up feeling so loved.Edit 2: If anybody is still reading and wants to help can you redirect your kindness to  I was the only the only person to reply to his post last night and I think he could use some kind words."
Serious Question,"Why is suicide considered selfish? To many its seen as selfish but to the one whom experiences the want for it, its because its an escape from , what they feel as, a life time of sorrow. if this was the case, wouldn't it be selfish for the ones around that individual to want him/her to keep going if it is just going to be miserable? I'm not suicidal right now, for the most part, but this idea crosses my mind a lot. any input anyone?"
My take,Go easy on yourself. You might not be perfect but you're definitely a long way from unlovable or irredeemable. Your lack or fear of intimacy is a self defense mechanism to protect yourself from getting hurt. Chuck your past experiences in the trash bin and enjoy life. Just keep an open mind as a backup plan in case things don't work out so you can go back to normal again
I can't take this anymore. If i dont kill myself ill go insane,"As long as i remember I never grew up with a real family. I was taken from my mom when i was two because she neglected me. Im the bastard of a half blind, fat, bald and bipolar nutcase. I spent my childhood in a grouphome, moving from place to place leaving friends and belonging behind without any warning. I was constantly bullied because i was skinny and sickly from all the fucked up meds they shoved in my mouth to shut me up. I had frequent violent manic outbursts, hurting the other kids who bullied me. I couldnt fucking take all the abuse. I finally was put in a foster home where I spent a year and a half in what seemed to be solitude. I was told i was gonna be adopted by some married couple who also adopted my brother who i never met. I thought i was gonna finally be able to live in peace. My brother is a complete fucking asshole, he constantly provoked me to go on a rampage for his own amusement and would enjoy playing with me as i helplessly tried to hit my 14 year old brother (i was 6). Eventually they couldnt take my shit anymore and sent me off to a foster home again. I went through 3 other failed adoptions, being tormented my others and treated like dogshit. I was no more than a extra set of helping hands and/or a punchingbag. they treated me like i was a item they could take back for a refund whenever they wanted. All of this made me into a introverted socialy inept fuckstick who cant even start a conversation without looking like a complete fool. and worst of all im now 17 years old a senior with no friends. Im a kissless virgin who has almost never talked to a girl in his life. THAT'S the worst part, i just want to fall in love with somebody, i feel like everything i ever wanted or needed in my life was flat out denied to me. I feel like i dont even belong in life. I've attempted once and ended up in the hospital. I feel like my life just isnt worth it. I dont even feel human anymore. Maybe ill finally get the guts to do it again and this time i wont fuck up for once in my life. So long fuckers"
I just need some help; everything in the past year is just a horrible downward spiral.,"Okay, this is probably going to be annoyingly long but I have to get this out to someone. I'm sitting in bed, so upset that I can't even cry. I just got an email that my power bill for the past 30 days is $500. I live in a 3 bed 2 bath apartment in a small Georgia town with my boyfriend and our roommate. I don't know how on Earth we could have possibly used 3000kWh of power in 30 days, we operate AC reasonably, turn lights off, all that. The bill is due in 13 days and I don't have a job. My boyfriend doesn't have a job. I have all the experience I need to get a decent paying professional job. I've applied to over 60 places in the past month and a half and the most communication I've gotten is one single email saying they're going with another candidate.I've had major depressive disorder since I was 14 years old. I have a reasonable control on it, but right now I want nothing more than to just stop existing. I've been living on my own, with my boyfriend for about a year or so, ""unofficially"". He had more than enough money to pay for rent at our old place so he did. I was sort of in between my parents home and his apartment. Now, my name is just as much part of the lease as his. All of my things are at this new apartment and I hate it. Every single time I leave my parent's house I just sit in the driveway and cry. I rushed too quickly to be out of high school and in college with all my freedom. My downward spiral started when I wasn't accepted to my dream school, UGA. I had always said I'd go there, from the time I went to games and tailgated with my uncle and dad as a kid. But even with honors grad, a few AP classes, and a decent GPA and ACT score, I wasn't accepted. I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA and honors. I skipped classes nearly every day, I never did my work, but it never mattered because I always had A's. College was obviously different, but I still skipped because my teachers never really did anything about it. I managed to end the semester with a 3.0 GPA, my only failed class being an annoying College 101 required course. I decided then that I wanted more freedom to work and all that so I applied to Liberty University Online, my parent's alma mater. It severely kicked my ass and I failed both classes on account of not doing any work. Now I'm here... I am trying desperately to start back at a tech school in January and try to transfer into UGA but life just keeps kicking my ass. I can't get a job despite having great experience and references; and I haven't even begun on my relationship.My boyfriend and I met on Tinder in August of 2015. I just went through a horrible breakup with my high school boyfriend of 2.5 years who thought it would be fine to break up with me via email while I was in Scotland on a school exchange trip. My boyfriend, who we'll call John, also went though a breakup a few months prior to mine. We met up and talked and eventually started dating. But he's now an entirely different person than I met. I know I am too, because people change, but he's too different. All he does is play video games all day. I love video games and I even love playing them for hours. But when it becomes the first thing you do when you get out of bed at 4-5pm and don't stop until you go to bed around 5-6am, it's a problem. He's perfectly content to live in filth. He rarely, if ever, picks up after himself. We have sex maybe once a month, sometimes every other month. I know he isn't cheating on me because he's just that lazy. Obviously the logical solution is to just leave him. I've heard it from anyone I've told. But as with all things, it's not that easy. We got a puppy together last year and have already agreed that if we break up, he's in a better position to take care of him. So #1, I lose my dog. He's also horrifically depressed but refuses to go to a doctor or do anything about it, and I know that when I leave him, he's just going to become some shadow of a person and that's not good for the dog or anyone else. I know it's not my responsibility what he does after we break up, but still. All of my things are at this new apartment. I don't even know how I would begin moving everything back to my parent's house. I'm horrifically out of shape and that's mostly due to the fact that my boyfriend is obviously too lazy to cook every day, so he normally just orders food 2x a day. We've somehow spent $40,000 since January and I don't know how. No extravagant purchases, no vacations, just a bunch of small meaningless purchases that add up.TL;DR I don't know what to do. I feel so stuck and my heart hurts. I've fucked up my life, I have no passions, I can't get a job, I can't go to my dream school, my relationship is terrible, I owe $500 I don't have, and I want nothing more than to just stop existing.

Slipped away.,"As i look at the pills in my hand right now, I wonder what I did to deserve being lied to by the person I love. 9-12-17"
I can't handle this anymore,"hello readers. first off, i am sorry. i am only posting here because i have nowhere else. i cannot stand myself any longer. i keep failing at everything i touch. my job, my relationships, money. i am nothing and the people i care about the most right now have turned their backs on me. tonight could be the night and i am sorry everyone.

What makes people fight to live through extreme medical conditions like cancer or paralyzation?,"I don't even have a major condition; just some whiplash that seems to be lingering without getting better for a solid week. Before, it was six spinal fractures. I'm not out of my 20's yet and probably have a worse back than old men.I know I tend to catastrophise, but what's the point of not being able to do things, to have nothing to look forward to except the chance the next doctor's appointment will bring some relief? When usually it doesn't."
Help! Will my friend die from taking 4000mg of fluoxetine?,Hate to say this but SSRI antidepressants are one of the worst ways to go. Very painful. Why are you feeling this way tonight?
It will happen eventually...,Does anyone else feel like in the end you're gonna die from suicide? Like no matter what you do that's gonna be the end result. I'm 23 and I feel like even if I make it to 50 I'm still going to end my own life.
Sparing everyone,"I don't see the point of going on. I've always been this way, depressed, anorexic, abused. I am average at everything. Average looks, average grades, not talented or good at anything. No one has ever been in love with me, they just take and use and never give and there is a comfort in having a body pressed against mine but afterwards I'm just lonely. My parents will be relieved, I know. My mom will be happy, my dad doesn't deserve to be stuck with a daughter such as me. Therapy isn't available to me for a myriad of reasons, so please don't mention. I just don't see the point. Everyday will be the same, me on the computer or crying in bed, daydreaming about things that will never happen. If I do get out, it's with ""friends""(read: people I drink and smoke weed with but have no connection whatsoever) and it's pointless, most of the time I don't even remember it.The world is not going to miss me, it's not like I'm going to cure cancer or even I have a family and have people that love me. I am just done for it to get better because it doesn't. I plan to do it on October 1st. "
"Almost two weeks left for my death, here is what is down.","I decided that this month would be the happiest month of my life, it was not possible till a few days back, but now Im really pretending to be happy. Let me tell you it makes some people feel fucking insecure. Its very hard for me to pretend but I will crack jokes, laugh and take pictures with everyone till Sept 24. On 25, theyll find me dead in a white dress.I wrote letters to my family. I made little care packages and ""Open when"" notes. One for each day for a month immediately post my death. One for the next ten birthdays, anniversaries. For my birthdays, when they'll remember me. When they will miss me. For my sister's wedding.I am almost done with the crochet blanket Im making for my parents.I have fought with my parents and stopped talking to them. This gives them time to get used to not having me around.Cut myself a few times, hopefully scars don't remain on the big day.  I want to look good. That's it. Still there are a lot of items pending.. but Two weeks left. Still time to finish."
Hopeless.,"I posted here a little while ago, but here is the outline of my story. The last 3 and a half years have been hell. My head hurts, my face feels congested and blocked, my ears crackle, pop, block and hurt with every swallow. Loud noises make my eardrums rattle like a blown out speaker. After seeing herbalists, ENTs, nutritionists, allergists, osteopaths, doctors and dieticians I was no closer to finding out why I had these symptoms. I was becoming a nervous wreck as I cut out dairy, sugar, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and basically every pleasurable food except for fruit. I was given every anti allergy and sinus drug, spray, tool and device you could think of. Nothing was helping it. I was stuck in bed, feeling more depressed with my constant head cold like symptoms, feeling lethargic, sad and desperate.                                                                                                          My anxiety was becoming horrendous, I was developing OCD because of the fear of touching/smelling/inhaling everything in case that was why I was having these symptoms. My doctor told me I could be like it for life and I may never get better. We finally found an ENT who took me seriously 18 months later. He scanned my sinuses and ears and said they are perfectly clear and diagnosed a jaw issue. Finally, I had a reasoning, a medical reason for feeling like I did. TMJ. I matched every symptom perfectly and there was hope. We found a dentist who specialised and he ordered a scan which showed significant damage to the TM joints and degeneration. A heavy programme of physio, rehabilitation, splint therapy and soft food followed as I finally got out of my lower, hopeless moods and anxieties and found a path to normality. The pain got worse and worse as I underwent treatment, and I went on painkillers daily. I was miserable, but hopeful. He retired last Christmas and I saw a colleague who referred me to the surgeon they use. He said the issue hadn't resolved at all non invasively and now it was time for surgery. I'm in the UK and the waiting lists over here for the NHS are exterminate, so we had to self fund. Lying in bed the night before, I knew I would either get my life back, or it would fail and I would feel worse than ever. The operation came, went and 4 months later I've not seen any improvement, and have now developed severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms after collapsing 2 days after the surgery. The nurses put it down to taking off the bandages and the heavy cocktail of drugs I was on, but it was terrifying. My head felt pressured, things felt surreal and it shook me. I now keep having panic attacks ever since. My anxiety daily is 100/100. I'm severely depressed, in pain, things feel surreal and I'm forgetful. I'm seeing a therapist who is trying to help me manage my pain and, although she is so lovely and helpful, it just is so tough talking about it. I'm empty, broken, hopeless and sad. I'm waiting for the next anxiety attack, living through the days terrified of my anxiety, avoiding everything because I'm now not 100% sure what is causing the symptoms, and waiting to go back to sleep. Things are a blur, and my therapist said I am severely anxious and depressed and struggling to find positivity as well as having flashbacks. Nothing is getting better and I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you to whoever reads this. "
Interesting?,"I've never blogged before or been on a forum but it's become to much. I've tried many times, clearly unsuccessfully. I've even went as far as charcoal burning for the carbon poison but couldn't stand the smoke even though I took a shitload of Alprazolam to go to sleep. So I've done a lot of research on lidocaine and intravenous. I've managed to take my own blood and although I know the heart attack isn't the most Pleasant way to go it isn't the worst way to go. Then I'll probably slip into a coma beforehand anyway. I've done extensive research and I've obtained enough lidocaine to make it happen. Ironically I went to the ER the other day, Illinois Masonic and the intake nurse violently probed me to get blood; she failed I laughed to myself thinking I did a much better job."
"I'm going to kill myself, you don't have to.","I�۪m posting this here, because I have no one to talk to. That is by design. I have avoidant personality disorder and my version of it is very effective and efficient. I don�۪t know anyone; I isolate myself because I�۪m ashamed I exist. I was an abused and neglected child, I never received treatment when it might have helped, the person that abused me hid it very well and the other adults in my small family were incompetent and inactive.I started fantasizing about suicide when I was 10; this was triggered by circumstance, not biology. I didn�۪t tell anyone, because it would have resulted in violence and mockery. I have always been desperate for life to end.I tried to kill myself as a teenager, but it was a weak effort and I spent a few months in a locked psychiatric ward. After I got out I went to school for a while, then I just stayed home. I lived as a shut-in for over a decade, spanning my adolescence and early adulthood. It was allowed, I was sick, but no one intervened.I tried to kill myself again, this time violently, again failure. Only a month in a psych ward this time. When I got out, I got my GED, and a job. I tried to pursue normalcy for a few years, but failed. I have never felt comfortable around other people. My brain malfunctions, it feels wrong to be looked at, it feels wrong to communicate. I�۪m ashamed and embarrassed that I exist.I was left alone with my mother as a child. She was mentally ill, emotionally disturbed, overwhelmed, and unmedicated. She wanted to pretend she was alone. She would beat me, belittle me, and torture me in the hopes of keeping me quiet. I can still see the rage and hatred in her eyes, the disdain and contempt in her voice.She won. I�۪ve spent my entire life trying to pretend I�۪m not here. I wanted to love, to be affectionate, to be outgoing. But I don�۪t want to bother anyone. I don�۪t deserve anything.I�۪m not dangerous; I�۪ve never hurt anyone and have no desire to. That�۪s the worst part, I�۪m weird and I know people identify me as weird. When you're a man and people identify you as weird, they fear you. I understand, its best to err on the side of caution, but people being afraid of me or thinking I�۪m potentially dangerous breaks my heart.I�۪m going to kill myself. The way I see it, I have 2 choices, isolation or death. I can no longer maintain isolation; I�۪m out of resources, so death it is.To make sure it gets done this time, I have 2 options. If the first is too hard, the second only requires a moment of bravery. It�۪s violent, but guaranteed. Neither option has the potential to harm anyone else.I�۪m not here for sympathy, just to be heard for a moment. And to let the younger people here know that the sooner you get help, the better your chances of recovery. If you can ask for help, do so. I don�۪t have it in me, but I wish I did.Just remember, there is no cure for mental illness, but there are people that can teach you tools and skills that will help you manage it and gain control.I�۪m going to die because I see no other choice, if you do see choices, please, make the choice that allows for a better and longer life.I love you.Thank you for reading.TL;DR: I�۪ll be dead soon, do better than me. Taker easy."
I wouldn't be doing this for myself.,"Recently I've been falling back into a depression again. I've been clinically diagnosed with depression for about two years now and as you may know it doesn't really ever go away, it just sort of subsides.
I think this is due to all the returning stress in my life. With the returning school year I'm once again going to high school. My high school is a special high school in a sense that it's especially bad. Other schools threaten their students with the prospect of going there, and it's not even an alternative school. We consistently are beaten by all the other schools in every academic area and the majority of our teachers have stopped caring. This sense of apathy has spread to lots of the ""intelligent"" students (causing a chicken in the egg conundrum).With my return to my school people have started questioning me about what I want to do with my life. Typically I just shrug and say I don't know, but truthfully, I really like art. It is my dream to write and/or animate a television show but sadly where I live the only job prospects are meth manufacturer and meth dealer. This brings me to another problem, money. My family is pretty poor. I live in a one parent home with two siblings, one of which is very sick and may very likely die soon. My father has also told me that his doctor had told him that he won't live past 60. He is in his mid fifties.Thankfully however, my family has saved enough for college. Sadly, we can only afford a bachelor's degree for both my surviving sibling and I.My plan is to kill myself sometime soon, or at least before graduation so that my brother will have enough for a master's degree and then some. I genuinely don't see the bad side to this. I may even be able to make it seem like an accident so that he doesn't have to deal with the grief of having a brother for a suicide case (if I can't make it an accident I definitely won't bring this whole scheme up in the note, that's just poor manners).In a sense, I'd really be killing two birds with one stone here. I'd be giving my brother a better life, one that he deserves, and I'd be able to die happily knowing that he got out of this shitty situation. "
Is it too late to excel at 24?,"I know this question probably gets asked a lot, but I also see many misleading answers to this question. Most of the time, the answer is ""no, look at person X, he didn't start the thing he good really good at till he was 30!"" or ""no, most nobel prize winners make their huge discoveries around 40"". But what is wrong with these arguments is, that these people didn't really dwell in depression till that age. They built the foundation for their success till then, or learning other things and how to learn things or at least not getting brain damage I was shit at uni, due to laziness and depression and social anxiety. I really think, now I am doomed to live the like of a dumb person, and that I wasted my potential forever. That I cannot be great at socializing anymore, just less shit. And this thought really makes me want to kill myself. "
I think I'm about to die.,"I'm 16, young, and naive. This all just feels so empty, typing this now. Please, don't perceive this as a cry for attention, I just need a little advice.
I used to care about school, up until about halfway through last year. I got concussed, can't play hockey anymore, my grades fell to shit. Now I go to school high, fuck off in class, and just don't care. All the girls I meet are likely scared away by my distant and cold behaviour, and the ones that aren't just want some stoner boyfriend. Nobody chooses to love me, and I've only just realized this. My parents hardly talk to me, just because I'm not religious and they found that out. They support my criminal of an older brother more than they give a shit about me. My friends are fake, they hardly talk to me and I know they wouldn't talk to me once highschool is over. If I make it. Anyways, I think I'm going to die. I keep finding myself in these absolutely fucking crazy situations. I climbed a train bridge to take a picture of my shitty city, in the dark, cold night. I've been on countless police chases (I like to ride an unregistered motorcycle, I love running from the cops) even while high. Climbing into abandoned buildings, I even went into an abandoned military base with armed guards a few weeks back. Just stupid shit like that, and I'm not afraid of dying. Speeding through the city at 4am at twice the legal speed limit. I just don't really care anymore, nothings keeping me here.
How can I make myself care again?? Feeling empty isn't the greatest thing, especially when it draws you to death. "
"No one to talk to. If there was one, i would be too anxious and get a panic attack.","I cant even see therapists anymore. My anxiety and depressions got so bad i cant talk to anyone anymore. Also i ruined my last friendship just now so i cancelled every therapist appointment i would have gone to just for my friend. All motivation is gone and the suicide thoughts never were so damn real. Im just so hopeless. Crying all day in my dark appartment. No friends, family or job. Also my savings will be gone very soon and i end up on the streets. Its sad that death seems like the only logical option to me. I am so lonely it has become physical pain. I dont know what to do, i have no one."
Can I have someone to talk to?,"I always feel so alone, timid, afraid. I've never been good at making friends, being social and don't speak with my family. I have mental health and gender identity problems that stem from childhood bullying. I tried commiting suicide last week by hanging myself but failed after panicking. I ended up just throwing up all over the bathroom once I got the rope free.I have steam and I like to play games, or used to at least..."
What am I supposed to do?,"I've dealt with depression for most of my life and never before did I think killing myself was okay; I never  considered it. Now I'm thinking about it all the time. A few weeks ago I went to the emergency room. I didn't have a specific plan so they referred me to a day treatment program. I spent 3 weeks there.I'm not better. I'm probably worse now, because it feels like I've exhausted my options. Therapy hasn't helped, my medication isn't helping, not enough at least, spending 6 hours a day in the hospital didn't help. The only other option seems like inpatient but I heard nothing but horror stories from the people in my program. I don't want to end my life but I don't know how to stop the thoughts, no one can tell me, and I feel like at some point I just won't have the strength to fight it anymore.Every time these feelings come up I'm researching a little more, putting my affairs in order. Each time feels like it could be the last..."
I feel like a fraud,Does anyone else feel disconnected from the physical world? I feel like a lot of the times I'm operating on auto pilot. As if the person who inhabits this body is different from the one who everyone sees on the surface. I feel like a fraud to everyone. It's as if the laughter and enjoyable moments are fake and the thoughts of suicide are the only things that feel real. As if that's what my purpose is and that's where I belong. Just dead.
People don't give me any rational or worthy answer to survive.,It's completely irrational to live in this world. The answers I've received to stay have no effort or thought put into them.  The ones that say it's not worth it put plenty of detail and relatable emotion. It's a fucked up world and you are ignorant if you see other wise.
I keep imagining life as someone else,"Someone who's confident.Someone who doesn't take things personally when they're not meant to be.Someone who knows how to be assertive.Someone who doesn't give a crap about what people think.Someone who doesn't find it hard to talk to unfamiliar people.Someone who could fit in.Why can't I be that? I feel like the way I am now prevents me from doing all that. I have 0 confidence, 0 assertiveness, 0 social ability. Maybe I can work to ""become that person"" but that would take way too much work. I'm undisciplined and I frequently perform less than my best on work, chores, and even things I do for fun. I don't even do much anymore because I'm unmotivated to. A lot of my lack of confidence stems from my dreams getting crushed a year ago. I don't see the point of trying to do much else if it's all going to be for nothing.I just want to die and reincarnate into someone with a better body, a better personality, a better everything. I keep trying to put on different names for myself. I keep imagining having a friend in real life I can rely on, and not just an Internet friend. I feel envious for people who aren't so lonely. I just think life would be better if I was born someone else.Except if reincarnation existed, I don't think you would be able to choose who you are in the first place. You're just assigned a body and you have no control over it. But even if it's not up to you, it would be nice to have another chance, and try to prevent growing up as a social retard. Maybe my next body won't have anger issues. They alienated me as a kid, and it's one of the reasons I never grew out of my shyness.Fuck me."
I want to tell people the truth,I am drunk and I just want let my guards down and. I really don't care anymore so ask my anything and I'll give you a 100% accurate (ok drunk) response. Any dirty secrets you want to know. Ask me now.
It's all coming to a close soon. I won't see 2018 after all.,"6 months unemployed, no source of income, and once my apartment lease ends in a couple of months I'll be homeless. My family can't take me in or help me in any way, and I don't have friends that would help.Just as well, I was always the broken one who couldn't survive in this world. No skills, no passion, no connections, no charisma, no nothing. I never deserved to exist in the first place.I can only hope the drop will kill me when the time comes."
Failing in life,"Here in my country (Romania) school is pretty much the most important thing for your future , I just started my last year of highschool and i can already tell it's going to be as bad as every other year , ever since 7th grade my grades have been worse and worse to the point where i barely passed , I'm a failure and a disappointment to my parents , I don't even deserve to live , not even those paid mentors can help me at this point , do any of you know an easy way to just end it all without it being too scary like stabbing myself in the heart?"
Completely Lost,"Where to start. So I'm 24 and my life's in a complete rut in every way. I graduated from college in 2015 with great grades but can't seem to find a job no matter the skill level or experience required. Basic jobs claim I'm overqualified and the jobs I want claim I'm underqualified even if its an entry level position. I studied a pointless major I never should have picked but I thought it would get me a job I liked whereas my brothers seemed miserable in their lines of work. But hey at least I have a mound of crippling student loan debt! I keep seeing other people I know who are able to easily succeed or get what they set out for which just makes me wonder if I'm broken or cursed or something. While in school I did find out that I have a knack for photography and videography which I've tried to pursue but to no avail. Been completely broke and living at home in an extremely dysfunctional household since college. Not even gonna talk about the ""relationships"" aspect of my life, I generally do nothing and barely talk to anyone on a daily basis even tho I was relatively social before this (even if it was by using the ""face/mask"" that I created). I've kinda always had an empty feeling inside (horrible childhood caused by constantly being picked on both at school and at home. Escalated to really really bad stuff I'd rather not get into right now) but in high school learned how to mask and ignore it so that other people wouldn't think I was weird/a downer (not that that's healthy). Mainly use humor/sarcasm to hide what I really feel. Pretty impossible to do now with nothing to occupy my mind which has just led me to believing that I'm a screwup who's completely useless and deserves to be where I am. Friends are clearly starting to want to hangout with me less/distance themselves now that I can't contain it as well. Served as their ""therapist"" for years as they claimed I was the most level headed person they knew and that I gave the best advice (ironic, no? like I said, I got good at masking) yet when I finally crack they don't like it. I never forget mistakes I've made no matter how hard I try. Tried suicide once before I even got to high school (never told anyone about that) and never thought I'd be in that state of mind again but I'm there. I guess its probably pretty obvious to assume from all of this but I've never really felt like I belonged anywhere. I have no idea what to do. Lost any desire or drive that I once had for life (even if it wasn't much to start with). Never posted on reddit or done anything like this before but had the thought today that I really wouldn't mind dying so realized I need help. So anyway, this is all new to me, whatever you got reddit. Go for it"
I'm weirdly attracted to the idea of being a 'Jane Doe'.,"Not only do I want to die, I also want to be one of those unknown or forgotten dead people. Like sure, I might get a bit of attention after the police or whatever ask people if they recognize my corpse or whatever, but then after that I would be no one. Just a 'Jane Doe'. A decomposing body no one cared or will ever care about. But with the number of blood test I've done in my life, many hospitals have my DNA so ... not gonna happen. "
"i'm shaking, i haven't had any food in 2 days.. i wonder what happens when i die",i lied to my soulmate and now we will never get together again.. but i can't live without him..
CO poison,"I live at dad's home, I don't accept responsibility, I give up on things simple as making food or logging to website correctly. Want to clean out garage for CO attempt but don't know where to put stuff. Spoke on phone maybe 10 times ever, longest conversation 30 seconds? No knowledge. Went to coworker apartment, nothing to say. Leave house minimal. Brain hardly works anymore from bad use. Takes me 1 week to do 1 hour work. I cried today because I went to buy a cable and I thought it was too difficult. I bought a dog treat for sisters dog but was afraid to tell her so I thought I might throw it at her house but I kept it. I don't care about following rules or reading instructions anymore. I just mix things and eat. I read random book pages and watch movie backwards. Supposed to be ""autistic""/Asperger. Anyway, is CO painless? Don't want to die but behavior is really really really bad my whole life, unrealistic to recover."
All prepped to go...,I�۪ve written my letters and prepared everything for my final exit. I keep my bottle of pills with me at all times because I am soooo ready go and don�۪t want any hiccups once I final initiate the act. A nice long swim out into the ocean after downing a full bottle of prescription sleeping pills is definitely in my near future. My advice: Don�۪t get married. Don�۪t fall in love. People are ultimately selfish and only care bout you when you benefit them in some way. Don�۪t be fooled and think otherwise. Don�۪t give up your life�۪s dreams or goals for anybody else ��� even family.
I messed up,"I went to college too soon. IDK about what classes to go to, about diplomas or majors, about how to do anything... I think I should have done more research before I went to make sure I knew what I was doing before I went but my mom wanted me to go as soon as I graduated HS, either tha  or get a job. I tried to get a job before but it causes me so my anxiety that I was scratching my arms till they bled and scarred. So I thought college would just be like school but it wasn't. I feel like I'll be able to pay off my loans and I won't be able to get a job either and I'm so stressed. I feel like I ruined my life. I have no job experience or anything to even put on resume except for like some volunteer work I did in HS. God. This is so hard. I don't know to be an adult and it seems like everyone else knows what they're doing. I feel so useless and money's tight rn and I need to be making money, but finding a job is so difficult. I'm so lazy too; i just sit around doing nothing because I don't got a job and I got nobody to talk to but family. I want to die so badly"
Nothing in my life has value,Not my self no friends no family they don't mean anything to me. I would try and kill myself but I would mess that up to.
Cant take another day. Help,Chronically PTSD and depression. Can't take it anymore I want to kill myself. Failed yesterday want to give another try. To afraid to do it but I want it.More then 5 years of treatment and drugs. Nothing worked.Easiest way to end?
Foolproof my suicide for me.,I'm planning yet again another suicide in hopes that this one won't fail again. Ive discussed it with one other person and i leave out the minor details so that they cant stop me when the time comes-but it seems they've discovered a fuck up in my plan. My poison of choice this time is CO poisoning. I baught an old car for this purpose. It's a 1994 cutless supreme. And I rented out a small garage unit for the car and my place of death. I keep the place a secret so that no one can interrupt and lead to another failed attempt. Problem is the car was made into a convertable and has a roll bar. I assumed it would work all the same since the garage unit will fill with CO still. But this person is telling me otherwise-stating I'd die of heat stroke first even though it has a working A.C. And won't explain the reasoning. Are they right or wrong?
I think I've had OCD since I was young and it's gotten worse,"First of all, I'm not 100% sure if I have OCD or not since I have never talked to anyone about it. But I do have some thoughts in my head + feeling the need to do some things a certain number of times. Anyways, I've always been attracted to girls and had several girl crushes. I did some research and I think I have HOCD, which is pretty much my the OCD telling me that I am gay. I got really paranoid and I keep on thinking about it. This resulted in the HOCD getting even worse, I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like it's trying to turn me gay or something. I know I am straight and talked to many girls, but why is this happening if I know I'm not gay? As a result of this, whenever I am walking outside or see a good looking guy, I start to check them out and notice how good looking they are. I never have any like sexual desires for them. But I'm so lost and on top of that I'm very stressed out + depressed so it's just not a good mix of things to have.I used to look at girls and admire their beauty and imagine them as my girlfriend, but like I feel like I lost that. Like when I look at a hot girl now, I don't feel that feeling I used to get. How do I tell myself that I'm not gay and it's just my brain playing tricks on me? This literally never happened until like two days ago. "
"Id rather be happy than dead, but at this point I would rather be dead than unhappy every day for the rest of my life.","If I could magically snap my fingers and obtain friends,an SO, and money I would never think about suicide again. I don't have clinical depression. There is no chemical reason for me to be depressed or for me to want death. Its just my fucking life and the incredible pain it brings me. All I want is to be special or important to someone. I get why Im not. Im not a very nice person, nor am I a very interesting person, nor am I at all attractive. But it still hurts to be so alone, even if I understand the reason for it."
Whatever,"Mid 20s, no friends. low wage job that ends next month. over 40000 in debt to school i never finished because i was too busy trying to work to pay for it. other bills. family hates me. sister regularly tells me to kill myself. mother wants me out of the house. i have no money for rent because loans and bills and i have no friends to crash at... literally 0 friends. soon ill be homeless, amd without a job, even though it paid shit.give me one reason to not pull a nike cause i cant think of one."
"24 year old, autistic, low giftedness and father and brother who are both engineers. Yep. I can't take it anymore.","Yeah, I failed school miserably and I can't deal with everyone being better than me. What is there left of life?"
I don't think I can do this anymore,"The expectations I place on myself are crushing. With my PTSD that my nmom has caused, I'm not able to function at the level I should for school. It will be a wonder if I pass. My father will not be happy, and is already disappointed in me for my change of religion. I'm quitting my job as I'm not in the right place mentally, and am feeling suicidal. I need to continue school though. I can't drop out or take a medical withdrawal. I haven't been able to attend class because of my anxiety and panic attacks. It's just this one class. I am very unhappy. I can't do this I need a break from school but I am unable to! I need my GPA to stay over a 3.0 to add a translations studies certificate. Not many understand what I go through. "
No job and feeling worthless,"After 21 years of being an office clerk, mostly doing it support, I got laid off.. They offered me another job which is very stressful and hard. I feel very conflicted. On the one hand its good to have a job, on the other i'd rather kill myself.. At the moment i'm reading up on methods that are painless.. I have no one to talk with.."
Don't see the point anymore,"16 years old, just started 6th Form at school.
I'll be honest, I just don't really see the point anymore. I've been a music and academic scholar for 3 years now, coming onto 4, and the demands on my time are ridiculous. It's a boarding school, so they can pretty much do with my time as they please. I'm taking Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Further Maths; all subjects that I enjoy, but I'm definitely struggling to keep up with the work load. For the past 3 years my extra curricular activities have so far been rugby, and thats about it. In 6th form, you get to do a race, called the Devises to Westminster race, which is an incredibly long kayaking race in England. Takes a few terms of dedicated training to get to the required skill level, but it's an incredible experience. Had my first ""on water"" session today, and due to a minibus breaking down on the way back from the river, I'm about 30 minutes late for a termly Music Scholar meeting. I go to see the head of music to apologise, and I try to explain what happened, but he just shrugs and says ""it's always this and that, never your fault."" "" I'm not performing the roles I'm expected to as a scholar."" Now fine. I understand where he's coming from, as I'm saving 15% of a �30k yearly tuition from this scholarship, so obviously they expect something in return. He asked me, after the bollocking whether I wanted to be a scholar. He said he was more than happy to phone my parents and tell them I was no longer a music scholar. I said of course not, I want to be a scholar. However, that's just a lie. I hate being a music scholar. Being an academic scholar is fine, as they only have weekly lectures, but when the time I have to catch up on work, my free periods, my free time before and after breakfast and supper, and occasionally my weekends, are taken up by this musical demand, I just can't take it anymore. I just want to be able to spend an afternoon with my friends, but instead, I have daily music rehearsals for a handful of groups, and instrumental lessons where I learn nothing. Now, with  this added work, and all the additional work I need to do for Further Maths, I feel I can't anything. My parents have asked me whether I really want to be a music scholar, and I feel like I have to say yes. The tuition fees are �30k a year, so with 15% off for Music and 15% off for Academic scholarships, on top of a 35% bursary, we're already being given huge savings on tuition. I don't know much about my parents financial situation, but I know enough to know that I would not be able to stay at this school if I lost my music scholarship. I'm sure we could amass the money somehow, but with my Dad having recently retired, I just can't make them do that. So if I stopped, I'd have to change schools, right at the start of one of the hardest couple of years in my education. I've been here for 4 years now, and I see it as my home away from home. I know everyone, I know all the teachers, and I have become close with lots of people. I can't leave now. I just feel like everything would be so much easier if I just ceased to live. I don't understand why I'm even trying to live through this, and it just strikes me as such a clear option. It's about the only thing I can think of that can solve this. I don't want to have to wake up every morning to take part of a routine I hate. It would be so much simpler to not wake up. Knowing I now can't go kayaking, the only request I've made, is the final straw. If I can't even do ONE thing that isn't music, or just a standard compulsory sport, I just don't want to do anything. I can't do climbing, I can't play golf, I can't go swimming, I can't do anything all of my peers are spending their time doing. I'm just rambling now, but it really makes me sad. My sister had depression, and my parents had to deal with that, and they were fine. They understood what she was going through, and she understood that self-harm was her coping mechanism. I feel that they'd learn to understand the choices I'd made, and I think that makes me feel less of a coward. Well that's it."
Forgiving oneself doesn't make sense to me,"I just don't understand why it would be acceptable morally to forgive myself for things I've done or said. The only thing I've heard is that it's practical and you can't move on with life unless you have, but it being practical doesn't make it right. Why would I deserve to move on? Worse though my self hatred is more just a way to not feel so bad about being stuck in the past. Idk I'm not too commuted to this post I just haven't talked to anyone in a really long time."
Hurting,"Keep having these strange dreams wanting to end it all but I know if I give in, Will I truly reach happiness or will it be just an empty void like my life currently is. Going through life trying to fake being happy not to worry anybody. Knowing deep down inside, I am hurting. Trying to find myself but finding nothing. The therapist I was seeing didn't ""get it"", His logic was, ""Well if you would just go out talking to people you would be happier."" No, That's not how it works. I want to meet people but its hard when you are so miserable that you just want to be alone and you got people trying to talk to you that don't get it. I see all my friends have moved on in life and are living on their own while I am stuck living at home. Barely scraping by. Working at most 7 months out of the year because of my seasonal status at my job. Can't even get a full time job. It blows. I used to be able to say, ""It will be worth it in the end."" I graduated seven years ago and still am living at home. Never went to college. I am over 400 pounds. I know I need to lose weight but its hard when you just don't care what happens. I have tried reaching out to my parents but they don't understand. My dad is just like, ""Deal with it. Everyone has problems. It's life."" How can you say that to someone? Especially your own son but I should have seen that coming. He has no sympathy for anybody. His logic is if somebody is that depressed and wants to die to just do it. Little does he know that him saying that cuts like a knife. His views on therapy are it's a waste of time and money. Said all therapists are just people looking to exploit weak-minded people. Not necessarily true. I will hopefully get through this in one piece and not do anything drastic. "
These assholes need to stop feigning concern when they're the ones driving me to the edge.,"I've been at my workplace for 5 years. I've always done my best to do a good job, rarely miss, etc. Year after year I'm stuck with the most draining, difficult, and impossible tasks. The people who show up and do nothing else are given the ""fun"" tasks, the easy tasks. The tasks that end up in the newspaper while I'm grinding away with the worst of the worst. They obviously hate me. They obviously like seeing that I'm stressed out and upset ,that I'm at the end of my rope. So yeah, don't fucking ask if I'm ok, or if I'm ""Feeling better"". Stop dumping all the shit in this place at my goddamn door and sitting back as I fall apart under the pressure. Fuck. Them. I've never been this close to actually going through with it. I have to care for my mentally ill husband, but I'm afraid at some point it's gonna win out over even that."
My mom is the only thing stopping me.,"I hate my life. My life is centered around music but I'm mediocre at it. I've never been good at school, I don't have any friends, I found the love of my life but that ended, blah blah blah, the usual. At night when I go to sleep I hold back tears and my chest feels heavy. I've felt this way for most of my life. Nothing is worth it to me, except my mother. She is my everything.
    I was raised an only child by my single mom. My mom is still single, her dog is getting old, and I just moved back in with her because she moved closer to where I work and go to school. I'm all she's got. She is an incredible person and she's given me the most unconditional love. She has struggled and endured so much throughout my life just to make sure I have gotten everything I need. She knows I'm sad and tries to help, but she can't.
    I'm just looking for a reason to live or a reason to die. I've already written letters, I have a life insurance plan to get money for my mom when I die. I'm in this awkward grey area because I want to be dead but I don't want her to hurt."
Tell my why I should end it right here and now,"There isn't a single symptom of depression (and anxiety) I don't have. There is nothing I enjoy, nothing I look forward to, no place to call home."
What am I doing to myself?,"I just recently graduated college, and have an education degree. I have my initial teaching certificate, but I'm not using it. I hate seeing teachers treat students simply like some robots that need to be able to pass tests. So I doubt that my co-workers would understand my priority to make students independent thinkers, rather than treat teaching as some job with shallow requirements. I fear of being alone in my career, so I don't pursue it (I know, it's selfish. I should work for my students).I don't want to tell my family or my two friends about my loneliness because they would include me more because of my selfishness, rather than because I'm a good man. Nor do I want to scare them. Yet, I do want to be closer with my friends and family, but I know that they don't want to because I'm boring, awkward, and take everything seriously. Who the hell wants to hang out with someone like that? I don't blame them. So, instead I've been working 75 hours a week the past couple months at two part-time jobs, not to make ends meet, but to distract myself from my loneliness. The simple-minded endless work keeps my mind busy during the day, and helps me fall asleep at night.I was just offered a teaching job at the number 1 school in the county, since their math teacher was fired midway due to some extenuating circumstances. I'm going to see the school in a couple days, but I want to turn it down. I just want to push my two friends and family away, ignore them, and just work.Because downtime alone makes me hate my damned boring self. And working at schools has made me depressed from seeing how much some poor teachers have hurt these students, and from how much more I could have done for them.I don't want to be alone, but I don't want to bother my family and friends even more. I'm just moving in some direction, wanting to give up every step of the way.What am I doing to myself?"
I'm not motivated to die,"For one, I feel like I still have debts to pay. There are people who've helped me in life that I don't wanna leave hanging. I'd like to see my parents retire, and I'd like to pay for my little brother's higher education. But I no longer enjoy life. Nothing really gives me pleasure. Sex and Romance bores me these days. It's not special anymore. Money feels hollow. I can't trust my friends anymore. I guess I'm at the bottom of a valley now. Stable point, not really motivated to live or die, but if I were to suddenly get notice that I had days to live, I don't think I'd be upset.Being at point where I'm ok, even eager, for death, but not motivated to seek it out aggressively is honestly damaging me and I'm not sure what to doI'm not sitting here with a gun in my mouth, but if someone came through that door and shot me right now, I'd be more grateful than regretful I guess I'm a little confused in life, and I don't to make any rash moves"
I was talked to at work today,"My coworkers noticed my being weepy and teary. I had the head of the company asking me if I was suicidal and I had to assure them that no I was not. The truth is, I have been since childhood, only planning it the last couple of years. I had a set date for September 8th and got invited to a birthday celebration. It was nice because I'm incredibly isolated and have no friends. I ended up drinking too much and upsetting the individual celebrating and was asked to leave. Another coworker later called me and threatened to get me fired. I'm so distraught, so overwhelmed, so eaten by sadness I can't see straight anymore. The man of my dreams, the one I have always wanted, has made me wait nearly six years for him to move in. We're hundreds of miles away from each other and I have been patient. I have tried. I'm nearly 30, friendless, and my love would rather be in a shithole of a town with no future than come here and build one with me.I am tired. I'm so painfully lonely I can't stand it. I harbor an incredible amount of shame and guilt. The only thing that stops me from ending it is my mom. I don't want to wake up any longer. "
Not sure how much more I can take...,"I'm not sure where to begin, exactly. I fear this post will just turn into one big pity party, but here goes nothing...I [M/25] am deeply depressed. Not the ""crying and sad"" type depressed. More like the ""I feel absolutely no pleasure from living and see no point in living"" depressed. I no longer wish to live, but I can't bring myself to commit suicide because it would devastate my family too much. In fact, I believe it would cause my sister and father to commit or at least bring them to the brink of suicide themselves. I feel hopeless and trapped. I wish that I had a terminal illness so that I could die sooner or at least see a way out, but nope. I'm stuck feeling trapped inside of a body and brain that wants to kill me/wants me dead. I smoke cigarettes and I constantly wish that I would get terminal cancer so that I wouldn't have to kill myself. It's far more acceptable to die of a physical ailment than a psychological/psychiatric ailment. I feel so guilty for feeling this way because, all things considered, I have a ""good life."" I have a family that loves me and supports me, I have good friends, I have shelter and food and basic necessities. I am musically inclined. I'm not ugly. I do occasionally enjoy nature and I have a good sense of humor sometimes (hard to tell in this post, hah). But depression just sucks the life out of me. I have difficulty holding down a job due to the depression and crippling anxiety. I have difficulty remembering things. My cognition is very poor most of the time, etc. I just don't see anything getting any better. Ever. I've been waiting for over 10 years now for medication and exercise and therapy and several hospitalizations to do  to help me, but it hasn't done enough to make me feel like life is something that I want to continue with. I don't know what kind of replies I'm expecting on this. Sorry if I sound like I'm griping or bitching. I just feel hopeless. I'm sick of living. "
"I've gone overdrawn in my bank, I've had a really bad summer, another stressful year of university is coming up, work is terrible, my life is nothing but just mundane tasks and I'll never be happy.","I guess this is the end for me, 22 years and I've been nothing but worthless. "
Wouldn't my suicide be seen as human evolution? Help?,"I mean, let's be honest, suicide is a weakness that nobody wants so if I ever commit suicide, it means that the bad genes which are negative and not needed go away from the gene pool thus making it one person lesser in the negative gene pool.What do you all think? I really want to make a post about my story of suicide but I'm afraid it will go unnoticed just making me angry for typing all that."
Shotgun ready to go,"Finally got the shotgun. Date set for this Friday 9/15 for personal reasons. Why? Suicide myths debunked, at least for me.  ""It's a temporary solution to a permanent problem."" Not for me. Been suicidal for nearly 10 years, been planning all along. I am suicidal over a cosmetic issue that will never resolve or get better.    ""Don't do anything rash."" Been planning for 5 years, suicidal for almost 10.  ""Get help."" Have had no fewer than 5 psychiatrists, tried 7 or 8 different medications, several inpatient hospitalizations have not helped. Family gives me shit all the time, they fucking hate me. Friends do the same. What ""help"" should I be getting here?""Your family and friends will hurt."" Good. They have and continue to make me hurt over and over and over. Why should I suffer just so they can keep living their shitty lives making other people miserable? I have asked them for help, I have asked them to stop, I have asked them for grace. Nothing. More laughter, more teasing, more shitting on me. I have NEVER once mocked my family or friends, always done my best to be there for other people, and what do they do? Mock me, laugh at me, fucking call me a freak. I hope they fucking suffer.    So give me one good reason why I should keep living? There's no solution, no help, no family and friends I care about. This isn't temporary and will not resolve.   "
I'm a fat good-for-nothing,"I used to be anorexic, but then bulimia came and I gained 60+ lbs. Now I'm overweight and all disgusting looking. I have finished high school, but I missed out on uni, so now at 22, I'm jobless, living at home with my mom. I basically can't find any enjoyment in life, everything seems so empty and boring. Therapy and meds are fucking useless, they don't do shit for me. When I try to eat healthy and exercise I just go back to not eating or binging for weeks. I hate my body, my life, I've tried to kill myself before, but was too much of a fuck up to actually succeed. I just wish I would fucking disappear, I have only one friend who supports me, but I feel like he is going to leave too. Wouldn't be that bad though, then I could finally off myself. I know overdosing on meds is hell, but I still feel the urge to do it... maybe for my birthday as a present for my shitty self."
suicidal but I don't know why,I'm a freshman at college and i was doing pretty well but now I am feeling greatly distressed and having suicidal thoughts ever since I woke up this morning. I am stressed about one class that I am having attention difficulties in and also about my relationship but I feel like thats not a good enough explanation for why i pulled a bunch of pill bottles out and stared at them for a good while wondering if i can do it. I went to my university's counseling center this morning but i thought i was feeling better but on the walk back i just felt worse. I dont know what to do. please help
any advice ?,"after getting forcibly thrown to different places to help them with what they wanted, i lost everything, future career,academic records, the right kind of connections, friends and lastly the mentors. when people ask them what happened, they say its my fault....when apparently its theirs, i even got told that i should not blame situations on them when clearly i was in control, nobody forced me to do anything.. when in reality they forced me to even quit even the very seminars that i wanted to attend to...ended up finding a job, found one but requires ALOT of documents to be passed...things that requires alot of academic and scholastic records that were either ruined, destroyed or long time lost in the process.... i want to quit, but i can't...considering that i have lost alot, i might not last this long... if incase situation got bad...i am even willing to end it considering that i already have nothing left to lose.     i'm lost and confused...."
I think this is the end.,"I don't even really want to ask for help right now. I've made what I'm calling my last meal and I'm currently enjoying it. I've fed my cat and set everything up so he won't go without if I follow through. It's been about a year of wanting to die and I am in therapy but it feels like a crock of shit. I know I'm not alone. I don't hate myself. I'm not even really sad, I just don't care about anything or anyone except my cat and I'm starting to feel like he'd be better off without me. I've been trying to care, to give a shit, but I can't even pretend anymore. I've been letting my apartment go to shit, garbage is piling up, my sink is full of dishes, I can't afford to pay any of my bills. I feel like a burden whenever I try to talk to anyone about this. I've been spiraling down so badly, the only thing that even keeps me coasting at this point is getting high. I've been fighting this damn battle for over a decade and I'm so tired. I'm on so many mood meds now and none of them seem to make a difference. The people I love are starting to get tired of this bullshit too and I just don't want to be this huge fuck up anymore. I don't want people to worry about me. I don't want people to wonder whether or not I'm gonna kill myself. I'm so tired. "
No hopes left i think it's the time,"First, English is not my first language, I hope I can able to explain myself.I'm 25 years old, graduated from University 3 years ago. When I graduated I immediatly start to look for a job but I always rejected because you need to go Military in my country. 1 month after graduation I learned that my gf was cheating on me, this was the break point in my life. I become suicidal only thing I was able to think was suicide. I didnt wanted to think anything so I go to military but before going to military my dream company called me and asked me if I wanted to work with them i said i cant because i was going to military.So military service is over i return back to my parents home I kept sending resumes and applying for jobs. One day i found a great job. Interview was really good. After sometime they didnt called me so i called them they said they hired someone. And that someone was my ex gfs boyfriend. My long gone suicidal side was returned again i couldn't stop thinking it. I was failed againts him. This was 1.5 years ago.Im unemployee since that time. I make myself lonely im not answering anycalls from my friends i blocked them all because they all have good jobs working marrying and stuff, i don't want to face with them i dont want them to see me living a miserable life.I just want to disappear. I tried to jump off from 10 stories building today but couldnt do it because i don't have bravery to do it. I dont want to kill myself because of girl i want to kill myself because  I'm a failure and I wasted my life."
The only thing stopping me from killing myself is someone to take the plunge with.,"I never wanted to be singled out. In fact, I hate standing out, making an impression, being noticed, existing. Perhaps this is the reason I never wanted to kill myself on my own. It's been 5 years since I first attempted and failed and I know the only reason why I cowered at the last minute was that there wasn't someone there to jump with me. Am I a romantic at heart? Wanting to add tragedy to my short, misled life? Perhaps.
Am I a coward? Most definitely. My mental illness has followed me across life and I can no longer bare to exist with it. I have received attempts of help in many forms but it's gotten to be an embarrassment for me and my family now. Their daughter with a formerly bright future has only wasted their hard earned money and I feel only shame for what I am. My attempts at being independent only landed me in hospital and my attempts of being a student or employed led to me having a psychotic episode and I had to quit both. I wish I didn't want to achieve. I wish I didn't care. I am now a 22 year old woman in debt with no degree, no qualifications and no prospects. My beauty is also fading and this one thing I could say I had will be no more. Some people just aren't meant to be on this earth. I wasn't meant to survive. The only reason I survived was through modern science. By the process of natural selection I should have never existed. I try every day to show my worth in some way but all around me I can only see the drain I am having emotionally and financially on their lives. I have been given pills of all nature and they only lessen the pain by 20% at the most. I am in therapy and have been for years. I exercise daily, I eat well, I push myself to do things the voices tell me not to every single minute. I still fail. I've tried enough now. I just wasn't meant to be here. Once I find my partner then I will be saying hello to the clouds. "
I don't want to fucking die,Please
I'm miserable and without hope,"Every waking minute for me is agony. I am completely alone. I have no job, I can't finish college, I have nothing. I don't want to live. I can't get myself to feel good enough to improve my life. Nothing I try works. I don't know what to do when I have no hope of things changing. Experience has taught me that life only gets worse for me. I'm a complete fuckup. I have nothing and no one and I need help and support and love and can't get it. "
"Please someone help me, I dont know what to do.","I have just been trying hard my whole life but I am not getting anywhere. I hate that I am so useless. I am not clever, no matter how much i study I cant seem to get to a good grade. I tried experimenting different ways to study or just plain put in a lot more time into it, still did not get me anywhere. Whenever I think I did something right, I am wrong. I cant even be confident in my abilities because nothing i was ever even a bit confident at ever worked out. I cant absorb knowledge fast, I think its even safe to say I cant even absorb knowledge at a normal rate. I have quite a few deformities on my body that I have been very conscious about. I have pain everyday due to these deformities. Its like everything i go just turns to shit. Am i cursed? What did I do to deserve all this that happened to me throughout my life. I didnt asked to be born. The pain and anxiety i feel everyday is so painful. I rather I just die, it would be a lot easier for me. I dont want to make my family feel the pain of me dying, i know they care a lot for me, thats one of the reasons I havent done it yet. Please someone out there, help me, I am begging you, give me some advice, what do I do? I just wanted to be normal and achieve my dreams. Why wasn't I born normal like everyone else."
So i was at psychiatrist,He told me im socially undeveloped and its true i feel like he never had a problem like mine i just want to die i hate myself i dont want to be like this i dont want to feel like this and there is much more to it i hope he can help me but deep down i know nothing will help why�_ why i am crying so fucking much should just kill myself rly why keep going i dont want do be like this
"I need an urgent answer, I need help asap","My girlfriend just swallowed about 2 random pills (by random, she doesn't know what they are, but they were doctor prescribed for someone) and let probably like 15 sit in her mouth for ~10-15 minutes, I'm freaking out, will she be okay?

I hate this world,I wish someone could understand the pain and misery I go through everyday. First getting told by my dad who hates me and just calls me a disappointment every day and getting beat up at school. I just don't understand if I am nice to every human being I meet and I just try to be friendly to everyone but of course everyone hates me. Im sorry if it sounds stupid which it probably does and I know people definitely have way tougher lives then I do.
"""Help"" doesn't help so why should I even try anymore?","I've had many therapists and medications but I still have not gotten better. I've read countless stories here about how the ""help"" lines just make things 10x worse. I believe them because of how stupid the people on the other lines are and don't give one shit about you and just want to ruin you.Given that this really seems impossible to stop, why bother?"
"Girlfriend and best friend left me for ex, left job today, only family member that cares for me has cancer, car broke down, no friends.... Started writing my note today...

Son died,"He was born unexpectedly early at 24 weeks, he died two days later. It's not fair that a piece of shit such as myself lives, while an innocent, beautiful baby boy dies."
"I want to end it all, all alone, nothing to live for. Being alive IS hell","17 y/o here. I have been depressed and hopeless for almost my entire teenage life. My parents don't really give a shit about me, and I hate my mom for letting her alcoholic boyfriend abuse me when I was 11 or 12. At school I have mostly no friends beyond simple ""acquaintances"" who I say hi to and leave. I have a lot of trouble talking about my emotions to people in real life, and I often drive people away from me. This summer I had a group of friends who I hung out with frequently, this was the only time in my life where I have ever felt accepted and loved. The girl who I love only wants to fuck stupid tinder guys, and she leads me on because I am worthless. I'm so much of a retard I fucked things up with everyone and now I truly am alone again.Everyday I wake up I feel as though I am being tortured further with the weight of being alive. I can't stand the thought of living another day on this dejected planet where I am nothing. Unwanted is all I am. I wish I wasn't filled with so much rage. I've tried counseling, I've tried pills but there's nothing that can be done. I am hopeless.At school all I can think about is how much I hate everyone around me, and I get strong urges to self harm (hitting my self, cutting, beating my head on things). I know that if my life continues like this I will take my life. I hate living in my own body. I just want to be loved and love everyone but I never will get any of that. I want to be free from myself and my mind, I want to at least feel some love or something good before I die. "
"Its not that I can't anymore, its that I just don't want to","I just don't feel like going on anymore, and its not as if I've got a reason to, I have nobody to care about and nobody to care about me. Nothing that matters here. I have no friends and both of my parents are abusive. I just kinda wanna fade into the darkness and cease to exist. being alive hurt to much, i dont want to anymore. "
Nobody actually would seriously know or care if I was dead,"I'm thirty years old now. I was never one to have many friends. I'm not the type that adds everyone I meet only for five minutes on Facebook so they can show they have over one thousand friends just to elevate their social status. Nobody can possibly be friends with that many people which is why I'm more reasonable and only included those that I've known for years which is under 40 friends. For over a year now nobody has interacted with me on there and I've been active on there almost everyday in some way. I've commented on friend's posts which go unliked or replied to, they don't comment on my posts, and they especially don't return my personal messages. I even invited some out but no replies. My gps was linked on there and one day I went to the emergency room for a accidental overdose. I posted a witty but somewhat serious post on my profile that said something like ""Oops I almost kicked the old bucket. Folks pay attention when taking any medications so as not to overdose like me as it's not pleasant."" And none of my friends committed on that. I know they're active everyday and commenting on other people's posts. It was a few days after that when I returned and logged back in. My point is nobody would know or even care that I was dead, but I'm sure if they somehow found out I had died that they would try to get symphony from other friends about it just so people could focus on themselves. It would be like ""hey you know so and so died?"" Then the other would tell them they are sorry. When in actuality the friend hasn't interacted with me for years. So my point is if they found out they wouldn't actually be upset or sorry I was dead, they would only use it to get symphony for themselves. But it wouldn't even get that far because to them as far as they know I'm already dead. Just some loser that keeps popping up on Facebook's feed. I even phone texted some and they don't return my messages. And I'm not spamming them with texts either if that's what you think. I recently messaged those I had messaged before jokingly asking if they lost their fingers, but no reply and I can see they read it but they choose to ignore me and they all are on messenger a lot. Even the one I considered my best friend and whom I confided in I was feeling suicidal months ago no longer talks to me. And the thing is I truly have little to live for. I'm in a bad situation. I even came out and told them I was a virgin and never actually kissed or been kissed or experienced any kind of love at all because I was feeling suicidal and no longer cared to hide it. We did talk at the time and a few weeks after but we haven't talked for months now or I should say they haven't been interested in talking to me for months now. I guess it's all about social status. People see nobody is commenting, or posting on your Facebook, so they see you don't have any friends so they avoid you. I can't go into my life situation but I assure you I have little to live for, only pets, no gf, or kids, on full disability for physical reasons. So I have everything going against me and nothing for me."
Do i need to click-bait about how much i want it to end?,"I'm gonna start this of with background, I am a sixteen year old male who lives in the uk, i have now ceased having contact with my whateveritscalled at a childrens hospital due to my age, and cahms would not have me, as my case was not severe enough (aka i havent attempted yet) this is because just like in america depression is an epidemic, so i understand they cant help everyone. I recently changed school, i left behind my peers by my own choice. I choose to change schools so that i could attempt year 10 again, i spent this year not doing a lot, as i struggle with motivation, i was working in a separte unit and didnt do much work. Every day was a struggle. So i made a change, if i hadnt changed school i would have killed myself by now purely because i felt stuck, like death was the only way out. New school is as supportive as it can be.My new school only has 70 students at once, class sizes are 6 pupils max and i still struggle to stay in lessons. This new school is a specialist school. not special, as in catering for children that are in wheelchairs. Specialist means they have specially trained staff to deal with asd (Autism spectrum disorder). you have to have asd to get in to the school. so yes i am autistic.I only found out i am autistic like a year ago, so i still haven't quite come to terms with it. My older brother is also autistic, i share a room with him, always have  since i was born. This is the first problem. I have nothing against people with autism, but it does mean they are harder to be around, this makes forming new relationships near impossible at school, because my peers do not like change, i am a change. I am surrounded from autistic people wherever i am, home or school. It makes me have to think twice about anything i say or do since everyone is so sensitive.Autistic people claim to want to die a lot, every other day someone screams it down the corridor or says it under their breath in class. many of these claims aren't due to depression, this is their reply when something isn't going their way and they want it to stop, but they don't know how to stop it. This doesn't make it any-less taxing mentally, hearing young kids say they want to die so frequently can take a toll on you as a person. A large part of my anxiety and the moment stems from being in year 11 for the second time, year 10 attempt to feels like a waste of time when i look back, all my old friends who don't want anything to to with me, purely because i'm not easy to have as a friend, now are off going to college and getting apprenticeships, seeing all their prom photos and how happy they look, makes me sad, so i deleted social media. I am in the same spot i was last year, isolated and not communicating with anyone, i barely do any work due to the fact it all feels degrading at this school, i was predicted a* at my last school, because i haven't done any work and swapped schools, i'm predicted for d's now.I have tourettes, i only get physical ticks but no vocal, this affects my communication as it gets worst when i'm stressed or self conscious, my body jerking around does impede on my speech at times, which makes speaking in front of even one person a chore.I share my classes with kids the same age as my little sister. can you imagine how that feels? to have a younger sibling catch up to you? its feels crap.I had a accident on a school trip when i was younger and spent 16 months in a back-brace, i was about 12, i don't want anyone else to go through that at that young.I know my problems seem small compared to kids in Africa or other OPs on this subreddit, but that doesn't make me feel less crap, in fact it makes me feel worse, angry at myself.When i am angry at myself i break things, throw things and punch walls,( childish i know) i have always had a short temper, this lead me to my first suspension when i was in my old school, just because some kids where throwing pens at my back, which of course is a trigger for me. i stood up and punched one so hard in the face he fell of his chair. i feel bad, he was only doing it due to peer pressure. My squeaky clean record tarnished, and the other kids didn't get in trouble because the teacher was oblivious and no children advocated for me.Im done ranting, sorry if it looks bad but i don't exactly care."
Existential Crisis at 29���I feel like there's no hope for me. I don't even know why I try because I'm too stupid to do anything now that my prime is over. There's nothing for me to look forward to anymore. Who would want me? I'm alone and should go away.,"I just want to start with saying I appreciate anyone reading this. I don't want to bore anyone by going into my life story. But I feel like I have to give an idea how messed up I am.My best memories are from when I was four. I lived on the family farm with my mother and father and grandparents. Unfortunately, dad was an alcoholic. He was involved in an accident when I was five. Brain injury confined him to a nursing home. Mom couldn't handle the pressure and left with me. We moved to a trailer park. We lived in pretty intense poverty. I have ADHD. But I wasn't diagnosed until 25 after multiple hurdles; depression made evaluations difficult, due to memory loss symptoms with both depression and ADHD, they had to make sure I wasn't misdiagnosed.
I have so much hate for the teacher who made me feel like a defect in fourth grade. I never had recess because I struggled in school. I constantly felt like a bad kid. I was an outcast. I was severely bullied by the girls. I heard ""retard"" more times than I'd like to admit. One of the most damaging insults came from my teacher. ""I thought girls were typically smarter than boys."" He also prevented me from getting the help I needed for my ADHD���he didn't believe in it. I was ""just lazy"". Just a bad kid.
I struggled with shyness and dyscalculia. I would hide in the bathroom during my turn to ""show my work"" on the chalk board. Junior high wasn't much better. I had a few good teachers who I felt safe around. One teacher told us that the non-college bound classes were meant for students who'd become worthless adults. Mr. Shomaker also had a tendency to try to look up our skirts. I realized later that that's why he put us in the front row.I'm deeply insecure. Not only do I have learning difficulties, but at twenty I developed terrible cystic acne. What could be better? Ruin my fair skin, of course it had to happen. It destroyed any confidence in me. At twenty, I ballooned to 220. I was failing college and felt very lost. I worked at Radioshack part time. I just remember my supervisor waiting until other employees left, then he'd tell about how bad my face looked and how heavy I was. He acted like it was something I could just scrape off my face, like he was doing my a favor. He was a disgusting pig. Never worked, piled all the responsibilities onto us. He'd shed his nasty pubic hair-looking chest hairs in the register keyboards. At remember at 22, crying my eyes out while stocking the numerous tags that exhausted my short attention-span, thinking how much I'm failing at life.
I finally quit that job, but it haunted me for years. I stayed because I knew I'd couldn't do much better anywhere else. I also worked at I applied twice at a call center and was finally hired. I've gone to therapy, where I wasted hundreds feeling like even more complete garbage. The only benefit was my last counselor. A little old man who recommended going to a gun range to relax me. At 25, my aunt called me to let me know my father had died of a heart attack. I briefly dated a man who seemed interested in dating me, but he was suffocating. Pressuring me to move with him and buy a passport. After two months, he suddenly switched and started accusing me of horrible things. He sent me texts that I deserved everything bad that's ever happened to me. I then found out he was seeing someone else, but just couldn't tell me that. I wanted to die. I spent several years very depressed. Occasionally venting on Facebook (yeah, I'm not bright). I was told online to go kill myself by a drunk former classmate from high school. I'm fairly sure I was mourning my dad around this time. I think being dumped brought that out in me. I just wanted someone to care.I'm 29, I work in a call center where I feel stuck. I can at least say I've never ever done drugs (just caffeine) or stole from others. Ive lost a little bit of weight by exercising. I'm also not a terrible artist at least. But I feel like I'm past my prime now. I missed out on the college experience, finding myself, making friends. I'm also a hopeless romantic who just wanted to find a guy who loves me, but I feel so ugly. I guess I have daddy issues. I've never been good enough for a guy to love me. Who the hell would want me? I'm a pale blonde with bad skin. I'm ruined and I'm just going to become uglier.
I also never moved out, mostly because my depression would isolate me further. I'm the female equivalent of a basement dweller. I have few friends except my dog, she's the only reason why I'm still here.
I'm so sorry.TL;TR: I'm a chubby 29-year old girl with ADHD, cystic acne scars, college drop-out, I have only had one boyfriend in my life, every other man has always left me. My dream was to be a cartoonist or some kind of artist, but I feel like it's too late for me, and I should end my life soon as my small family dies off. "
I can't stop thinking that suicide may be the best option.,"I'm 32, I was born with cerebral palsy. All my adult life I heard from people how cushy it must be to live off their taxes because I got disability.In 2009 I enrolled in college and earned an Associate's in medical billing. I graduated in 2013 and stayed on to earn a Bachelor's in Management which I earned this year.At the time I was making $675 a month disability but was able to live because of my best friend and roomie who helps me with bills.In 2014 I took on a job and alerted social security, I was told I had 3 years I could work. I was never told I needed to show them my paystubs, I gladly worked and attended class feeling happy to be working, to be in class. I'd show the people who called me a leech that I could be more, I'd get off disability for myself.It's 2017, I've graduated, can find no work and have now been told by Social Security that I owe them $26,000 in over payment because I was never supposed to get payments from 2014 onward.They had my employer send them a 3 year print out of all my earnings, when I called them to ask why I owed and why, if they needed me to turn in my paystubs they never told me, they replied, ""we don't have to tell you, you were supposed to know.""I called them today to plead my case, that with rent, student loans, etc, I only have around $100 a month left, and that I barely make over $1,000 a month since my benefits stopped.I was told that I should send them, ""at least $100 a month, more if you can, even then it will take you 21 years to pay us back, you want to get this done sooner if you can.""I feel so fucking hopeless. All I wanted to do was have a better life, an education. To stop hearing, ""must be nice to sit on your ass and live off MY taxes.""Now I'm in debt I will never get out of, every attempt to find work has fallen through (I can't drive as it's $2000+ to put hand controls in our car), and I just, why go on?I only haven't killed myself because I can't bare the thought of my best friend finding me. I don't love much, but I love her too much for that."
I don't know how I can get help.,"sorry if this is hard to make sense of, I feel like I don't know anything anymore.
I was 8 years old when my parents got divorced, from then on until I turned 13 and had the courage to not go back to my father's house, I was physically abused half the time I was there. Always for no real reason. I found out that he was into BDSM shit like that, and I don't know what to think of those years now knowing this.
Anyways, all I can remember from my childhood is traumatizing shit, and the stuff that isn't, I don't even know if it actually happened or it's just a dream or my head just making shit up. I'm young I guess, still in highschool. 10th grade. Last year was horrible, I would be crying every other day in class just from not knowing anything and from what I would think others would think of me. I changed schools after first semester, didn't show up for almost 3 months and failed all but 1 class. I wasn't in a good place. Constant delusions, couldn't justify keeping up with basic hygiene unless I had to see someone who probably knew me, because I didn't want anyone judging me for any reason. One of the nurses or whoever at the second school brought something up which led to me having a panic attack, to them calling my mother and practically forcing me to admit what happened back then. My mother didn't care about it. Assuming it was just nothing, and proceeded to yell at me over failing classes.
I had one close friend then a couple others who I'd talk with on a regular basis, but I recently moved almost 900 miles away and I can feel that the internet won't keep those friendships together.
I have no friends at my current school, and since I've been here we have only had enough money to get by. Everyone else here isn't like that.
I feel scared to say anything at my school since there are papers hung ALL OVER the place about suicide and I heard a classmate talking about how she's going to report another girl at my school because of her being depressed. And I feel like I can't say anything to my mother or her fiance because I feel like they'd just tell me to get over this. I tried talking to two of my old friends (~900 miles away) about a little bit of how I've been feeling/thinking and the only response I got was that I'm ""crazy"".
Since February I've gone pretty much every day just overall thinking of suicide and simply not being here. I don't see any point in living besides I don't want to possibly hurt anyone because of it in the future.
I would attempt to get help if I could, but I don't know how.
P.S.: mentioning that others have it worse doesn't help.
(sorry again for my shitty writing. there is other things going on with me but I don't feel like mentioning it because I just don't know how to word it. )"
I'm pathetic,"I know this is going to sound overly dramatic, but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old, I jump to ""dramatic"" conclusions quickly. I've been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I've realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials.
Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn't afford all of this. My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit.
On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it.
I've heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn't completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments. Don't really want to think about it right now but I'll do it anyways. My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I'm on my own.
I'm not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die. I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic. Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can't afford.
Fuck college fuck my painting class and fuck my stupid fucking life. I should have never been born."
I can't stop thinking about my suicide. I've been working on my letter all week.,"if you need help killing yourself then here's a recipie for a poisonous drinkstep 1: get a potstep 2:fill up to 3/4's water and put over stove till it boilsstep 3:go to the store and put in 3 spoons of Theobroma cacaostep 4:the Theobroma cacao is gonna be lumpy when you put it in so take your spoon and stir it till there are no clusters remainingstep 5:add in monosaccharides and magnesium hydroxidestep 6:add more of the Theobroma cocoa stuff and mix even furtherstep 7: now once the heat mixes it, take a cup and pour the mixture in
step 8: if you truly wanna do yourself over, drink 2 cups right before sleepingand that right there is how to enjoy the perfect cup of hot chocolatewait, you wanted to know how to kill yourself?so i just wasted 20 minutes searching up the scientific names of chocolate, milk and sugar for nothing?well shit"
Has anyone had a positive interaction with the 1-800 lines in America?,"I need to see if it's possible to  talk to someone to get through a not-quite-crisis moment, or does it always result in an intrusive police visit?"
I wish I had a gun,"One bullet is all I'm asking for, sadly it's impossible for me to get, and too much of a pussy to do it any other way.
I'm tired of it all.Anyone care to talk?"
I just took the scarf off my neck,"It felt different than I thought it would. More pressure on my windpipe, which hurt. I wanted to blood choke myself, pass out still in a noose and be done. But when it came too close to really being done, I realized I could do it later and in the meantime, not give a shit about what anyone thinks about me."
I'm still alone.,"I'm still alone and suicidal but I'm feeling better today. I still want to end my life but for some reason I'm continuing this pain. Nothing can fill the void I have, successfully - and it's making me feel worthless, but I don't want to end my life because if I do I'll never have happiness and a relationship. I just don't know what to do."
"Thoughts on suicidal ""impulses"" that aren't always associated with actual feelings of sadness, despair, etc.","I'm wondering if anyone else tends to experience this because I haven't really seen it discussed anywhere before.  Obviously when I'm experiencing particularly strong bouts of depression and feeling hopeless I dwell on thoughts of ending my life.  Outside of that, the rest of the time, though, I still have these like ""impulses"" or ""urges"" that seem completely disconnected from my mood or feelings.  Like, walking across a bridge, not thinking about anything wrong with my life, not experiencing anything that could be related to ""sadness"" or ""unhappiness"" or anything like that, sometimes I can even be really happy or upbeat at the time, but I'll still feel this strong drive or draw towards the water, like a magnetic pull towards the railing.  I ended up moving residences because I had to walk across a bridge to get to work from my old place and I wasn't sure I could trust myself forever.  Likewise with freeways, train platforms, the presence of firearms or strong pills, stuff like that.  I become pre-occupied with their presence and it's hard to concentrate on other things as my mind keeps drifting back towards that ""opportunity"".  It's not like when I'm going through a period of depression where I think about ending my life as an ""escape"" or because ""life isn't worth living"" or anything like that.  It almost feels like I'm considering the act just on it's own, for no reason at all. Just to do it, just because I can. Like the urge to scratch a mosquito bite or step on a sidewalk crack.  Does anyone else experience that?  Does anyone know of any literature or anything like that which speaks on it?     "
I hate that feeling you get when you feel worthless and useless! I just feel like I'm a spectator in this world.,"When I was younger, I remember saying to myself that I am a spectator of life that was because I loved listening to other people's thoughts and their stories. But now, it's still that, but in the worse way possible.I've started to feel like I've become a worthless and useless human being who is unintelligent and who's only goal in life is too be a spectator of life and never have any worth and meaning. I don't have a girlfriend, I've never had anyone else care about me aside from my parents and extended family, but they are kinda forced to love me.No one else has ever cared for me like my family and I just feel like I'm invisible whenever I go outside or when I'm at work or university. I'm not very intelligent and I feel inferior compared to everyone else I know!No one will love me and I've tried to kill myself many times, but I've never become scared of the idea to do it again. I have made many plans and some have fallen through while I've been close to actually ending it.I feel weak for not being able to kill myself and I want to do it again and again and again until I finally leave this world.I'm a worthless and useless human being, no one will care for me and even if they said they did, they really don't care! When I kill myself, I'll be forgotten. I'm going to try and call the Samaritans in the UK but I doubt it will be much help."
ready to join the statistic,"just wish there was an easy way.I just want to not do anything anymore.   Everything is a chore.   I've always said that sloth is my favorite sin.   I look at all the things I need to do.   I have a job, and it's fine... but I haven't been in a few weeks now.  I reenrolled in college again too, self improvement is vital to a future... but again... I haven't been since the first week.   And ok,  maybe you could say... noone likes work or school...Then I look at the things around me...  I have books to read and i just stare at them... I learned years ago that I never play the games I buy on steam and stopped purchasing... still so many things left untouched.   I've got friends who want me to go hang out or do things with them... but honestly, they are just searching for the me that was never real.   The me i created to 'succeed' in society.I franticaly find excuse to avoid these invites, to avoid anything new.   I hate thinking, I hate feeling,  I'm just so desperate to stop everything in my life.I can't afford to live like this, and I truly hope I can finally throw myself away tonight."
(very long post) I might be killing myself in a couple of years,"I know that you guys might be tired of seeing posts about the same problems all over again, but I'm feeling as if I really need to talk to someone who understands how this life works. Very long post ahead, please show mercy to me :( I've been suicidal for more than 10 years now. The first signs of depression appeared at about the same time. I'm 21 now, and I've already decided that I won't make it to my thirties, considering how problems just keep piling up as you get older. In fact, I have already tried killing myself by stepping in front of an upcoming train. Unfortunately, I was pulled back by some guy who probably thought I'd slipped on ice. In hindsight I understand how stupidly selfish this was, and I feel ashamed understanding how many problems I could create for the engineer and passengers. I'm thinking of using a more safe method now, and I've found a couple already. Now I just need to put them to test. This condition is a result of an extremely life-worsening combination of things, which make me a poor excuse for a human. First, I'm very anxious and shy around people. I physically can't stand their presence, all I want is to sit in a quiet corner with no one to disturb me. Unfortunately, as a college student, I must engage in social interactions on an everyday basis, and it's a kind of torment for me. I want to have true friends who would genuinely care about me, but I would have nothing to give them in return. I'm always sitting alone in quiet contemplation as they speak to each other and laugh and have fun, and I'm just there, like a monument to eternal sorrow and loneliness. Like an exile. I wouldn't mind having a girlfriend... But that's the next part.Another problem is, I'm ugly. And I mean it. Not ""people are closing their eyes in horror, scream and run away when they see me"" kind of ugly, but quite close to that. Logical conclusion: my chances of finding a girlfriend are non-existent. I've never been in a relationship, I don't know what holding hands with your loved one feels like, I haven't even been kissed. Feels like I'm missing out on a very important part of this life, but there's nothing I can do about it. Every time I think I learned to live with that, reality reminds me how miserable I am, and how easily such misconceptions can be shattered. Every time I see myself in the mirror, I regret not having a gun. At least that would spare people on the streets from having to look at this Beast without the Beauty. So many problems could be solved if I had attractive appearance, but I'm not a lucky person, and good looks are not for me. I'm always comparing myself to other people, and everyone - absolutely everyone - is better than me, with few rare exceptions. It doesn't work too good for my self-esteem, which went below the core of Earth long ago. One more reason to end this miserable existence.The third problem is, I live in a piss-poor third world country, which keeps getting worse every year. There is absolutely no chance of me ever leaving it, I have very little money and even fewer opportunities to make some. I always wanted to see what decent life means, how people live in Europe and the USA, but fate decided that I must rot in my cage without getting out of it. Sometimes it seems to me that sneaking aboard a freighter going across the Atlantic isn't such a bad idea. Jokes aside, I've been thinking of becoming an illegal immigrant due to how no legal options are available for me. But that takes balls of steel, and that is something I don't have. I'm too weak and soft to take any risks. The fourth problem is, I can't do things well. I can't do anything well. My only achievement in life was learning the English language, which is hardly of any help in my situation. There isn't much use to it when you're eternally locked in a country where people hardly know their own language, let alone any foreign ones. Apart from that, I haven't achieved anything. I can't draw, I can't write, I can't make music, I can't do what anyone else around me seems to be able to do with ease. Crying at nights is something I could master with a little practice, but it wouldn't get me anywhere. All in all, these problems combined make my life very difficult. I'm surprised I've lived that long, but I have a feeling that it's about to end quite soon. I'm pretty sure someone has been in a similar situation before, so I could use some wise words from the sages of this subreddit. But without ""it gets better eventually"", please. It doesn't."
The feeling of guilt....,"I don't know the best way to say it but..
I lost my only friends out of something stupid i did and now they hate me and have blocked me on all social media. I now have nothing to live for as I don't have anymore friends and no life , never been in any kind of relationship and now I'm over 350 pounds and still going .The guilt is very overwhelming and it's just making me suicidal and very depressed.  As of now I do not know what to do as that's why I am contacting reddit  "
I'm available lets chat.,"Anybody that needs someone to talk to can contact me.
Maybe i can help you see things from a different perspective.
In need of a friend? Dont hesitate.
Im just an average 35 yr. old guy from Florida."
Hit bottom today so I googled suicide methods...,And I chicken out.Just reading about hanging scared me. Very dark read and I'm fucking depressed!Does anyone else want to die but can't really go through all the process?
I hate my family for loving me.,My family is the only reason I'm keeping from killing myself. I didn't choose to be here. I didn't choose to live this shitty fucking life.
I DO NOT see a good reason to continue living,"I'm 22 with a good degree and no student debt, I'll probably land a stable job with good pay within the next few months, I have basically all the material comforts I want, but I still haven't been happy since I was 18. And that's because, socially, I'm just a fucking trainwreck. I haven't felt any sort of meaningful connection to any friends or acquaintances over the past four years, save for two people. One of the two ghosted on me two years ago. The other is busy all the time, and I still find myself afraid to ask her to hang out because I don't want to put more pressure on her.I've never had a girlfriend. I'm still a virgin. Up until a month ago I hadn't even kissed a girl. When I finally did, I was convinced that I finally figured things out and that I was going to get to have the exciting, blossoming social life that eluded me for the entirety of my time in college. But now, since going back to school (but still living the same distance from me), she's become pretty clearly disinterested in having any sort of relationship with me. And I'm left staring down the barrel of another holiday season spent by myself, in my room, drowning myself in media to distract from the reality of my own existence.I just don't see how things are going to get any better. College - the best chance I had to make friends and build a social life - has passed me by. I have no personality. I'm a timid bundle of nerves. From where I'm at now, it's hard to imagine ever meeting someone who's interested in me for more than a week. All the material comforts in the world can't get me past the loneliness and shame I feel over this. I've tried.So I'm left wondering what the point is in continuing with life if I'm probably going to stay as isolated as I have been over the last four years. The holidays are always the hardest time for me. Going out now and seeing Halloween decorations, knowing that I have nobody to share this time with, just wears on me so much. I already feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and we aren't even halfway through September."
I fucked everything up.,"So everything is shit. My boyfriend and I split up. And yesterday I was home at a friend where I got really drunk. Ended up kissing with my friend who has a huge crush on me. Which was a big mistake. I�۪m not in love with him, I was just drunk and sad.On my way home, I wrote to my ex boyfriend, how much I miss him and that I didn�۪t feel like living anymore. He got absolutely furious. Said he had to call the police and that he would never speak to me again if I ever wrote something like that to him again. And that I should hospitalize myself again. I ended up convincing him he shouldn�۪t call the police, but he is still mad at me, I apologised a lot.Ended up calling the suicide hotline, who just told me what I�۪m going through is normal after a breakup. I�۪m just so tired of being me. I�۪m tired of being schizophrenic, I�۪m tired of not being able to do anything. I miss my ex, I�۪m tired of always being left by the ones I love. I�۪m tired of being such a huge fuckup. "
I'm a fucking coward,I couldn't do it today. I drove around to find a billboard thing I could jump off of (I'm in Florida and cops are doing post hurricane damage control so they weren't paying attention) but I couldn't fucking jump. I'm so worthless. My friends and family are begging me to kill myself at this point. My best friend who I moved with here is even hoping I do it already and stop dragging my feet on it. Everybody knows I'm going to and nobody is going to stop me. My birthday was yesterday and all I did was get drunk during the hurricane and cry that I was still alive. I was supposed to kill myself years ago. I'm not worth shit. I'm a burden. They all want this to happen. I want it to happen. I would do it right now if it was a sure thing it would end my life permanently. I found some pro suicide blogs online and have been reading those religiously so I know which one hurts the least. Here's hoping I get the courage within the coming days. I can't live like this anymore
Use your depressive thoughts to live carelessly.,"This is a post for everyone of you guys feeling suicidal. Ive been there, many times...until I broke these patterns by realising what life really is. Its nothing, for all we know it could be a figment of our imagination. So go be careless, have fun, give zero fucks, in other words become sort of a hedonist. Whats the worst that could happen? You could die, which none of us here would mind so whats the point of cutting to the chase. Make the most of whatever existence is...and stop caring. Its so freeing!"
"If it wasn't for pain, I'd do it.","I mean physical pain. I wouldn't mind leaving my family behind. I guess I'm a psychopath, but if there was some kind of procedure that eliminates pain completely, I'd do it."
They say tomorrow is a new day but everyday is the same.,"More sadness, more loss, more misery, more pain, more wishing I was gone. I don't see why I should continue when it's always the same day."
*URGENT* Please help suicidal Redditor, is having some problems and they need support. Please help me help them. <3
Failing college. Don't know what to do. (Long Post),"22 y/o. had repeat exams and  I'm sure I failed them. This was the second time I was doing them and I'm not sure if I can get into college. Majority of my friends (>10 people) have left the city to other countries and my parents live 250km away. Can anyone give a good reason why I shouldn't end it now? I have only 1 friend left, I'm so tired all the time and I'm fucking failing in every aspect of my life. I exercise, I eat properly and try and get early nights but I can't ever feel happy. I have no social life, no one I can talk to, my future in college is up in the air and I just feel like I'm stuck in the mud while everyone's passing me by. apologies if I upset anyone."
i don't want to die but i feel like i have no choice,i'm stuck and don't want to suffer anymore
My sad life,"I will never be loved. My moment has come and past. I'm 27, spanish, ugly and virgin, and i never had a friend or a gf. My parents are disgusting people. School was hell, i was shy, everybody ignored me completely and two teachers bullied me for years. During my 5 years of college i tried to stop the isolation and did It ALL: therapy (2 kinds of It), forced socializing during classes, asking everyone how to be normal and make friends, i did meditation (during 4 years!) and yoga, i went to every open parties, smiling and talking to litteraly everyone that i could, i used social media everyday and asked out dozens of females during all those years (and get rejected EVERY single time). I enhanced my english so i could talk to foreign students too... I visited teachers during the hours you can do It, and talked about my problems with some of them. I had a diary where EVERY FUCKING DAY I wrote what i had learned that day, what have I done or Who Ive been trying to talk that day and positive stuff like that. I cleaned my room to the point It was like a monk room. I went to swim twice a week, and when i stopped swimming I began to run for an hour every day (alone of course...) I changed my clothes and hair more than 5 times, trying to hide my disgusting looks. I found a easy job during weekends two times, so i could meet  a even more people and i could pay therapy and medication. And yes, I did all these things and more while taking medication for my social anxiety. And during a whole year, i was a volunteer and helped some very old women with basic stuff like eating and going for a walk. I tried It ALL before graduating. And failed miserably. I got NOTHING from all of this. Just remembering It makes me feel sooooo tired (i could barely sleep If i wanted to study and change myself enough to have friends at the same time) I'm a failure, and my time has past now. Now I'm a isolated proffesional philosopher.I should be looking for a job now, but It doesnt worth.  I'm supposed to be a teacher soon, but i know i cant even see a teenager couple without wanting to end It all (i will never experience that) and beautiful Young women only make me feel like I'm done. Why should i get a job, or keep studying anyway? I don't want to be isolated anymore and those things are not going to help at all. Why trying ANYTHING If you KNOW Its not going to work? What should i do with the money if i can keep a job? More therapy? More medication? Expensive meditation? Going to parties? I cant share the money incould earn and i dont want It. Nothing is going to help.  Nobody can help me. My destiny is to be as lonely as a human being can be. Or to kill myself. And thats whats gonna happen. I'm going to jump from my rooftop one day or another, very soon. I smoke for an hour every night there, trying to find the courage to do it... isolation is so much for me now that i ran out of ways to scape It. Now Its just me and loneliness.Now i can barely think or feel anything at all. Im deeply depressed. My good days when i had hope and energy to change myself had past, because i know nothing can help me no matter how hard i try. I'm way too ugly, too beta, too boring and shy. Most of the time i can barely think at all,  i watched like an spectator how extreme isolation destroyed my mind, so right now, that i feel more lucid than usual, i wrote this. Most of the time i feel like a retarded person. One day i will end It all. And i really hope its happens as soon as possible. Because im so coward that i litteraly created this account on reddit so i could find the courage to kill myself.Sorry for bad english. ( I don't think i will be able to explain myself again before killing myself, lucidity is rare for me at this point, thats why i copy-paste this mess again and again, I'm sorry)"
Tomorrow might be the day.,"I'm not 100% yet but I think tomorrow is when I'll do it. I stayed home from school today because I just couldn't bring my self to go to school and do my work like everything is okay. Tomorrow I'll go. I'll dress cute, look pretty for my final day. Make sure to hug all the friends I care about for a final goodbye. When I get home I'll need to write several letters to important family members and certain people in my life. If you're wondering why I'm going to kill myself I guess I'll tell you why. My life was a mess. I was doing lots of shit I shouldn't do. Drugs, sleeping around, not respecting myself because I was depressed (I have diagnosed depression, it runs in the fam woohoo). But then something changed. My dad gave me the option to stay where we were or move to a new state because he had gotten a job offer. Even though I liked my life at the time because I had a few friends and would party every weekend, something inside me told me to move on. So I did. I came to where I currently live and my life changed so much for the better. I had a new, better reputation. People liked me (well a lot of girls were still bitchy that's never changed) and I met someone. I met him. Everything about him was perfect and we instantly clicked. Best friends and lovers. He knew everything about my past and the low things I had done and he loved me anyways. I knew everything about him too. I've never had such an honest and open loving relationship with someone. He really was the one, as dumb as that may sound to u.
Well this summer something changed and we had a huge fight over something he had done (not cheating). I was so mad at him and even though I forgave him, for months afterward I acted childish. Always mad over small things. Always being too overprotective of him. We had both always been overprotective of eachother but since then I took it to the extreme. And I knew I wasn't behaving the right way. But at the time I didn't give a shit. Because I was still mad at him. But that doesn't mean I didn't love him. I love him more than anything. And we still had tons of happy times but I guess the bad times canceled those out. And I guess Im an idiot because I ignored him when he warned me he wasn't happy like this. And then last weekend was the breaking point. He came back from a trip and told me he wanted to break up. He was serious. I fought for him and begged him and told him I really would change the way I'd been acting. Finally he agreed that while I went out of town the following weekend we'd have a mini break. He promised to keep an open mind and also stay loyal to me of course. Some time away from eachother. So we didn't call and barely texted and it was the hardest thing ever. Someone who's been in your life constantly for so long.
Well. Yesterday I flew back. And I had lost hope over the weekend but I didn't let myself feel the pain. I told myself not to worry because in 2 days I can just take the pain away. Forever. Well yesterday I did something foolish. I let hope creep back in. I had hope he would listen to me and believe me I'd change. He didn't. He's heard it before. But I meant it this time I did. Bc losing him was at stake. I tried everything and I spoke to him from my heart and he didn't care. He wouldn't do it. And I'm devastated.
I'm so mad at myself for taking him for granted. I love him and I'm so sorry. I wish I could go back in time to take it all back. And at this point I don't care anymore. I don't want to move on. I can't imagine seeing him with anyone else. I can't imagine myself talking to anyone else.
So. Tomorrow's the day I think. I just have to pick a sure method. Either Gabapentin od, slicing my wrists (or a combo of both for sure outcome) or jumping off a cliff/building. Congrats if u read my miserable story to the end. No advice please. I don't care if things get better. Blah blah. I don't care. I'm done. "
I hate my life.,"I think about killing myself everyday, I dont have anyone or anything to keep me stay, theres nothing that makes me happy, Ive lost interest in everything, and I dont care about anything, life wasnt meant for me i wish i wasnt born."
Over and over,"In my head, ""Put a gun to my head, pull the trigger, now I'm dead.""Constantly, I say this over and over and over. I imagine in my head of actually doing it. Even doing it with my fingers to my head. The tingling sensation at the side of my head I feel when doing it. Echoes of telling myself to kill myself. Repeating, ""I hate my life,"" in my head all the time. Over and over. "
This is a positive one! A lesson learned,"Like most people here I blame myself for my situation more I can blame anyone else. I've always been very bad with anxiety, to include hospitalizations. Research says it's from a shitty home life and parents that didn't live up, but a natural side effect of that much anxiety is trying to control so much in your life.This ruins relationships. I'm in love with a free spirit, we've been dating and figuring things out for 8 years now. When she leaves to get space it kills me, but we both know it's from me getting too controlling. When you do this it's tough cause it will drive people away. And even tho you're well-meaning and trying to help it almost push her into the arms of another man who seemed less stressful and controlling. It sucked, I subscribed here and had daydreams of shooting myself. But time passed and she was faithful and I promised to work on not being controlling, but I realized something new to me while I was in that phase: Suicide is the ultimate, desperate method of trying to get control. It's getting the final word in so you can control other people's thoughts. The idea, at least to me, always was ""that will make her wish she had appreciated me"". But the important reality is that it is actually just the fastest way to make her forget you. You will not go down as a hero and her heart will move on. Ironically suicide is a short term solution. Instead you could take the tough, long road of  learning to be okay without the comfort of control. And that's going to have a much bigger impact on her life. She will never forget that, and you have a fighting chance of actually being the easy going guy she knows you can be. Then you can be happy and a teammate to her, and the anxiety will move right through you. I hope this helps someone that may be feeling like I was. Thanks for readingTL;DR: Suicide for control is a short term solution. "
How to cope?,Ive lost a baby a few years ago very unsupportive partner was never here emotionally. Have tried to work things out with him but things always turn to shit between us he never put me first he ran off on me most of our time together. Im so sad over the baby and losing him on top of that. I know he isn't worth it but I feel like he should be feeling how I am. I feel like since the baby was a part of us both being with him makes it hurt less now that he's gone I feel so sad alone and like the baby meant nothing to him. Ive been overdosing on painkillers every night just trying to end it all im lashing out at him for hurting me and I just cant get the anger out of my head. He has already moved on and couldn't care less about me how can I get through this? I just don't want to see him out with his new girl as it will just kill me inside even more.
Not Sure It Will Ever Go Away..,"Since I was 14, I've had issues with suicide and depression. A lot of that stems from my childhood, not the best, but maybe a story for later. Anyways, highschool was bad, but after highschool was worse. I didn't really have the social support structure that I needed. I'm 28 now, I still have my battles, but it doesn't feel as bad as it once did. Part of me believes that we'll never truly be 100% healed. I still like to think there's hope though. I will say, that after fighting the fight for so long, it does become tiring. Almost to the point in which youre ready to throw in the towel. Once you get over that hill, fighting the fight, is simpler. You can suppress it alot easier. It's still hard though. Occasionally I'll have a suicidal thought, but not as frequently as I once did. I have hope. "
I'm just tired. It's long past time for me to go.,"My whole life has been little more than sadness misery and pain. I have no hope that it'll be any better tomorrow. Only worse. My mind is broken from untreatable mental illness. My body is breaking down from stress, perpetual suffering, and my crummy job. My soul is long gone. Everyday is bad. Alone. Isolated. Just waiting for my pitiful excuse for an existence to end. I'm tired. I'm just plain tired. Life was never meant for me. I would have been better off having never been conceived. . It's time for me to leave this world. Leave this life at last. I already have a method in mind. All it needs now is its final preparations. I think I'm ready."
Constant physical pain. I just want it to end.,"I have a disease called interstitial cystitis. It's a bladder disease that makes you feel like you have a constant UTI except there's no infection and no cure. I'm in constant pain every second of the day. I've tried every treatment that five different doctors have thrown at me and nothing has helped. I have to stick to an incredibly limited diet or the pain becomes excruciating (anything that tastes good is off limits. Nothing but really bland meats and grains and vegetables. No seasoning, most fruit is bad, no chocolate, no coffee, no alcohol, no acidic food of any kind. Acid is basically what gives food flavor). I can't have sex because it makes the pain worse and that part of my body always hurts. At what point does life just not become worth living? I feel like I've hit that point. I wish assisted suicide for chronic pain was legal in the US. I would try to do it myself but I'm too afraid of failing. "
I feel like I'm drowning,"I just got rejected after my fourth job interview. I've been searching and unemployed for a month. Stuck in a house with emotionally abusive and controlling parents. Desperate to make some money and leave, but I can't.I dont know what I even want out of life anymore. I have no aspirations, and my self confidence is completely shot. I have no friends either, never have, never will. I really dont want to kill myself because I am too scared. I also think I still love my parents and my brother (who constantly berates me and blames me for arguing with my parents, instead of being completely obedient like him) and dont think I can do this to them by taking my own life. But the longer I live, the more I see no way out of this pain. I sometimes think I was just meant to eventually do it, cuz I am a waste of effort and resources on my parents. Maybe I'm too stupid to realize that yet.
Anyways thank you all for listening"
I really need help but dont know what to do,"I was suicidal in high school, went through therapy, got pilled up and felt worse for it. All they made me feel was numb and alone at the same time. I felt like a third person, watching myself live life. When I went away to college, I started feeling better. I met a girl that showed me happiness was possible, and it was the first time in my life I felt genuinely loved by someone because of who I was as an individual, and not because of relation. That joy was fleeting though, shortly after being together the depression came back. but i wasn't suicidal anymore. flash forward years later and the suicidal tendencies and thoughts crept back into my head. Two months ago, she realized she couldn't deal with it anymore after 4/5 years together and broke up with me. Now I feel all alone.  The only person that could pull me out of my worst spots is gone. She was also the one that would push me to do something with myself when I felt helpless, and would try as hard as possible to make me happy, even if it was just for a moment. She was my best friend and my lover in one. I always told her she was the best thing that ever happened to me and would try as hard as I could to make her feel appreciated. But now weeks after our breakup, I still keep in contact with her, but she said she only ever feels sad when she sees me. That, coupled with the rumors I hear about what she's doing nowadays hurts, so I don't know if talking to her is a good idea anymore. I love her still, and I feel my best talking to her, but I can't bear the impact I have on her and how I feel afterward. She isn't the source of the depression, nor is she the source of these tendencies I have. I just felt like sharing that because now I don't know who I can lean on and what to do for myself. I want to get better, but I fear that it's too late for me. I really just want someone to talk to and lean on.  I've been so panicky, anxious, stressed and lonely, what freaks me out the most is that thinking about suicide is the only thing that relaxes me. It helps me stop thinking about what's wrong in my life and how I feel. It's the only way I fall asleep at night. Please help reddit, any advice is more than welcome, and feel free to PM me  "
Fukt,"When I was 8 years old, I chewed a pen cap to
the point of sharpness and carved ""fukt"" on my knuckles. I should have known then what I ultimately know now. There is nothing in this world for a 'person' like me. I'm a narcissist, a loner, a complete asshole, a sad tune. I've been a professional cook for the past 14 years of my life. Which makes sense. I would have never thought I would have the job I have now, but the mere thought of walking into chaos and disarray five days a week bums me out even more than breathing does. Sure, kitchen work is the only work I know. I should be appreciative of making the most money I have ever made. I'm not. Recently, me and my girlfriend have been going through a rough patch. I calmly talked to her about how she needs to help with bills, rent, and other things for our apartment. I added that she has been very cold towards me, which I attributed to her grieving process of a lost co-worker in December. Previously mentioned, I'm no saint. I spew smartassed comments like a broken hose. I need my personal time. I like to play guitar until all hours of the night. You would have thought being together for 3 years, she would have tried to get her act together.Alas, 3 days later she turns and says something to me that I can't stop thinking about: ""I've been thinking about our conversation on Monday. You're right. But, I can't give you what you deserve. I'm going to move back in with my parents. My brother is on his way to help pack everything up. He's 15 minutes away."" What a load of garbage. I was a gentleman. Honestly, I was. I calmly started gathering her things and loading them into her and her brothers car. At this moment, as calm as I was, I knew my old suicidal feelings were starting to muster inside of me. She said we would talk soon. I didn't believe her. I went back into my dusty apartment and laid on my bed. I had the thought that I never wanted to see her again after the way she walked away from me. I quickly got up, went to the computer, and deleted every picture and post that we  ever shared on every social media outlet. I blocked her, her friends and her family members. I didn't want reminded of this person who I loved so very deeply.It scares me that I didn't cry. We are on talking terms now, but leaving the way she did hurt me in a place I've never been hurt before. I told her that. She agreed we needed to talk. I explained how I felt in great detail. I told her I didn't know if I could trust her ever again after the way she left. If a person chooses to abandon you for asking for help in basic life situations, I'm pretty sure they will leave you just as quickly if something serious happens. She wants to work things out. I don't know if I can get over the massive breach of trust and a knee-jerk reaction to leave me in the dust. This isn't the first time I battled with ending my own life. 4 years ago, I ate a ton of Vicodin and sleeping pills combined with a half bottle of Jameson. Waking up from that was terrifying. You can't move your arms or legs as fast as you want. It's a pretty surreal feeling. I remember thinking, ""I bet two more vicodin would have done it."" She would pick me up from work every day. I don't drive. I have a depth perception problem and doctors have repeatedly informed me I am ""physically unable to drive."" And I believe them. The problem is pretty bad. But, now that I have an hour and 45 minute bus ride home after getting my dick kicked in all day at work, it just makes me feel even more shitty. I don't drive. I don't care for work. The woman I loved with all of my heart left me in the lurch. I don't have the strength to carry on any longer. At 29 years of age, I was supposed to be over feeling this way. I was supposed to be happy and generally healthy. I'm not. I just want everything to stop. I want the thoughts to stop. I want to stop being confused. I want to stop feeling like this is the end. And I can't. I can't see the road ahead. I can't see a future worth living for. I can't see a love worth living for. I can't stop thinking about how I'm going to end my life. I still haven't shed a single tear. And I feel like that says more than I ever could to myself. "
Im back,I have no effort for life and haven't for six years. I'm done.
Please Help :)/ :(,"I'm really fucking depressed. I'm so depressed I think I've lost my own sanity because I don't know what emotion to feel, happiness or sadness. I see these horrible things and I just wish I had the money/power to make it right, but what's a 16 year old kid to do with no car or money. I'm pretty smart I'd like to think, but that doesn't get me anywhere. Every human I've ever come in contact with misunderstands me and I just can't take this anymore I really need help."
Anyone know where to buy seconal? If I had it I would kill myself.,same :( horrible feeling to want to go so bad
My premature aging is pushing me closer to suicide,"I'm barely 23 and I have recently developed nasolabial wrinkles which are becoming even more noticeable each day.  Everyone around me has mentioned them. In addition to this,  my eyes are becoming crinkley and my entire face is sagging like I'm 45.
Literally a year ago,  I was being  mistaken for a 13 year old and now suddenly I've aged 20 years in a matter of months because of a serious depressive episode.  I lost my job and I've been contemplating the actual end of my life.  I've been playing around with it by cutting myself super deeply for the last 5 months.  I'm all scarred up.  Maybe it's vain,  but I'm already not great in the looks department,  so this is a huge blow and honestly IDK how to go on with my life with everything that has happened and now with my face.
I have a trip to go on to visit my sister in early October,  and as soon as I get home I think I'm just going to end it.  "
idk what to do anymore,"Sorry for the long post, I just typed what came to mind..
I�۪m currently 23 and a half years old, living in the Netherlands. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with High sensitivity and depression. Things that happen hit harder and stick longer in my brain, both positively and negatively. Mostly the negative things though.. since my 16th birthday I�۪ve had a psychologist(I know right, lovely birthday present), until last year, when I thought I had my life under control, but apparently I�۪ve just hit rock bottom.
When I was 15, I had my first girlfriend. She had some problems of her own, but I didn�۪t think much about it because at that time I was busier with getting bullied and sitting behind my computer playing video games. Couple of months later she moved in with me and my mother. I don�۪t really know the reason anymore, but there were some problems at her home. It seemed like a good idea, and it was kind of enjoyable for the first couple of weeks. We shared a room, and you know, were teenagers raging with hormones. After the said couple of weeks, I kind of lost interest in the sexual things, but still loved her nonetheless. She began to change, waking me up with sex while I didn�۪t feel like it, but I couldn�۪t say anything about it, because I thought it was normal. My daily life consisted of waking up, playing video games, going to school, coming back home and eating dinner, crawl behind the computer, chit chat with my ex, talking/watching tv if she wanted to do something, or almost fall asleep behind the computer and go to bed. Occasionally someone that I knew messaged me, or dragged me out of the house to get something to drink. The owner of the caf̩ she took me to knew my family, so sometimes he would give me a couple of beers, got a little out of my shell, and went back home again. Every time I started talking to my ex that I wasn�۪t feeling very happy, and that I needed time for myself, she threatened to commit suicide. So I kept quiet. My ex began to change again, more sex, I couldn�۪t talk to people anymore, she even got pissed at me when I talked to other people, or even my mom. Didn�۪t really know how to deal with it all around that time, but I kind of held onto her annoyances, and got annoyed as well due to my high sensitivity. People around me couldn�۪t see it, but it was chipping away on the inside. Bullying continued at school, and even at home I wouldn�۪t feel comfortable anymore. Months later I snapped, and ended up in some youth prison. I blacked out, broke a couple of windows, and screamed at people, and threatened my sister and my mother when it all happened. When I try to remember it all again, it�۪s all foggy and I get a massive headache. Even to this day. After a couple of weeks in youth prison, I decided I had to get rid of my ex, because she was negatively impacting my life. I didn�۪t care about her life anymore, because I needed to fix my stuff first if I wanted to continue living. She agreed, packed her stuff, and two days later had a new boyfriend. I got over it, but my daily life continued with gaming, school, and my court-assigned psychologist. I discovered that I was depressed, didn�۪t see life in colors. I couldn�۪t care less about the people around me, and didn�۪t even feel a connection with my family members. No bond or anything. As far as I was concerned, I was living with strangers. I got anti-depressants after the first couple of talks, and the dosage increased more and more after every couple of talks. I had no will to live, no reason to be alive. I was just a small dot on a piece of paper. After a lot of talks, I kinda felt better. I was getting good at some videogames, and even ended up having a LAN party and actually winning. It felt really good to achieve something, even though it felt I wasn�۪t even ���that�۪ good. I felt as if my team won, and I was unnecessary. I still put on a happy face for my team, and the pictures that were getting taken, but it wasn�۪t me that helped the team to the first place, it was the other four.
I started studying application developer, not really having any clue why, but it made me sit behind a computer the entire day and I learned new things, so I couldn�۪t complain. It was a 4 year course, but in my second year, I lost interest and motivation again. Every teacher and fellow student told me I breezed through the classes, and I could pick up things in an incredible pace. But I couldn�۪t get out of bed, never hungry or felt the need to eat, and I�۪d cry myself to sleep for some reason. I was still unhappy. My psychologist called the school, and talked to their therapist to set up a meeting with me, to talk me through my issues so I could get my motivation back and continue, because I was already halfway. It didn�۪t work out, and I re-did my 2nd year. No luck, felt even worse, didn�۪t make it. My school talked me into downgrading the level, so instead of an application developer, I started studying to become an IT guy. All my older classmates finished school, and I barely made it through the entry-level course. I started doing different kinds of work to get money. Slowly things looked a little brighter, I had money, I could do things myself. I wasn�۪t that much dependent on my mother and step-dad anymore. And I even got lighter anti-depressants.
I met a girl on someone else�۪s birthday party a couple of months later, and when I was intoxicated enough, we made out and started hanging out. We had a good thing going, every weekend I went to her parents place to play videogames and talk about difficult things. She had a lower back hernia, and in secret I tried learning to give lower-back massages to people with hernias, to relieve their pain a little. But sadly I took over the negative trait of being to clingy from my previous ex, and destroyed the only good thing I had in life. I was devastated, back to square minus 50. I started getting suicidal and they upped my meds again. Tried committing suicide 4 times, and even when I almost jumped in front of a train, someone pulled me off. And not because he was a good person, but because he didn�۪t want to be late for work. Talk about a finishing blow..
I went back to focusing on work and getting money, and years later I met someone else at the same job. In that year my meds were taken away, and I could handle it on my own. We started dating, and the talks with my psychologist ended. It felt natural and trusting, so I ended up opening up to her. Couple months later we had our own place, and she became my reason and motivation to work 5 days a week, and earn money to provide. A month ago we had our 1 year anniversary. Last week, I had 2 more hours to go at work, and I received a text saying she took all her stuff and she was gone. She didn�۪t feel anything for me anymore, and that she was sorry.
I�۪m home alone now for a week, over the years I learned to be composed and to calm myself. But I�۪m cracking open and I don�۪t know what to do anymore, I�۪m at the end of my train of througts. Videogames, sports, or music don�۪t keep my mind off my depression anymore, and I�۪m losing it. I don�۪t know what to do or where to go, but I know the depression just climbed all the way back and everything around me is back to grey. I�۪m trying to put my mask on, to continue working, but I can�۪t anymore. I need advice��_"
Im in constant physical pain from stress (PTSD),"Actually CPTSDI have tried everything but the physical pain is so overwhelming. It always comes back no matter what. It permeates my arms, legs, face, neck, torso, everything. Every cell in my body is usually in so much pain. I can't handle it anymore.What's more is I have constantly been psychologically fucked up for the nearly 21 years of my life. I have never known happiness or togetherness with people who value me. I have no idea what that is like. I don't know what love is. I can't keep going. I have so much pain in me and there's no solution"
I don't believe that doctors actually want to help.,"If they did, they would help people like me, the ones who are truly lost, end their suffering.  would be helpful."
The world doesn�۪t have anything to offer me.,"Life is entirely meaningless if you have to spend it entirely alone. I had a 6-year relationship fall apart last year because of my severe depression. I just kinda let him walk away, because I thought our relationship (which was co-dependent and often involved his emotional and sometimes physical abuse of me) was destructive and could never make me happy like it used to. And for a while I was relieved to be without him and hopeful for the future. I met someone new and started this promising new relationship that didn�۪t replicate any of the problems of the last one and was happier and more productive than I had been in years. I was sure I�۪d made the right decision and that I�۪d gone through hell in that last relationship just to meet this new guy. Six weeks ago he walked away too, dumping me with a text message and claiming it didn�۪t ���feel right�۪ to him. He must have realised how worthless and intrinsically unlovable I am. I�۪m simply ineligible for relationships. I�۪m too ugly (���no you�۪re not,�۝ everyone says and yes I fucking am. I�۪ll preemptively cut off that derailing by giving you proof: ) and broken. My long-term ex has moved on to a fantastic, fulfilling relationship and I�۪m stranded alone forever (and consumed with jealousy that he gets to be happy). So who was the defective one in that relationship? The guy who immediately meets a new girlfriend or the girl who gets dumped again and spends the next 50 years completely alone. And I will be alone. This is also not up for debate: because I�۪m a 2/10, because I�۪m shit at dating because I spent most of my 20s in a long-term relationship and have BPD (so I�۪m either immediately infatuated with someone or don�۪t give a fuck about him���there�۪s no in between) and because the only person I�۪m attracted to is my recent ex, because I�۪m highly disposable, because no one who had a choice would ever choose me I don�۪t even choose me. There are a few things in my life outsiders would think are good (I own a flat, I live in a great city, I�۪m reasonably successful) but I�۪ve realised it�۪s all meaningless if you can�۪t share it. If you�۪ve been exiled from the world of love and companionship and forced to watch everyone enjoy the things you don�۪t deserve. And I have to know that it�۪s all my fault���because I wasn�۪t content in my long-term relationship, because I had the hubris to think that I deserved better when really I was SO LUCKY anyone loved me, because I somehow managed to destroy my next relationship and transform his feelings for me into apathy (although I was so careful to make sure he never knew about my depression and TRIED SO HARD to be perfect and worthy of him), because I was born hideous.The world can�۪t offer me anything that even remotely compares to what I�۪ve lost. Therapy and medication (both of which I�۪m getting) cannot magically make me worthy of love, cannot bring people back into my life, cannot give me a future, cannot make me attractive. That�۪s all immutable and I can never be happy alone, not once I learned what I was missing. The only way out is to kill myself, but right now I�۪m too much of a coward to do it, too afraid of messing it up. And I really need to do it sooner rather than later, if only to spare my family and friends the misery and stress of dealing with me (my mother keeps telling me I�۪m going to give her a heart attack because of my various crises and hospitalisations). I sometimes can�۪t believe I have the gall to keep breathing, when I have been shown so many times that I�۪m just a burden on people, that people will never love me, that I will never again have a shred of happiness. I�۪ve stuck Post-in notes all over my house telling me to suck it up and do it, just endure a little pain for quiet and relief, but I�۪m still here, like a moron. Tl;dr: I�۪m too worthless and ugly to be loved and to be alive.  "
I want to die because of my parents but they're also the reason I haven't commited suicide yet (Long Post),"Throwaway obviously(19,M). Currently in tears while typing this. I feel like my parents would be so much better off without me. They say they love me but don't show that in actions. They seem to love my (older) brother much more even though they deny it. I've been saying it since I  was like 14 but they never wanted me to think that. I love them a lot and they are the most important thing I possess. Yet I feel like they don't love me at all. I always get to do the dirty work, boring things and always get shouted at. Meanwhile my brother is ""so perfect, such a great son"" which is what they say at family activities. They say (jokingly) that I'm like the kid who they've lost hope in. They have been saying that since I was like 12 and they always say it's a joke and nothing serious but it always haunted me. About myself, I have some good friends, not lonely, not ugly, not stupid, hopeless etc. I love being with my friends and most people would describe me as a nice guy who is happy. Nobody knows that I can't really remember the last time I was happy. It's like a 24/7 mask I wear pretending to be happy (partying, going out, hanging out). I just feel very useless time to time and I feel my friends and family would think I'd be the last person to end my life. I think most people at my school/city would think I'm very happy meanwhile my mental health is fucked up. I've been having suicidal thoughts for like 1,5 years now but I don't like the idea of shocking my loved one (friends and family) and never be able to see them anymore.Things went even worse when my dog passed away a few months ago. He was besides my human friends probably my best friend. Back when I was younger and didn't have many friends, he was always there. I miss him every day.I don't know what to do. I think I couldn't go through the process of physically killing myself but I also don't find much joy or happiness in my life. I wish I could just skip to being 65 and being retired. Nobody knows how I really feel and I have nobody I could ever talk about this because even that would shock the shit out of them as I have never ever shown this. I hope there is a way out besides killing myself.  "
Im feeling lost and have no clue what to do,"I'm 21.. and I don't know what to do anymore.
I used to have dreams, hobbies, happiness, goals and a purpose to keep trying for a better life. But now.. i don't.
I have a little problem with social skills... I don't know how to express my feelings into words, to communicate with the others, even just a normal conversation. I have been silent for too long that i almost forgot how to speak, even in my own mother language. I don't have any friends and i can't make new friends because i can't trust anyone and i'm really afraid... to say goodbye.
I used to not be like this... To be honest, i miss my old self.
I used to be a naughty, talkative, energetic kid because i want my mom attention, to be accepted and loved... and cause i also hate school. I've always felt marginalized, unwanted and inferior to my siblings... I envy them. Im not good at anything but i still want her to look at me and talk to me and hug me... We finally did, she finally looked at me and tried to understand what's inside my head. I was really happy till we found out she has cancer, stage 3. My father came back from nowhere after left us with debt,... to be with mom and help the hospital bills. Its still haunting me when she was crying in agony, begging to be dead and apologized for leaving her kids behind...
Im... dying. I shut down eveything, locked myself and tried to kill myself. My father is dating someone right after my mom died. He left the house, took my little brother with him. My mind is completely blank, I dont know what to think nor say. It just empty... It was bad at that time but i got over it and stood up, working on a new goal.
I went to college, multimedia art school. My father hate it and against me going to art school because he doesn't like my art. So I studied alot to get good grades to prove that he is wrong. I have had 3 jobs at once to earn more money for school and subsistence fee. I tried my best to make new friends and I met my first love in college. Things went well until shit happened... I've been betrayed by my first love, tricked by my co-workers and the clients didn't pay me. I got really sick and its keep getting worse ( I have lost more than 20kg due to sickness, stress and insomnia ). I have a fear of asking for help, but at that time i have no choice so i took all my brave to ask my family and friends for help... And they turned me down
I gave up... It's awful. My scores getting worse each day no matter how hard i tried. Everything just collapsed and i can't hold on anymore. I quit my jobs, dropped out of my school, locked myself again... I have started to sleep a lot, the longest is nearly 3 days and still feel tired and always tired... End up spent nearly a year just lying in bed, doing nothing!! I tried again. I went out and find a job that fit me and tried again. I found a new hobby, and spent all the money i have saved to learn tattooing. I really think it's going to work this time, but once again i failed. Im a fool, a failure... Im useless, worthless,, I cant do anything right or think properly. People are so selfish, mean, ungraceful, judgmental and deceivable!! They are terrifying me. Im so tired, of everything. I just want to meet my mom, hug her and go to sleep with her... forever.
Im tired, im good for nothing. I dont have any purpose to keep trying. Im afraid of going outside, talking to people. I have so many negative thoughts and it keep drowning me. I cant go out anymore. My art suck, no one like it!! Everyone is a liar. No matter how much i try, things will never change. I cant do anything, Im stuck... Father is going to sell my mom's house to pay the debt... I dont get along well with my siblings, family... I have tried too much, I pretend to be alright, always fake a smile so people stop asking and giving me more pressure. But now... I dont know what to do now... I dont even know what to think..."
Feel rediculous,I wrote my note today. Just for my friend. I need her to know she couldnt have saved me. This isnt her fault. She needs to be happy. To continue.
"Im trapped. I have to go to class in an hour, but I'm stuck on whether I should end it or not","I don't know what to do I'm shaking, I have work to do but I can't focus, I don't know what to do"
I'm honestly so lost.,"So i don't know what i should do anymore, I've attempted suicide before multiple times. Reaching out to my mom was the first thing i did after my first attempt failed, this was in middle school I called her told her what I did and she picked me up and i spent the night with her. I was living with my dad at the time since my parents were split. I'm not really sure what happen'd to cause me to become so suicidal and i might've forgotten at this point honestly but, its turned my life into a downward spiral. Once i entered middle school i completely started skipping class, i would sleep through them or skip. This continued until once again at the end of my middle school life i attempted suicide. This was the first time i had to be hospitalized for it and once again i asked for help and ended up at a therapist. Talking to him I lied constantly lied, lied, and lied. This was well how i was raised by my mom. I don't know if she was embarrassed of me or what but, when she got remarried she had me constantly lie to the guy. This started up even more once i started high school.I have 2 siblings one older and one younger sister. Their treatment is 200x better than me, throughout my freshman year of high school I always slept on the floor in our house we had a spare room but my mom made me sleep on the floor still i really don't know why. My older sister would let me sleep in her bed sometimes but not always. In my second year i got a laptop this is when i started playing games to keep my mind of suicide i honestly couldn't take my life at this point. I would constantly read books from the library during class resulting in extremely poor grades but, i didn't care to me I always felt worthless anyways only my 2 sisters were meant to be anything i was always going to be trash. My mom would make sure to always compare me to my older sister i hated it so much but, always i would bottle it up never say anything. My second year of high school i dropped out. Since then I've done everything i could to just find something interesting to keep myself happy even the smallest thing. Whenever my mom tells me something I'd just bottle it up and turn away. I've only ever gotten angry and yelled twice once in elementary and another last week when i just couldn't take it anymore.My mother constantly has me lying to friends and family telling them im in college or doing well i can't take this anymore i don't even know if i can try to pick up my life at this point. I honestly am just thinking of grabbing the gun in our house and ending it all. I've never had any friends to talk to the only person i could talk to was my mother and she didn't help when i reached out to her. I just don't know what to do anymore."
Can I talk with someone?,Sorry for ask this but unfortunately I have no one to talk about this. I just want to clarify somethings before commit suicide.
Fetish about death/ Suicidal but not depressed,"Someone please help me diagnose/understand myself better.When I was young, I remember being constantly suicidal. Back then it was definitely due to depression growing up. I was a younger sibling who felt like my parents would only love/care for my older sibling and didn't like me much. They had us at a young age (early 20's) and she was a prodigy/excelled at school and everything she did while I was didn't even speak until I was 5 (i understood language but intentionally didn't verbally communicate) so they thought I was mentally slow. If an argument ensued between me and my sister, then regardless of whoever is right they would take her side and scold me. It was obvious to
everyone that they wished my sister was the guy due to hyper-traditional values and only kept me around the house because I was the one born with a penis.Then I'm not sure exactly when but somewhere in late elementary-middle school the beating started. I was physically disciplined and scolded before (apparently they hit me since I was 1) but I'm talking about beatings. I don't think I had it as bad as some others for it was never done under alcoholic/substance rage by my father and I never felt my life threatened but damn those were not pretty days. He'll call the school to say that I won't be coming in the next day and go at it. His courtesy was allowing me to wear long pants before the session began, put me in a push up position and beat me with either a hockey stick, wooden baseball bat or a golf practice club(sometimes he'd let me choose). These sessions weren't too often but more often than not, it would go on until I wasn't able to walk for the next following days. Sometimes I was actually guilty of what he was accusing, but sometimes I wasn't and that drove me mad for no amount of pleading and reasoning worked with him. It's also why I don't blame my mother as much. She was MARRIED to him, I can only imagine. (But he never laid a single finger on my mother or sister). But countless days went by with me on the floor crying like a maniac, envisioning the day that he would die.Then there was the eating disorder. This mostly had to do with my self-confidence I suppose but I became bulimic around then as well and threw up after every meal. It wasn't because I didn't like food- trust me it was pretty much the only thing that kept me alive. In fact I remember loving eating so much that I thought ""I live to eat"" and literally only threw up just so I could eat more, kinda like how the Romans used to do. But all this made me really overweight and I reached 210pounds by the end of 8th grade. But throughout all the time I hated being fat. My family made fun of me in public, I knew I didn't look good and would grab on my flabby stomach and cry in the shower.So this was around when (late elementary- around 9th grade) I was definitely depressed and suicidal everyday. I didn't know I was depressed back then because I simply didn't grasp the concept but it was bad. Where I was didn't have guns so I'd always grab a kitchen knife when everyone was asleep and tried cutting myself here and there but throughout all the years no matter how desperately suicidal I was, I could never muster the courage to actually slit my wrists deep enough. I was a freaking coward and I even hated myself more for that. The one thing I could actually have control over- I was too much of a fucking coward to pull through. I remember wishing if we were still in the States, without a doubt this was already over with with a gun. This went on for years, on a daily basis and I think that's when it became a part of me.Fast forwarding to the present- I am an excellent student at an well established university. I excel at both my studies and at my workplace that my future definitely looks bright, despite the current political and economic madness. During high school the abuse continued and intensified and my parents marriage fell apart but I found sports that I excelled in, lost all my weight and had a great social life, finally finding a life for myself out of my house.But when I reached adulthood I noticed that I has a love for knives. I love the way they feel, how it's built, how a right one feels so cozy and right against my hands. Holding onto it definitely helps me sleep. And I have no motivation to... live? More like I don't really care what happens, but I wish I died. Not because I'm depressed (it does come sometimes every now and then but haven't really had one since 2015) but for reasons I don't quite understand. Maybe it's because I've come to accept that life is mostly going to be filled with shittier moments than not, maybe it's the frustration with the human race and all the injustice of the world, Maybe I'm just bored or tired.
But I believe that death is the ultimate liberator. As we are chained on this world in a cycle of pain-temporary pleasures-grieves and sin, death is what sets us free. I often imagine/feel it as a long-separated lover that I long to embrace. Her kiss would set me free.
I think about death like how a star-crossed lover thinks about their significant other. Maybe today will be the day, or perhaps I must wait longer. If you read all of that, I truly thank you. It was long and you probably didn't need that in your life but I am curious and honestly somewhat concerned about my case (I know it's not normal, if anything).
Any type of psycho-evaluation is welcomed. "
Alone.,Someone talk to me? Just talk. I just wanna let everything out
I woke up and contemplated whether to give up today.,"I am thinking about breaking up with my SO (our relationship is failing because of me and my drinking.), I want to write out notes, voice messages for some close friends and family. Also go through my stuff to see which I am going to give away, which to destroy and which to be left untouched. Clean up my room and try to keep it as tidy as possible.Preparations are going to take awhile. But having my dream, the constant fucking suicidal thoughts, the self destructive habits, ruining everything around me, burning bridges and fucking my entire life up, it all makes me think I've Had Enough. "
Thinking about clocking out.,I've ruined my life already. Lost my first job out of college because of this depression. Went unemployed for a year before landing a warehouse job. Felt suicidal during that whole time. Only a week into this job and I have a sick feeling in my stomach before even going into work. I'm broke and can't afford to quit. I know this feeling always comes back to me and there's nothing I can do. Thinking about finally giving up. I can't take feeling like this anymore.
Help. I can't move. My next move is either suicide or revelation. I don't want to keep going,"I can't get these suicidal thoughts out of my head, I have been sleeping all day just to cancel it out, I don't want to hurt my family. If my family weren't in the way I would have ended myself years ago. I have college and stuff on my chest too but it's so hard to focus. Am I not fit for society? I am in physical pain from being so fucking depressed"
too much.,I can't break through your world cause you live in shades of cool. your heart is unbreakable. i'm too young. i'm fragile. what can you overdose on? what is the easiest way to die.
I am crying and feel like killing myself. I get punished for being able to do things. I get punished for not being able to do things.,"I was just diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum in July and I'm 24 years old. I grew up with an abusive and neglectful mother. Now I live with my father and he is wonderful. However, I can count on one hand the number of people who care about me. (Hint: it's 2) I can't find any help because for 1, apparently no one knows wtf autism is for some reason, even in mental health facilities, 2, it is assumed I should have gotten this help long ago. That part is true, but not my fault. While applying for medicaid disability, I was told that because I didn't have any accommodations as a child, I would most likely be denied. I was so stressed and upset all throughout high school that I took an hour out of class every day to cry in the restroom. That teacher didn't know what was up with me, but he had a heart. I was physically ill all the time from stress and remember breaking down in front of students and teachers in class claiming that I didn't understand how I could finish the work in time and why no one else struggled. I was always told it would be worth it to graduate. Six years later and the misery I endured there was most certainly not worth it. Nothing in my life has been worth it. People are cruel and impossible. "
Am I crazy,Everything just seems so fake and empty. I wonder what is really out there. I have no point wondering with no answers to my questions. I just feel so insane and weird and people see me as crazy when i see them as stupid and boring. I know it sound big headed but its just the way i feel. I have a girlfriend and am 15 years of age so im hoping shit will look up for me. But most of my dreams have already been crushed by the shock of reality. And it crushes me...

You ever feel hollow?,Everyday
Glad I didn't throw away my suicide note,I don't think I could handle writing another right now
Was about to kill myself but realized it was probably going to be a slow death so I stopped,"I was in my bed, re-thinking everything wrong with me and my current lifestyle. I was looking up ways to kill myself without making it seem like I did it on google when this thought passed through my head. What if I just suffocate myself to death with a pillow? That way, there's maybe the chance that everyone was going to take that as me dying because I fell asleep on a weird position. So I put my head on the pillow, started breathing and just waited. I was running out of air when I stopped. I assume I inhaled some carbon dioxide, seeing as I started breathing heavily when I pulled out. I guess I couldn't wait that much, would've been a very slow death. This just happened. I don't know what to do or think right now. I'm probably going to waste the rest of the night crying myself to sleep while eating garbage or smth.Edit: Idk if I should call this an attempt? But I guess I'll have to talk about this to my therapist. Wonder what she'll say  "
Hey. I need help to find a good way to die.,"DO NOT TRY TO TELL: Everything Will Be OK...

Hey hit me up! I'm looking for someone to talk to!,I might fall asleep shortly but I'd be happy to keep you company. What's been bothering you to make you want to post here?
I need to talk to someone,I don't mind talking. I'm just a random butt btw. Not a specialist of any knid
I don't think I'm going to kill myself tomorrow.,"What I want to happen will never happen, if I make myself die because I want it so badly.

Can't think of a title,I'm really on a low place and feel my life is useless and I feel the least I can do right now/I want to do right now is to lend a hear if someone needs or help someone in anyway I'm useful.

I don't have a choice,"But to set this flat on fire and kill myself.They'll cut my electricity off in a day or two,can't pay the whole bill for the life of me!Can't find 16 bucks for the last one either.I'm done,I'm done,I'm so done!!!That fucker that tortured my mother to pay off her debt is now doing it to me,giving me two,soon to be one,wekk to pay off ALL her debt!I can't get free law support in time.I got no choice.Life,with or without job will be hell!!!"
How can a depressed person help another depressed person?,"I need help, this last weekend my boyfriend and I had some LSD pappers. He had an O.D. and a hysterical collapse. He became something else and broke down our hole appartment, he took off his clothes and started to scream nonsense opened the door, ran through the hallway, and jumped the 3rd floor window... I thought it was over. But fortunately, he fell into the 2nd floor roof and only suffered a few bruises. He's ok now, as good as possible, but I find myself in a complicated situation, I am clinically depressed and bipolar,  and we both had attempted to suicide before. He's unemployed since february, and very unhappy in college. At this point, I don't now what to say to him, we live alone here in Brasil, and there is no hope for us here. We're trying to move to Europe, but everything's so hard for him. Since his father died he has no strength to move on. And even doing everything that I can, I am unable to keep him up for long. We're in psychiatric treatment, but even so, it hasn't been enough.So I'm here to ask you guys, if you have any idea about what to do for now one, what habits can we adopt to get through it.  Thank you! :)

I'm so lonely. I feel like I have no one.,"I shouldn't feel that way though. Yes, I may have broken up with my fiance about a month ago...but it was for good reason. He began getting abusive again. I stood up for myself the first time. I had promised him when he got back together with me that if he had ever laid a hand on me again, I'd leave. He did good for nine months, and we just so happened to drink for the first time and it all went to complete shit. I should feel happy for sticking up for myself. I should feel happy for admitting that I deserve better. But what if I don't deserve better? What if he's right, that he really will be the person who loved me the most and I'm just going to be alone for the rest of my life? He was the only person who I liked that actually liked me back for once. I've always gotten rejected or used for sex and just...maybe that's all I'm good for. I'm so fucking disgusting. I'm weak. I'm just a fucking stupid, crazy, fat, ugly bitch who's never going to fucking go anywhere in life. I'm going to die alone. Everyone says oh, ""you're going places. you're going to change lives. you're gonna be this. you're gonna be that. i can feel it."" I know I'm not though. I just think the world hates me, and that's why my 10 + attempts haven't worked. Or maybe I'm even stupider than I think and I'm too stupid to kill myself. Who knows? I dunno, man. I just wanna stay high. I wanna talk to someone though. I don't like being alone. I miss taking care of someone. It made me feel worth it. I'm just so down.

Completely Pointless,"Tomorrow I'm going to jump off the New River Gorge Bridge in West Virginia. Life is completely pointless. I realized this 4 years ago in 9th grade science class when I was finally freed from my brainwashing, very religious mother and the private Christian school I went to for the rest of my life. The difference between my actual intelligence and my ""social intelligence"" (non-verbal iq) is over 30 iq points. I never had any friends and everyone who's known me has always talked to me in the same condescending way you talk to your friend's eight year old son. My family doesn't give a shit about me. My dad used to relieve his anger on me and my sister after work when we were young. It didn't usually get physical because I would timidly accept his rage and make myself feel visibly ashamed. My mom cried because she felt threatened by his abuse, not because we were damaged by it.
My sister was/is completely narcissistic and took a sadistic joy in hurting me whenever she could, and if I ever fought back or if our parents overheard us bickering it would usually come back to me. The dynamic changed completely a couple years ago when my family realized I was suicidal. My mom actually got emotional because of me, and my dad stopped being an asshole. My sister's still sociopathic/narcissistic. My parents are worried about the social repercussions my death would have on them.During that time I missed most of my highschool, though I got my GED. Despite demonstrating an aptitude for academia in the top 1% of the average senior class (via GED benchmark/simulated comparison) I still have the communication skills of a five year old, and I know I'll never be able to harness my potential, which isn't even that great in the grand scheme of things when you consider the billions of people alive, not that it matters anyways... I guess I'm somewhat thankful for the trauma I endured at home and school, otherwise i may have never been deadened to the point of being self aware. There's no point to life. Time is endless and our years are limited, societies rise and fall for no ultimate reason, and humanity is progressing towards nothing. Our perception is only an illusion of the chemical reactions that grant it, and I can't stand the agony of knowing the pointless of my own existence. I have no friends, only my parents will be directly impacted by my absence. And why should I care about them when they're the reason my life has been so miserable? The notion that you get to decide whether other people live or die is completely selfish anyways. I know people often say that suicide is a selfish act, but the reality is that imposing an unbearably miserable life on someone else for your own satisfaction is selfish.I'll always be an outcast to society and there's no point in contributing when I only get scorn in return. But really none of what I said matters anyways. TL;DR, life is pointless, and so is this post. Tomorrow I'm going to kill myself. Good night. "
I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it,No. You are too strong and believe in hope to actually isolate yourself and so it.
Im not exactly suicidal but I probably will be if I dont seek help soon. What type of person should I talk to? Some details about me inside,Ill try to be quickLate 20s Short guy 5'5 Was fat whole life until recently got in shapeWas raised extremely religious Jewish - completely left faith but havent told parents yet.Never had a girlfriend before ever because of weight and religious barriers. Cant even start to talk to girls like a normal person because of so many years without interaction. I dont even know if I can marry a jewish girl and fake being jewish. So Im fucked both ways.Have a worthless business degree but now back in school to go for my dream of being a surgeon.Recently got menieres disease which has completely disrupted my life and taken away my freedom and joy. Its a disease that causes frequent and long bouts of vertigo without rhyme or reason. No cure. I would never wish this on my worst enemy. Also have a rare skin cancer that is being treated but will have to deal with lifelong repercussions and side effects. Trying to get into medical school but these medical issues are just destroying my physical and mental health. I cant get a good study schedule going because of the medical problems. My dream is dying. I rapidly got into a depression and really am starting to consider suicide in the near future. My life is pretty much going downhill.
I'm ending myself in the basement when my parents go to sleep tonight,"I just can't take my parents anymore. I've been depressed for 5 years due to being heavily abused by another family, and my parents just don't take me seriously. I think I've done everything in the book to try to get them to notice and talk to me, but instead they laugh and say I bitch too much.I've also tried to take matters into my own hands and walk 3 miles to the local mental health facility, to find out their doors were locked and no one willing to let me in. (I know the facility doesn't have rave reviews, but seriously - so much for proclaimed 24/7, right?)I don't have any friends irl or online, dropped out of high school so I can't talk to anyone there, and of course my family doesn't want to jack shit.I have everything ready and my parents are in the living room watching a movie. I've fed my cats one last time, and I think I'm ready to go."
Is it normal to be envious of someone who just committed suicide?,"I don't think I'm your typical depressed person. Or maybe I am and just don't realize it. I've been very depressed since I was about 16, I'm now 25. I don't have the support system I wish I did and I don't have the money for a therapist. I drink, smoke weed, and take prescription pills to cope.(I don't buy these things my boyfriend does and I just take them because I'm the worst person on the planet) So I guess I'll start with the reasons I think I'm so depressed. When I was 16 I had what I thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents. Until the day my dad left my mom. It was totally unwarranted. I even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke. NOT A JOKE. Fast forward to now. I found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years. My mom knew nothing. My parents ""friends"" decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final. Being sixteen and going through that was hell for me. I remember trying to cut myself but I was too scared to cut too deep. All I ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist. Real edgy. Anyways, so I've also been in love with someone for eh 9 years. The problem being this person lives in a different country. He had no intention of moving to the states(can't say I blame him). And to be honest if I were to move there I don't think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently . He tells me loves me from time to time but that's easy to say when you know you'll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that. So just about every year-two years I skip from relationship to relationship. I think So I don't get attached. I dk but it's really hard on me mentally and it's even harder because I don't truly understand why I do it.Okay so fast forward to last December. I found out I was pregnant. It was a weird feeling. I was so overjoyed I think because I thought it would give me purpose. I had just started a new job and didn't want to tell them immediately so I hid it from them. It was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though. One morning I woke up at 3am with horrible cramps. I didn't fall back asleep. I was getting up and around for work at 6 and I was spotting so I called into work. I told them I thought it was an ovarian cyst. When I got to the hospital everyone was really nice(I think they already knew what was going on). Fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours. I found out that the fetus inside me was dead. Who knows how long I had been carrying that thing inside of me dead. They gave me my options and I told them I would think about them, make a few calls to my insurance provider, and let them know tomorrow. They sent me on my way. At 6pm that night I had a miscarriage in my bed. It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced . Now I'm pretty traumatized. I mentally can't have sex anymore and it's been putting a huge strain on my relationship.So, I bought a gun. My boyfriend thinks it's because I want to practice shooting. The real reason I bought it was because I figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself. The problem is i'm not afraid of death. I could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now. The other problem is that I am an empath and I know killing myself would hurt a lot of people. It's not their fault they don't understand how much pain I'm in. I've tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe I should get some help. Well it's really fucking difficult to get help when I'm barely paying my car payment, car insurance, phone bill, and rent. Plus gas for the hour to and from work ride I have m-f. So I guess I should explain how my title is involved. A few days ago I found out someone I graduated high school with committed suicide. My family has known his family forever but we weren't ever really friends. I found myself crying all day long over this person I was never friends with. I realized I was crying because I was envious. I wanted the courage he had to go through with it. I really don't want to be here anymore but I don't know how to turn my conscience off to go though with it.I don't know what to do anymore. All I think about is killing myself. I want it so bad. I don't know if I'll ever have the balls to do it or not. But thanks for reading anyways. And if anyone has any advice or anything to share I'd love to hear it."
I'm Not a Person,"As long as I can remember I've felt less valuable than other people. I mean, I work hard, I'm good to people and extremely apathetic. I'm always aware that my actions affect other people and do my best to keep that influence a positive one. It has never made any difference. Since childhood, I've never one a popularity contest. I've rarely been singularly invited to things by non relatives. I didn't start dating til college and I always get discarded and permanently ignored by the girl and all our mutual friends. I'm so alone and worthless and I don't see any reason why I shouldn't just drink this gallon of bleach and call it quits. No one has ever loved me and they never will. Even when I think they are, they won't be. I don't want to live in a world like that."
I think I'm ready to go... but I'm too scared to really do it,"First off, I'd like to acknowledge that my problems are probably quite insignificant when compared to others that come to this board. I should be happy. I'm 18 (whole life ahead of me, right?), I come from a wealthy family, I got the chance to grow up abroad, I attend a fairly decent college in the US, I'm not disabled mentally or physically, I have a family that cares about me, I don't have an identity (sexual, gender, etc.) that might distance me from my peers, I'm not physically unattractive (or so I've been told, I dunno), but I think I'm done with life. Also, I'd like to apologize for the damn-near essay that follows. What else would you expect from a humanities major?I've felt this way for a long time, but I'll skip most of that time period and start in high school. Throughout the majority of high school, I never really had any friends, which is entirely my fault. Towards the end I made a couple of close-ish friends, but they're gone now. Plus, I think they were only there because they knew how unhappy I was. I think I only really made it to college alive because I was really fairly dependent on alcohol in the months leading up to me coming here. But now (in college, of all places), that crutch is gone. So far, I have absolutely no friends in college. I have absolutely no one I can talk to. Every time I've even slightly mentioned anything about my emotional state, people get scared and run off. I've been fairly reliant on my friends from high school to talk to, but I am almost certain that they've tired of me. Well, I'm absolutely sure one of them has, and she was the only one that really mattered to me. Now, I just lie to everyone and tell them that I'm ok. I'm not. I've tried to hang myself twice before, but both times I panicked right before I lost consciousness. I've overdosed on my meds (which I've stopped taking) three times. It was Zoloft, so I knew it wouldn't  be fatal. I've got a noose hidden in my room. I've put it around my neck a couple times already and tested if the knot will hold. I just need one more thing to push me over the edge. I can't help but feel that the rest of my life has nothing in it really. I know that some of my thoughts (which, because of their complete lack of reason, I won't go into) are just the depression talking, but I know that I'm not going to be cut out for anything great. No girl will ever find me as a viable option romantically (have you ever had a girl give you the ""yeah...no thanks"" look?) so I know I'm going to end up alone, or in some passionless relationship in which my supposed partner will have decided to just settle for less. If you can't tell based on the lack of structure in this paragraph, I'm not even sure what point I'm trying to get at anymore. I just know I don't want to be here. I'm sorry to waste your time, if any of you bothered to read this far.    "
Why doesn't anyone help me?,Why do they let me rot?
Thinking of ending it but not doing it.....,"Thinking of ending it but not doing it, not cause I have reason to live. I'm just shit scared of doing it. No matter what I do every year I'm getting closer to the day when I would be done with this life.
I wish something happened naturally to end my life. no pain or suffering."
contemplating more and more everyday.. know i need help but don�۪t have anyone to talk to.,"senior year has just started, i spent the summer completely alone because my friends that i�۪ve had my whole life have grown up to be bullies and druggies/alcoholics. i perceive myself as someone who is better than that so i pushes them away, but this summer was too hard so i made amends.. some days are better than others but sometimes they can all be SUCH dicks.. & i know you�۪re thinking ���just make new friends�۝ but really i don�۪t know how and it�۪s senior year i�۪m not going to be seeing anymore of these people soon anyway.. not wanting the friends i have really fucks me up upstairs.i�۪ve grown up a larger kid, but since i started drinking with my friends almost a year ago now i�۪ve been gaining weight much more rapidly. i can only get into the mindset every once in a while but i loose motivation quickly. i�۪m 260 now and over the summer i�۪ve ���grown�۝ stretch marks. i feel absolutely disgusting and even than doesn�۪t want me to lose it. i try as much as i can to be healthy but i always forget and as i�۪m chowin�۪ down i remember and say fuck it. not looking healthy as i should i believe has always kept me from a girlfriend. i�۪ve had a few flings i guess, but after the girl decides it�۪s over (every time) i realize she was just using me for a tool wether it�۪s money or someone to get affection from. i strongly feel that everyone around me or knows me feels like they can use me as a tool but i would prefer to help someone get something they need rather than stand up for myself. i�۪ve been told i�۪m a very nice person, almost too nice. and i see it, but like i said, i would rather make someone else�۪s day even if it fucks me over in the end. that�۪s why i also think my 4 flings haven�۪t ended up in a relationship or anything past 2nd base. i think loneliness fucks me up too. the final thing i will list is my home/family situation. parents divorced at 4. it was agreed that each parent would get 50/50. we switched houses every two days. i think that having two homes alone can fuck you up, but switching every two days? fuck that. i have a sister who�۪s two years younger, and we did it together. we always liked our mom more, she was love-able and provided a much more fun & laid back living situation, but she was stern when she needed to be. my dad was more strict, but fun in the early years. my dad has anger issues and is an alcoholic and likes to yell, especially when he�۪s upset. but we grew up with it. my dad got remarried in 2013 and i disliked her, but was afraid to tell him as that is mean to say/backlash from that statement. but now all she does is order us around, tries to control everything including my mom, and is generally bitchy (even my dad thinks so). it�۪s gotten to the point where i don�۪t talk to her and my dad is too much of an asshole to me and my sister that i can stand. so over the summer i stayed with just my mom (my dad didn�۪t care because my mom is closer in town) and my mom couldn�۪t pay for it. she filed a thing to take a look at the child support payment which has been the same since the divorce. this friday it was my dads weekend but i didn�۪t want to go out there because i�۪m tired of it, so i ignored them until about noon when my dad called my mom and told her to tell me to talk to them, i didn�۪t. eventually my stepmom blew up at my mom which wasn�۪t right she has nothing to do with this situation. i finally told my mom that i want to live with her full time. after that my dad showed up and we had a long conversation about it all & i felt like shit because we were all fighting and we shouldn�۪t have to in the first place, and i wouldn�۪t want my son to do what i did to him. he was mad about my mom wanting money and seems like that was the only reason he wanted me to stay out there with him. he didn�۪t confirm that i could stay with her but he didn�۪t say no. long story long i really hate myself about the whole situation and it�۪s sad. among other things i bottle my emotions up and can�۪t handle my stress. i�۪m over apologetic. i�۪ve had a literal headache since 2015. im only mediocre at things in life, and feel i�۪m getting more dumb everyday. i get made fun of by almost everyone and most days i feel like no one actually cares. i have reached out to others about this but they literally don�۪t care. i don�۪t wanna live past graduation. don�۪t know what i would do. i�۪ve been thinking of a way i want to do it and just haven�۪t decided. i don�۪t know what to do and i had no one to talk to. sorry this is all over the place i was trying to think of everything and this definitely isn�۪t everything.. just the most important to me."

tired as hell,"fuck, i posted here almost a month ago and i'm embarrassed that i'm back here again, feeling even worse than last time. but i pretty much don't have anyone anymore.my life is so fucking messy and i really don't think anything's getting better. i tried killing myself last night and i'm trying again tonight. i have literally no reason to live anymore and i don't know why i can't just...do it. i'm surrounded by my closest friends but i can't even talk to them about it cause they don't care. my best friend has been ignoring me and he was my only reason to live until i realized he doesn't care.i have so many reasons to end my life and no reason to stay. i probably just might kill myself hours after making this post i don't even know anymore."
Why can't I just let go?,"What is it about existence that is so important? If every day is so painful and there's no way to change that, why can't I just opt out? What is it about giving up that is so awful you can't even say the word ""suicide"" without feeling that stigma in the air?Why is it that I want to help every other suicidal person I see, and beg them to live, but I can't apply the same philosophy to myself?Why can't I just...not be here? What's so bad about it?"
I went on vacation to escape problems and got worse ones,"I flew out of state to visit my best friend and check on her well being. I figured it would also be a good time to work things out with my ex girlfriend. Finally, and naturally, I wanted to spend some time with my family. I just wanted to take a break from my already horrible life, and so I flew out here. Long story short... my mother and my best friend end up fighting through me. My best friend has to leave me in the middle of the night.  We haven't been able to spend as much time together. My mother is upset that I'm still her friend because she thinks I'm too naive and trusting. And my ex just cut me off completely and is frustrated with me because she's 4 hours away and I can't see her and she feels like we can be friends because of our feelings for each other. To be honest... I'm not thinking straight. I feel like I lost so much in 2 days. I wanna run to the end of a bottle of bourbon and stare into the ceiling... and I tried. I woke up and everything was amplified... I have never felt closer to the edge than ever before. I look in the mirror and can't recognize my reflection. So I'm staring at the ceiling listening to me & my best friend's sleeping radio station. Shot of bourbon in my system. I need a friend. I'm scared and sad."
I think I've had my breaking point.,"I've always thought about suicide and thought about how easy it would be to just not exist and when I thought about it it always makes me so scared and emotional but now I'm at peace and I'm calm. I think it's because I'm ready. I think i may actually have to courage now to go through with it. I guess I just kept hoping that eventually I would make friends and people would care about me but I'm a shitty person and people don't like me or care about me. I try to hard to make friends but I can't get anyone to stay because of how annoying I am I guess. My own boyfriend I can't confide in because when I do he doesn't want to deal with my pity party and that I get annoying when I hate on myself. If I can't confide in my own boyfriend, my one friend, who can I. Not to mention he's been ""cheating"" on me, flirting with this other girl, sending nudes, telling her how much he wants her. Makes me feel pretty worthless and unimportant and i already felt that way to start.I feel alone. The most alone I ever felt. Even in High school when I was bullied I had friends. And now, nothing. Writing this is cathartic but I think it's mostly because I think I'll skip The Who goodbyes and suicide note thing. The last thing I need is to be baker acted. I just want it done. I'm stuck at the hospital I work at in Florida because of the hurricane so idk how I can go through with it. I just wish that I had been good enough for someone. Anyone. "
I'll do it,"Last time was as close as possible to jump but this time I won't reach out to someone who isn't there. This time I won't be held back by knowing that they'd feel guilty this time I will just do it. I've seen before how people react and I know that they can stand it.
Before tomorrow morning I'll be gone"
"I know no one will probably read this, but I made a post on r/depression saying I'd kill myself tonight...still thinking of tying the noose but not there yet","Still there's no one I can call...all my ""friends"" have helped me...I have unread messages on facebook - people who haven't spoken to me in a while asking me if I'm okay...not going to reply because I don't want to lie. Abusive mother after me and I don't know what to do...don't want to get better, not after trying so many years and failing...all I have is regret so I wish I had the courage to go, but it's probably not going to be tonight. All I can say is there's a lot of valium in my room and I'm thinking of doing it in my sleep. I just want it to be painless, that's the only way I can think to go. "
How do I help?,"Hey guys I'm just wondering how can I help a friend,  after multiple attempts at suicide a friend of mine nearly succeeded.  Thankfully by the grace of whatever you believe in he survived but is in the hospital in critical condition with a long road of surgeries, rehabilitation and recovery ahead of him. I've know this guy about 13 years but after him moving countries then back again we haven't been super close just occasionally hanging out. His depression is well known along with his alcoholism and has still denied he had a problem when I've tried to reach out to him.  Without going into details of what happened I do think he may still want to live and I'd like to do my best to help him in anyway I can. Please if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
Military instead of suicide,Has anyone ever thought of this or have gone into the military instead of choosing suicide? I dont agree with war or much of why we go into it but I know its not going anywhere. Just wondering if anyone has done this or thought of it because I see it as a reasonable choice
"People who say ""Talk to somebody"" don't understand most of us think we can't or don't have somebody to begin with.",Title.
It's morning.,"I just wanted to rant for a momentI want really badly to be more suicidal than I am... I feel very overwhelmed in the sense that I feel this badly/don't feel like I have anyone to talk to, to the point where I would post here, but I still don't think I have merited it. I don't feel like I deserve an outlet. Social media isn't fun for me anymore because its just anxiety inducing. I don't talk to my friends-- friends I have never bothered to hang out with because I am afraid. I am never comfortable. I'm not comfortable outside my house, but when you get down to it, how much potential do I have to feel secure if I am scared and overwhelmed lying in bed, with McDonald's hashbrowns en route.I feel disgusting! Its been a kind of crescendoing feeling that now feels like a shrieking sadness. I despise even the way I articulate and speak and write because it feels wrong... Either in the sense that it feels disingenuous, or that its too raw, too eager, in a cringey, pathetic kind of way. I haven't made any progress in therapy, but its my fault! I don't have anyone to talk to about being depressed or anxious because its so steeped in self loathing and suicidal thoughts, and that scares my parents! It makes people angry because they don't understand how I could hate myself, but its so deeply ingrained in everything I do. I'm not good enough, I'm too much. I'm pathetic and avoiding. I am not the adult I should be.....not the person I should be. I hate feeling revolting, but more than that I hate the way this repels people. I can't validate myself...... But complements/reassurance from others means nothing to me. I'm too anxious to call my therapist. I'm tempted to email, but I'm so disgusted with myself for being weak and pathetic.Being depressed I can talk about... Anxiety is hard, because its harder to pin down why I feel the way I do. Self loathing is just a no go, for me, because its like a knife... people don't understand.Sorry for being morose... I feel like when I let things boil over, venting does more harm than good... I think its just because I'm tired. I'm having a Moment, but I'll be fine, I think. I hope you all have a nice day."

Family troubles,"Hi, I am a young man being 17 and almost 18 who still lives with his parents, I've never not had what I want from them and they have always been generous in giving me things but I have always been at their beck and call since before I could remember.  Their strictness has been in my social life in that I would get invited to events by my friends and be restricted to go nearly every time, but yet when I confront them I get the average answer of ""if you had just asked"" or ""I would have let you go if you were more polite in asking"" to the point I have started to think I am a naturally mean and despicable person. Soon after the start of high school I became an extremely introverted person, not speaking often and usually only to people I was comfortable with my true feeling, no one but my best friend has ever had empathy for me in this kind of situation.  I am constantly blamed for things I am presumed to do at home even when setting down a box I will be accused of slamming it to the ground, if there is a broken piece in the box I will be punished even if I had not broken it.  The struck policy of my grades also put a sense of 'not being up to par' also, for college my parents laid out colleges that I would and would not be allowed to go to, money is not a factor in this since they are quite well off.  I've never had any sense of choice in my life rather I feel like I've only ever been constantly ordered around and directed.  That's came to a boiling point today, through my troubles I've always been given one way out and that's been through my connections on the internet and being able to talk to people who I believe genuinely find me interesting and accept me no matter my flaws, laugh with me, and feel excitement with me.  Yet no more than 45 minutes ago this was also snatched from me,  I was accused of becoming a reckless and violent person to their belongings inside this home, having bought my entire computer and hard ware with money I've alone earned from working when ever I have time I watched as it was take away from me due to the fact that if it's in their house, they own it and that includes me.  My one escape was taken from me, I've never felt truly loved by them and seen as some sort of item to show off, like a medal since bit was expected I take any class that puts me above people be if I wanted to or not as well if I thought I could pass it or not, if I did not comply I would receive punishment.   I feel like an object and over time all objects breakdown to dust, I can't tell if I'm a spoiled brat that's just venting their frustrations to people with even worse problems if I could be considered to have problems yet when I lost my last social freedom I can't handle it.   I ask of 2 things
1, after my words am I just a spoiled brat talking about first world problems to people with actual problems or am I being put down againstAnd
2, how do I fix my self -thank you for reading this, even with out any notification as to if you did I will be happy to know some one was interested in my story, it's all over the place but please bear with it."
Sensations in wrist.,It's like my body is telling me to end it.
No hope at all,"All I want to do right now is jump out of a window. It's the only way I can end my misery. I feel like no one is there to talk to me. In my dorm hall, I knocked on some friends' doors and they weren't there. I texted one friend asking her if she wanted to go to dinner with me and she never responded. My college has no open parties and I never get invited to any. No one texts me asking me if I want to talk or hang out. I cry all the time because no one wants me, and whenever I cry, I make sure nobody hears me. Not because I fear I'll get attention, but because I fear no one will care. I cut myself in the shower a few days ago. What gets me even more than the people who never talk to me are the ones that reach out to me once, then disappear. Like that one friend I texted. In the year and a half I've been diagnosed with depression, I tried everything. I was hospitalized three times, went to counseling once a week, and took three different kinds of antidepressant meds plus two mood stabilizers. Nothing ever worked. The only way I can ever feel better is to be accepted like everybody else or die, and I'm sure the former will never happen. I was told that a death on campus would affect the entire community, yeah fucking right. If I get ignored in life, why would I not get ignored in death?"
I have a plan.,"It's not soon, unless you consider next year soon. A plan to end my life because I don't really see a point anymore. I've peaked at the ripe age of 19 and I know nothing else will come of my life. I'm horribly lonely and it can't be solved, and I know I will only proceed to get more and more lonely. I don't want to continue struggling with not being able to sleep, with crying day in and day out, with feeling trapped in my own head. Next year, after I've secretly made my peace with the few people I actually care about I will kill myself without allowing anyone to stand in my way. It's for the best, if not for the people around me, at least it is for me. "
Close to the edge,"Two weeks ago I was so close to killing myself, I had the razor go my wrist, and now I'm thinking how surreal it would be for me to not be here, my mom would be alone and heartbroken, my sister would get extremely depressed, etc.
But I can't shake the feeling I need to die, I go to sleep with death on my mind and wake up the same way, my will to live is getting chopped at slowly, to the point small things set me off.
Hopefully I can distract myself with 8 hours of mind numbing nonsense, 2 hours of solving rubiks cubes and self loathing, and two hours of anime.Only pleasures I have in life, I'm afraid they won't be there for much longer.""also if anyone here had massive amounts of disposable income can you send me 500 dollars for a Nintendo switch, thank"""

I feel so lost,"I'm in my second year of college doing stuff that I absolutely hate. My life seems like it's spiraling out of control. I don't want to be here, but I don't know where I do want to be. I'm not ""good"" at anything, and everyone I talk to about leave my college basically says I have to be here by default. I don't want to kill myself, I have things I want to do in life, but it never feels like I'll be able to do any of them because I'm not good  enough. It seems like the simplest thing to do would just be putting a shotgun in my mouth and ending everything. I feel so trapped and lost and alone.

I continuously drank straight Kraken on a whim until I couldn't stay up just hoping I wouldn't see today. I'm going through a lot of shit. Shit that's been plaguing me most of my adult life. The people that raised me are all dead or moved away. Friendships are fleeting and a relationship is impossible. The love of my life doesn't love me back and no one else compares. I've been severely depressed for nearly 20 years and I have no motivation to help myself. I started self-harming recently and that helps my mind some but doesn't do my body any favors.I had a bad day Thursday and when I have a bad day, it takes me about a week to get over it. It gets worse before it gets better and like a wound, the danger ends up being the infection over the wound itself. I remember waking up on my keyboard and at some point I moved to the living room while waiting for a text from the girl mentioned before and didn't wake up until morning. I don't drink a lot normally so that without any food made my tolerance pretty low. I'm not really sure why I'm putting this here. I don't expect help nor do I want advice. I had a stupid moment and just wanted to share I guess. It's easy for me to accept death these days because I look at it like, I could die now or I could die later. The only difference is age. That's how it will end no matter what and I'm only getting older every day."
I just want to be euthanized,"I'm trans. The world is flooded and burning at the same time, the government is actively trying to make our lives impossible, and I have severe dysphoria about my body that I can't fix. I'm too depressed to move. The people around me are just irritated by my suffering. I wish someone could make me comfortable and help me die in my sleep."
Why is my reflection so painful?,"Sometimes I refuse to look in the mirror for days because I hate what I see. It's not that I just hate my body, which I do though, it's just that...I can't look at what I think I am. No one wants to hire me. I've never been in a relationship because I never think I'm good enough, I don't have anything to offer the world, and I'm just a skinny little white boy who can't show his feelings to the world or else he looks like a ""pussy."" I can never text or talk to people because I always think they're seeing me in a negative light because of what I said or did. I have friends but I never feel like I'm a part of any group. I'm a senior in college and am afraid of everything after I graduate, whether I'll be alone for the rest of my life and have no friends or love. These are only some of the thoughts that come into my head when I look at that reflection. It's too painful to look, and I'm afraid of that one thought that keeps hiding in the corner waiting to come out. It sometimes jumps out and scares, but then goes back after a few hours and I can breathe a sigh of relief. It still doesn't go away though. I'm terrified of what could happen if it decides to latch on. Then again, life is too painful and I hate my own reflection."
My boyfriend shot himself,"After 9 months of up's and downs my boyfriend shot himself i had no social media i didn't talk to no one and i quit my job for him and my 8 year old daughter had no contact with her dad just so we could be happy and so we could form that family that my daughter and me always wanted. He had face book instagram whatsapp his friends his job where females work too and he also had contact with his ex for the fact they have a little girl together and i didn't mine cause i trusted him but he didn't trust me at all and his family members and his girlfriend talked trash about me and he believed them soon i came pregnant with my second child it was the happiest day for me cause i thought we gonna be good his going to change but it didn't happen his trust issues where always their i didn't now what else to do to make him happy or to be ok with him i try everything i could but nothing work he didn't trust me at all on april of this year he punch me in the face for not having facebook that's crazy right  and it wasn't the first time he had hit me and everyone thinks im stupid for loving someone like him... Well after that day we argue most of the time and it was all the time cause of his trust issues he thought that i could cheat on him with every guy that past by or that every guy wanted with me he had no trust in any guy i felt like shit i mean I'd try everything to have a good relationship with him but nothing work i even told him that he shouldn't blame me for the life he had with his ex's that i was nothing like them and he reply all girls are the same no one is faithful no more well on may he left to his mom's house cause it was impossible being ok with him we agree in getting back together after the baby was born we decided the best for the baby but we still argue trough text all because his ex girlfriend didn't like and she talked so much trash about me and he believed everything she said i told him if he believed everything they talked about me that i would leave him alone that all i wanted was for him to be happy it didn't matter with who but i just wanted his happiness.. In july 24 after being all weekend together and being happy planing in getting marry in having 3 more kids after the baby was born and after he buying our babys car seat he shot himself im not sure why he did it he texted me but i ignore that message he on that day he hit me and broke my nose he left me bleeding and all because of his trust issues so i ignore that message he send then 30 min later his sister called they were looking for him they where worry after i told them what happen they started calling him i saw the message he send me and it said """"im saying goodbye forever im sorry for being the worst for not trusting you im leaving this miserable world loving you now take care""""  i texted him back told him to not do something stupid out of anger but no reply i started calling him but no answer then i got another message it was a picture of the gun he said """"let my baby know that im sorry for leaving him alone that I'll be watching over him from where ever i find myself i just don't want no one to cry for me and that's it i came to remember when i gave you your first kiss take care and bye to this miserable world.. """""" i called him many times i grab my moms keys and drove to that place but i didn't found him i was like thank god his ok when i was heading back home i spotted his car so i headed back and park behind him when i open his door he had the gun in his lap ot seem like if he was sleeping when i moved him he had already shot himself in the head i told him what have you done my love i called 911 but they told me that when i got to him it was already late that they were sorry my lost i felt like dying i couldn't stop crying i just wanted to die with him and right now the only thing that is holding me from not doing something stupid is my unborn baby i don't know what's going to happen with me after my babys is born honestly i just feel like dying  "
I'm feeling ill and it's getting worse for each day,"Hi, I guess... I don't know how to do this. I posted in depression but maybe I should've posted here...?I've been depressed for nearly 6 years now, and you know it has been worse (suicidal) and slightly better. There was a time for a couple months I thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again. And I can't realy blame myself, I wasn't worth enough to have such feelings. I don't think I ever was.So I guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it. And one of my firends when we were out at a pub, he's been my friend for like 12 years now, he said about my father ""I can understand why he remaried with someone with children, cause he knew he'd fucked up with you and wanted to try/start over again"". And I guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and I infront of the TV or computer. Though my mother wasn't that good either she put me infront of a book (good, made me scary litterate as a kid) but she always had a bad temper. Like a hellish scream I never heard before. And she's very controlling. So that wasn't that great either. Both had to work alot to get things going for them so I guess I didn't really spend that much quality time with my family. So I waited for my time to leave and then moved out, and today I try to never visit home because I always feel bad when I'm there.And I have been kinda suicidal lately. I remember someone asked me if I was ok and only slept bad. I kinda then proceeded to do as I always do and push those asking away. I don't want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how I feel but I think it's not right. I think I will try and talk with her about something but I don't know how to ask...How should I bring it up that I want to talk about something? Should I do that? Won't they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing? Worse than to be surprised than me taking my life, and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything. Is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts? Especially since you meet them and word could spread?I wish I could cry in front of someone and be hugged. I wish I could talk to my friend and tell her how I feel and that I need someone to talk to, but I'm not quite sure she could take it or help me. Is it ok to talk to someone? Is it ok to share what I feel like, looking for some sort of comfort? Can I find comfort in this by talking or will I just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again, can I risk talking to anyone about this? Is it right of me to press something on someone, is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what I am feeling and my suicidal thoughts?"
I feel like I'm losing emotion and I don't know why.,"I don't think I'm going to commit suicide, or anything. But after reading a lot and watching this Sub for almost a year (on a diff acc) I figured this was the best place to ask this Question.  In fact I've been meaning to post something for a while.  I became 23 today. And I've realized that I've accomplished very little in my life. I'm unemployed atm (Trying to get a city job but waiting for a call), I'm single and have been a long time. And I still haven't had my first time. I'm probably a selfish brat, because I feel like I'm lucky to be where I am, after reading how hard people have it here. I probably don't deserve to ask this question, or feel the way I feel. But I needed to ask someone this. Anyone but people I know.  Compared to people in my life, I'm very unsuccessful. I don't think I'll go far, and I'll always be below everyone else. I was mocked and teased a lot by people I called close friends since highschool, and even by my ex love interest who I dated for 5 years total. They told me I'd go nowhere, not go places compared to them. I feel like no matter what happens, I'm below them and that the life I will live will be unhappy.  In fact, I already feel like I'm not even what I used to be.  My dog died earlier this year. I had him for his entire 13 year life. And I wasn't sad at his death. I felt nothing. Whenever I see my friends, a lot of the time I forget about my shitty position for maybe an hour, but then thoughts of my mediocrity sets back in. I don't recall the last time I was genuinly happy. Whenever I'm alone, I just think about what a weight off my chest death would be, but then I think about how said my friends/family might be. I happen to be a pretty good actor, so I don't ever let me family or my friends see how I truly am or feel.  They could never know. I can't let anyone know I have a problem, I don't want them to worry about me.  The thoughts of suicide based on the fear of my shitty future and loveless life have lingered me for maybe the last 6 years. But I could never do it. I have some people who really care about me, and to think of such a thing I feel is much too selfish. But I want to be happy like I used to be... What do I do to feel something again?  Thank you all for any advice."
Dead in life,"Why can't I just scape from my reality? Just take one more they said, the pills are not making any effect. You're just extremely happy, I wish you could see my heart because behind my smile there is just a deep pain, how can I heal my pain? No one can't see I'm just dead alive? Can you bury me alive so I will rest forever? Can you hear my thoughts? Can you even see me? Can you even feel me? I'm just another person, another particle. What if I die today? Would you even notice it? I am just an irrelevant being in world that is bigger than my strength. Why am I so alone? What is the sense of being in a world when you're just insignificant for everyone else? How can I break the bars around your heart? Why can't you see me? Why can't you love me? I just can't leave you!! Will you see me die? Why can't you help me when I scream? Where were you when I needed you the most? I am so alone! Just help me to die. I am invisible for everyone. I'm so empty inside, I can't even feel my own pain. Would you care? "
I don't want to live to be 18,"My life's just not worth it ... nobody even cares about me. I hate my birthday, I don't want to be alive to celebrate another year of misery "
y'all ever have self-hatred days?,"not feeding yourself, not bathing yourself, not doing anything at all. I like to abuse substances, mainly alcohol and weed, but really anything I can get my hands on. just get messed up and hate myself for the day..."
Its creeping closer,"Before my suicide attempts in the past I would feel a sort of physical cold emptiness or numbness. These would last for weeks maybe but that's when I knew I would end up trying again and I am feeling this again. Everything is dismal and my future is very bleak and unhappy. I feel mental torture daily and I cannot escape. My trauma makes things worse and I get set off by the simplest of things slightly associated with it, as simple as the word. I feel like I am screaming inside of my head. I fantasize about pain and wounds that would kill me. I know I'll probably attempt suicide and hopefully die in the upcoming weeks."
I feel empty and blinded by my past (long post).,"Hello I'm a Junior in high school who has social problems, so I suffer from severe shyness,and social anxiety due to me being introverted. Even when I get picked on/ also in class and I still talk my body still feels so shaky, and I fucked up in Piano Class I was trying to play Rock Along. My hands were full of sweat yesterday and it was noticeable that my voice was shaking. Anytime, I raise my hand my heart beats so when the teacher isn't looking I put it down. I'm too shy to ask for help and embarrassed by this. Same for my Math class, my mom was right ""If you have questions, then ask the teacher and don't come home clueless about the math HW."" I suffer from a bad past. I got bullied in middle school and 5th and 6th grade for having dandruff. In middle school I told through counselor and she just gave the bully, what you may ask was the consequence? Only 2 lunch detentions and ironically that counselor was bullying me about ""(My name) if you have bad grades, i'm going to call your parents."" Then, I told her that it was not right embarrassing me in front of my friends. She started crying and saying ""I'm sry."" I gave her a 2nd chance and she refused to change my classes and said go talk to the principal :/. I literally even avoided to swear at her and that was attempting. I hope I never run into that bad counselor Ms. Dukes ever again. I'm so glad I left that school to high school, that bullying is not much a problem to me compared to in middle school. Also, my 8th grade English teacher humiliated me and saying that ""You have an F in my class. Gotta fix that F."" I mean, I understand that I have a bad grade, but doesn't mean you can freaking embarrass me in front of the class. Then, I told the principal and he said he ""was sry."" The next week, he said the N word and then said ""(my name) Hope this doesn't offend you, don't call your parents."" He laughed like a complete idiot and don't understand why he hasn't been divorced yet. Someone in 6th grade asked me about this word and then I answered it in the way that it means. Then, he proceeds to say ""Eww, gross."" He spreads the rumor about me in my class, and in this program W.I.N we have every morning, my friends won't sit by me anymore and I literally cried. The principal assigned lunch seats and I just sat there quietly and was a loner. This boy was bothering me in the lunch line, luckily I got him to back off since a teacher was there. He almost beat me up in the bathroom but I defended myself and fell, but I was okay. He ran away like a coward. After winter break, I started to be cool with them and told them not to believe that kind of stuff. I will never miss elementary school and middle school. I don't know how to find the scale factor of 2 shapes.  I can't fucking take it anymore, and when I was younger, I would always slap myself on the side of my cheeks for being an idiot. Sometimes, I still do. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my head.I'm selfish I care what others think of me.In 6th grade, someone choked me and couldn't almost breathe for a minute was painful. I spilled soap on my sister's face because I'm a fucking idiot who does bad stuff and the wrong thing.. Then, I couldn't breathe again for a bit. I feel like i talk about myself too much and just am stupid. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not there at a place and just zone out for some reason. Why bother to feel live if there's not much hope? I keep stressing myself out and procrastinating a lot. I always had a thought of torturing myself with a pillow."
I wish I could die in my sleep.,I can't stop thinking of dying/suicide. I wake up angry in the morning because I'm still here. No one takes me serious because I'm a pussy. I can't actually do it which just makes things worse. I don't have cancer or any terminal illness (that I know of) but I feel completely miserable. I'm stuck and there's nothing I can do about it. I wish I could just get it over with.
When I was 11 I wanted it to end,"I remember when I was 11 school was hell, I remember not having any friends and feeling so alone all the time. I remember sitting up in bed for hours and hours one night talking myself down from stabbing myself in the stomach and just letting it bleed.And honestly I don't think I'll ever feel more guilty for anything than I feel when I remember that the only reason I didn't do it was because I told myself things like ''you're better than that.'' and ""it's the cowards way out."" And I don't know how to say it strongly enough that I am so so sorry for when i believed that to be true.At some point between then and now I actually had friends, I was happier than 11 year old me could've ever expected, for once I liked me and it was great I guess. But over the last year I lost almost everyone, they just stopped wanting to be a part of my life. I feel all alone once again and I'm so scared of going back to feeling how I used to feel and being who I used to be. I've been slipping for months and I don't know if I'd be able to talk myself out of it. Honestly I think about death almost every day, and as fucked up as it is I can't help but fantasise about being shot or stabbed or something. "
I'm currently talking to an internet friend who has been searching for pull to kill himself,Pls help me what do I say to him he is 15 and worried that he's not making a difference to anyone so he should just kill himslef
"Coped for years, nearly at breaking point","My first post on here, I promise you I'm not a troll, I just need to ventI'm 20. Had severe acne on face and back for years, stress on the word severe. Face is discoloured and has scars, back is covered in huge holes and keloid/hypertrophic scars left by acne. Tried so much to heal the scars nothing works. No point me even trying to get a girlfriend because when she sees me with my shirt of she'll probably vomit/be traumatised. Leg broke playing rugby in my final school year, had to get an operation and was bedridden for months, led to weight gain due to no exercise and couldn't study due to discomfort/pain. I couldn't catch up with the work I missed, got terrible grades, kicked out of school now I'm unemployed and havn't had a job that lasted more than 5 months in 6 years and I'm still living with my parents. I've had OCD for all my life and it got worse with more stress and now I can't even sit down for 5 minutes without it rearing it's ugly head again and again. I'm a virgin and I have only a few buddies left that I only see a couple of times a year. I tried to stay strong for years but now I'm at the point where I cry most nights and have contemplated ending it all but I can't do it so I just exist day to day waiting until I can sleep so I forget who I am for 8 hours. I don't even know what to do anymore. Thanks for your time"
I am ready to die.,"I've ruined not only mine but the person who meant the most in the world to me's lives.I can't fix this. I can't have my only chance at happiness back, ever.I plan on taking as many muscle relaxers as it takes to make my heart stop beating."
How do I get myself to get out of bed in the morning?,"I've been severely depressed since April. I attempted suicide on April 29th. I have five college classes to finish work for--they are incomplete classes from a few previous terms. I don't have to go to classes, I just have papers to write. I haven't made any progress in May, June, July, August or the days into September. I have until November 1st to do the work. I've been paralyzed, especially in the last month. I spend most of the day in bed. When I'm not in bed/sleeping, all I do is stare into space and worry about what a mess my life is/how much I don't want to live. I don't have insurance, so there's no professional help available or medication. I don't get along with my family and don't have any friends, so there's no one I can talk to. I'm completely empty. I have no desire to live or motivation to work. I don't care about doing the work, I don't have a sense of obligation to get it done or anything. I can't conjure a sense of urgency to do it or create rewards or consequences for myself. Everything is just awful. I don't know what to do to get myself to care about this work or want to live or anything. Every time I go to sleep I hope I hope I don't wake up. "

Could someonr remain Anynomous with the Suicide Prevention Line,I started hinking about this and how its a common thing people try to do. Im curious as to if the United States Suicide Prevention Line would allow you to remain anynomous rather its from The actual line or the Online Chat
"Shit, should I do it?","We don't know what's out there.
I'm tired as fuck because of all of this
But in the end we're all gonna die alone
I keep bouncing between the (everyone will be hurt because of it) to the (fuck it I'm miserable, no one matters, existence doesn't matter we're just like animals but with extra steps) ideology and it's killing me.
Animals die everyday
I'm an animal, can I die today? Where will I go, what will become of me, will anything in the afterlife be affected by this, do any of these people, relationship or not matter? I've been told dozens of times that if it came down to it, and it was me or them, they'd save themself, so fuck it? Right??
Fuck the hotlines, fuck the medicine, fuck school, fuck these sociopathic and self destructive tendencies I got from my mom and dad, I'm ready to off myself, but i mean.. shit man I can't help but feel bad about it."
Heavy Suicidal Ideation,"Have tried once this year through drinking myself stupid but my friends ended up calling the police. Lied my way out of it and they let me out that night. Felt like crap for a good week, understandably. I haven't really felt that upset since but my thoughts keep drifting to suicide, thinking about pretty graphic scenarios. I don't know what to do because every time I've tried to get help everyone makes a big deal out of it and I always feel worse.
I'm studying to become a high school science teacher which I really want to do but due to my lack of energy just am not doing too well (still passing). Last time I tried medication it worked for a bit but slowly stopped. I haven't tried another one for above reasons.
I used to write to help but just don't have the motivation. Even all my music reminds me of stupid and cringeworthy crap I've done. I swear I'm pushing my friends away even though they say I'm not. I think my family is ashamed of me.
I just don't know what to do, and my thoughts keep drifting..."
i just wanna disappear,"i just moved into my own place in a new town, far away from my family and former friends. i barely know anybody here, and i can't stop thinking about how easy it would be to just disappear. i could just end it all and i would never have to feel like this again. nobody would ever have to worry about me again. all the pain and confusion would be over. not just for me, but for everyone i know. there would finally be peace.it'd be so easy to just end it. and staying alive seems so very hard right now. i don't know what to do.
i'm sorry for not making much sense. "
I hate my life and wish I wasn't me (very long post),"I recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons.
I didn't have the worst life out there, lots of people have much worse lives then me, but I honestly feel so deeply depressed about how my life has turned out.
My mother died last year. We had a very difficult relationship. My dad went missing a few weeks before my 6th birthday (my last memory of him is inviting him to my birthday party) and turned up around my birthday in a river. We still have no idea what happened to him: if it was an accident, if he killed himself because of his believed schizophrenic disorders, murder... who knows. My parents already had a bad relationship and weren't living together at that point, but it changed our lives of course. My mother had a ton of mental health problems as well as chronic illnesses, due to having a highly abusive father growing up and a crippling injury, and my dad's death compounded them, not to mention she was raising two children on her own on benefits one of whom was autistic (me, I was diagnosed with asperger syndrome around this time). I love my mom very much, but she could be incredibly abusive due to her problems: I have memories of her spitting in my face, grabbing my hair and shaking my head like a rag doll when she lost control, screaming abuse when I knocked over a glass of water (I have dyspraxia as well as asperger's which made me very clumsy and struggle with organisation.) When I was 10 a friend of my mother's went through a psychotic episode and acted like he was going to molest me: if someone hadn't come along at that moment I still no idea what might have happened after he started hitting me on the arse and telling me to take my shorts down.
Teenage years were hard as well. My mother was very paranoid, and I wasn't allowed out the house on my own until I was almost sixteen (I had to have an escort walk me to and from school). I spent most of primary school and high school being bullied for various reasons, and I desperately wanted to make friends, yet lacked the social skills to make them: often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me, i would often be too scared to take them up on it, or not realise it. It didn't help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions I was invited. I was also struggling with my sexuality: I realised from an early age that I was attracted to boys, yet I did my best to suppress this: I was already being bullied for being the ""retard"" and the ""special needs kid"", and was often called ""faggot"" and so forth, i didn't want to be the weird gay kid as well. I didn't want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right. So I tried to force myself to be attracted to girls, even though I felt nothing towards them. It was easier to be in denial then accept I liked boys not girls. Mom was often quite homophobic: she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men, and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting. When she realised I was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while: accusing me of prostituting myself for old men. She would go through my phone and delete messages from boys.
I also really hated my body. I often thought i was fat or obese, but this was because i developed man boobs when I was 12, and was extremely paranoid about them. Despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life, I thought i was obese or extremely fat, and I've never taken my shirt off in public as a result, even though all I badly wanted to. It also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else. It made me absolutely loathe my body. It didn't help that I had acne on top of everything else, was bullied for my prominent front teeth, and my feminine facial features. I was often mistaken for a girl. I was also born with a small bladder: until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed, and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me: one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when I was six. So when I finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable, another popped up, and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasn't gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet. Because I was so lonely, i turned to binge eating, purging and hoarding to make myself feel better: I was so controlled in every way that those were the only things I could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness. I also hated birthdays: a lot of traumatic things happened around them: my godfather, who was the closest thing i had to a father, or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before I turned 15, so I had no one to teach me how to shave: my father's side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister, and my mother's family who I loved very deeply were on the other side of the Atlantic so I barely got to see them. I did love my only surviving grandmother very deeply, and some of my happiest childhood memories are of her. She died some years ago, and had resisted her daughter's attempts to bully her to disinherit me and my sister, though my aunts were incredibly hateful over this and did their best to remind me and my sister that they considered us thieves and entitled brats for not giving them their brother's share of my grandmother's estate. I miss my grandma so very much. She was one of the few people who ever gave me unconditional love, and sometimes I play the music box I got her for Christmas one year and think of her. It was a snow globe with her favourite flowers and bird inside it, and I feel so deeply nostalgic when I play it.
I eventually got into my dream university but because of my severe depression I would just lock myself in my dorm room, binge eat and cry, having absolutely no idea how to break out of it. I was very lonely. It ended up feeling more like the Bell Jar then my dreams finally coming true. By the time it was over I came very close to killing myself and spent most of that year in a suicidally depressed state. I eventually got to redo my final year, and made some wonderful friends who became a surrogate family. I was still sexually and romantically frustrated, due to my binge eating finally taking its toll and I gained a lot of weight during my depressive episode.
Eventually I graduated and had to move out. But i was finally happy in many ways, due to finally getting the social life I wanted: I finally was getting invited to parties and doing fun things. Mom had gotten very ill at this time, so I spent the year after graduating struggling to sort out my life and look after her at the same time: she became more and more emotionally volatile as her mental health was affected by her physical healths rapid decline. Eventually I took my life savings together and moved out, thinking i could look after her better if I had my own space, and i was tired of feeling ripped apart by loving her and resenting her for so many things. Six weeks later I got a call from the hospital, saying she had been admitted. For the next three months she was in and out of the hospital. I hated going there. I had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past, and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline, throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her, and then change her mind, all the while biting my tongue because I didn't want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though I had really really thought i hated my mother at this point, I still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much. My mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time. Eventually we got another call from the hospital, and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure. I remember staring at the heart monitor, praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going, holding my mother's hand... until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off. I said goodbye to my mom, and felt deep anguish: she was never going to meet her grandchildren, something she deeply wanted: for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother. I smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out.
Things got even worse. My mother had not made a will, and since the area we lived in, the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area, the house was now worth a lot of money: which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax. My mother was a very bad hoarder as well, so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill, the first of which came six months after her death. I eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance.
And now? I guess I've reached my breaking point. I'm 28, still have man boobs, have no money, haven't had a boyfriend in eight years, coming up to nine, have never had a job, just volunteer work, and have missed out on so much of life. When I clear out mom's stuff and take it to the charity shop, the loss hits me: so many things are mixed up in there, and it reminds me of times when I was either happy or hopeful for the future, and it feels so bitter that i can't go back to those times. All that's left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes. My sister lives overseas so I have no family left in the country. I just want to redo my life and not be autistic, or gay, or have man boobs, or have had so many mental and physical health problems. Or have had more family around me growing up: people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult, so I wouldn't have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life: helped me get into shape, helped me grow up, so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties, maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two, instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration.
I see my friends still, but sometimes it's painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs: they had families, are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up. Some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places: yet me I am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year. I don't know... I keep slipping into these daydreams were I didn't have so much shit happen to me: where I am not autistic, where I didn't have such an unstable upbringing, where I met a nice boyfriend and didn't have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldn't shift no matter how much exercise I did... a guy who I could go on dates with, play games with, snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with, someone who would take me home to meet his family. I wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal. I wish I wasn't born with so many things wrong with my body and mind, that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then I could bear. I wish I had had a big family around me growing up. I just wish I had had a bit more.... stability and normality, then all this chaos.
I don't know. i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor, but I feel so deeply sad about how much of life I have missed out on, and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt. I want to kill myself, but I know I couldn't do that to my loved ones.
I don't know why I wrote this. Venting I guess. I keep wishing i could redo my life. I wish some pieces had come together better. Like if I had to be autistic, I didn't have to be gay as well. If I had to lose my dad, I didn't have to lose my mom as well. That my mom hadn't had so many things wrong with her, because she wasn't a bad person, just very damaged physically and mentally. That my family in America had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing: that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit, that my cousins had been the big brothers I needed to be a man: teach me to shave, take me out, helped me work out, how to socialise, that I had my baby cousins to look after, read stories too, play games with because I always wanted to be a big brother too, and was often sad that I didn't have babies and kids to look after (I have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that I never had any younger siblings growing up). That I had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so I knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach. I wish I could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day. I wish I had a nice boyfriend. I wish I hadn't had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off.
I feel selfish for wanting to turn back time, as the world doesn't revolve around my happiness, I just wish there had been a bit more balance? I didn't expect a happy life handed to me on a platter, I just wish.... so many burdens hadn't been given to me that prevented me from having the life I wanted.... I just wish I could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely, isolating struggle. There's a lot more I haven't mentioned but I just wish I could wake up and have it be a long time ago, before so many things got worse and worse. I know it's very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse, but I just hate myself and I hate being me. I just wish things hadn't been such a struggle and I wasn't going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else. I guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds: it's made me feel wistful for past times, and deeply miss my dad and grandma, and wish I could have had things be a bit more normal: to be a bit more like my peers, and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now.
I wish it was years ago. Making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her. Or playing Ocarina of Time for the first time. That magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time. Time passes. It feel so strange there was a time when I was a child. Or a young teen. Or a twenty year old, and I actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse. It feels sad that I feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life I've found often so very sad and unbearably lonely. I feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person: it's impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness. I can't help it though: if I could make those daydreams of being young and in love, and having my family be more normal and alive around, and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen, I would.
I know it's a lot of whine here, but I guess I just wanted to get things off my chest. I know I have to a accept the past and that it's gone and it's written, but I just wish things had been less awful. I keep thinking: if this was how my life was going to be, why was I born? I didn't ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken, unstable background that's never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life. Sometimes I wish I'd never been born or I'd killed myself years ago. Thank you for reading."
Loved ones?,"Will you just disappear and not tell your loved ones that you won't be back?
Will you leave a note?
I'm torn ... I hate the thought of them knowing I'm gone for good but have so much unsaid."
37 years and counting,"English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. I am 37 years old, I live in a major city of South America. I have an ok job that allows me to live with no financial worries. I also have a master's degree and a good reputation among some people in my field. But I want to die everyday.I guess it all comes from the realization that we are irreparably alone. That love is an illusion. That romantic love is an invention so deeply inoculated in our societies that we are all screwed up for good.At least that is the way I rationalized the loss of my ex. She is from Europe and she lived with me for a year and a half. Suddenly she didn't want to have sex and started to came late from her meetings with her friends. In december 2016 she went to England to her master's graduation and I stayed in my country because I thought she needed space. To make the story short, I discovered she was cheating on me with an english guy she met at her job in my country and she was traveling through England with him.In less than six months she left my country and went to England to live with that guy.It is been nine months since we split and I am tired of this thing we call life. I can't even think of falling in love again. I don't want to kill myself but I just can't make sense of anything anymore. The more I read, the more I travel, the more I listen to music, the more I think about killing myself.My ex's infidelity was just the trigger to something I've always had inside me. I don't even know why I am sharing this. I've read a lot of the posts in here and I don't even feel sympathy for anyone. But i feel solidarity with them. I truly believe society must provide the human beens like us a painless way to commit suicide without all the censorship and guilty some people want us to feel.In the meantime, I am 37 year old and waiting to die. Life is a painfully slow waiting for nothing to happen."
I'm no doubt going to kill myself at one point in my life.,"I just can't do it anymore.
Drugs really make me cope.
I don't like going to the doctors, I don't like even talking.
When I talk, someone gets pissed off.
Ever since I was a child, I would go long periods of time without talking, it just felt overbearing to talk. Like, dirty, to me. I even hate the quick convos for chatting about buying drugs. I just want the guy to set a date, and every week at the same time I pick it up, without even seeing each other or talking.
Anyways, I plan to kill myself at one point in my life, and it really just feels like a release just saying it. Thinking about dying just releases all of this tightness within my cranial cavity, and i just feel bliss. "
I go back and forth about dying and not dying.,"I just went through a really hard breakup. My ex and I are communicating, which makes things more confusing. He's friendly enough, but I just would like to know where he stands. My job is also slowly killing me. I keep reading about how to commit suicide, but all the methods I read about are too terrifying for me to try. I want something painless, but I'm also sort of scared to die. As scared as I am of dying though, I really am tired of living and have been for a long time. I feel like I can't reach out to anyone, so that's why I'm here, I guess."
rick and morty,"i need more shows with characters like rick. I need to see a character whose whole attitude is ""I'm going to do whatever I want and not worry about the consequences because I'm suicidal anyway and if I die then I'm cool with that but if I don't and just have a really awesome experience then that's cool too""it kinda makes me feel like someone as shitty and suicidal as me can do things that aren't 100% ruined by my participation in them"
"I can relate to this quote from movie called ""I stand alone"" (1998)","""Being born against your will. Eat. Wave your dick around. Make new life. Die. Life is one big void. It's always been and it'll always be. A large void that can do just fine without me. I don't want to play that game anymore. not in this life. I want to experience something personal, something intense. I don't want to be the final replaceable part of a giant machine. I don't know. I must find a reason... an excuse or what ever
to find the motivation to go on another 20 years. Until I die. If I start my life all over I'd want to make porn movies. It's all clear. The people who do that understand the human race. Either you're born with a cock
which has to be a big hard dick filling snatches. Or you're born with a pussy which has to be filled with cock. In both scenarios you'll still be alone. Yeah, I'm a dick. That's it. I'm a sad, sad dick... and to earn some respect I must be hard all the time."""
I've seen how good it can be and find it hard to cope now,"I'm 19 and have been suffering from depression since I was 14, got it officially diagnosed nearly a year ago when things got harder than ever, went to my college counselor, jumped through the hoops of therapy and antidepressants and trying to not let my family and friends know what's going on. I've given up on both therapy and the medication for a few reasons. One thing that has brought me joy throughout my life is my significant other who I met online four years ago. I recently got work for the summer, saved up and traveled 9,000km to visit him. I spent 10 days with him and it was everything I hoped it was, it felt like we'd be together for ever, I felt like someone actually cared about me for a change. Back here at home I have friends but I don't feel I connect well with them, I'm more friends out of proximity than anything else. They're all great people and I enjoy my time with them but I just don't think I mix well with them which leaves me feeling pretty alone in general even when I'm with them. Being gay and pretty unhappy about it means I've never had a relationship before this and I've never met anyone who I was interested in.Having spent those days with my S/O I didn't feel depressed or suicidal at all, it was genuinely the happiest I've ever been. Now I'm in a position where I won't be able to visit him for atleast a year. I'm in my final year of a pretty intensive, full time college course where I won't be finished until next September, I won't even be able to work next summer because my course will take up all of my time. I'm really upset about all this and I'm anxious that something might happen in all that time. Having experienced that happiness and knowing it's so far away again makes my depression even worse and it's been pushing me back into a place where it feels like giving up now instead of holding on is easier and might save me from anymore upset. It's given me something to work towards now which is great but I've trust issues, I've depression and I've still got all of my usual problems. It's getting harder and harder for me to want to hold on."
I'm going to kill myself soon,"It's only been two weeks of school but I've never felt so much pain and I've had depression since I was 12 I'm 15 now. I'm so tired but I have homework and I'll get yelled at if I don't finish it but I'm literally so tired and lonely everybody at school either makes fun of me or talks to me like I'm a dog in a really patronizing tone I'm going to jump in front of a train that will be the quickest way to die, literally I can't stand being myself I would love to see places like L.a and Tokyo and do amazing things but I'm so stupid, I have no social skills and I'm so weird and ugly I'll never be able to make anything of myself, everyone around me thinks I'm insane my parents defiantly think so, I can't stop daydreaming it's all I ever do I can't stop it's like a disease it's torture I don't actually care about what is happening, I really want to do more things but I cannot keep being this lonely for the rest of my life the pain I feel is torture "
tonight i close off,"tonight i close off. i do not have anybody.not much family and the few members i have arent that close to me, or hate me cuz they hated my mom.no friends, in my almost 20 years of life ive had about 5-8 friends, and they all left or i pushed them away with my problems. all my life i wanted one person... just one... someone i could rely on, be there for, someone to hold and watch movies with, play games, cook, travel... so im not alone...tonight the guy i opened myself to, first person i cuddled with, kissed, told me hes not ready for any relationship even though he wanted one since we started talking. i was closing off when we met and he kept hinting at a relationship and to not close off and now this... lmao... you may think boo hoo another teen heartbroken with first love. nah fam ive tried a few ldr/online relationships and ive heard the same excuse - im not ready / i need to improve and find myself and so do you. aka you aint good enough.which is funny, cuz i cant find myself when im all alone, all i can do is wallow in sadness, cut and have suicidal thoughts. i need that one person to have hope, a purpose, to feel like im not alone. but i cant have that. im done trying, because im never good enough for anybody. literally. not a friend, not a boyfriend. hell i cant even escape my thoughts anymore. after 12 years of gaming i cant stomach it. i suck at it and have nobosy who even wants to play with me.why am i writing this here? do i look like i have someone to write to? no.. and i wont. cuz tonight i close off. i cant handle more heartbreak from people lying, using me and leaving. and i hope with time i can build courage to kms since i have nobody at all. just need to be a man and do it"
It doesn't work. Why doesn't it work?,"I'm in a bit of a bad spot mentally right now and I'm currently experimenting with hanging, as a sort of a failsafe, if nothing else. Without being really explicit about the specifics, theoretically what I'm doing should make me pass out in a handful of seconds without having to constrict the airway or even suspend myself fully off the floor. But in my fiddling around, I've found that it hasn't worked like that, at least not yet. It's uncomfortable and hurts and the last thing I'm doing is passing out. I don't know if I need more weight or use a different kind of knot or if I need to put the noose around my neck differently because holy fuck I can't even figure out how to kill myself right.I don't want to die in a long, drawn out, painful way. I don't want to live, either. Everything is sort of hazy and I'm being selfish and narrow minded and ungrateful and instead of figuring out how to deal with the coming weeks like a normal person I'm lying in bed feeling sorry for myself. I don't know what I need. The future is already hazy and uncertain and I can't even have a surefire way of going out quick. I was only experimenting but the possibility that I would somehow screw it up and accidentally kill myself didn't bother me at all.I'm a mess. There shouldn't be anything wrong with me but it feels like everything is and I can't see myself dealing with life at all. If you can, please help"
Read if you want.,"I dont know how to start this...Girl/13.  Ive contemplated it many times...but I havent.Im afraid of what my friends/family will think and feel.I used to get bullied/harassed at my old school  but I was used to that.

I have bad dreams(about me being killed or dieing)almost every night and sometimes I cry myself awake.Ive thought about not fighting anymore,Im definitely not strong,but I will keep doing it.I have bad trust issues,and that caused me to not be able to trust anyone,I can some people but not a lot of people. I dont trust myself sometimes either.. I dont know what to say in this but thank you if you read it."
"Just please, someone help me find a solution, I'm begging you.","I've been in therapy for over 5 years, I've been twice in a psych ward, I'm taking 3 different kinds of pills, I've tried countless other pills, I've tried working out more than a few times in my life, including the past month and it only makes things worse.
I've tried looking for new hobbies, I've been an actor for 2 years, I've painted, I've built kit models, I animated, I went out, I tried to meet new people. Nothing helps me, I don't want to do this to my parents, I don't want to go back to a psych ward, but I will kill myself if I have to.I've had nothing but bad experiences in my life, any small sign of friendship was instantly shattered, I've never been in a relationship, and I'm pretty much traumatized from females yet I feel the need for one. Nothing made me happier than playing videogames, but it appears my joy of it is slowly fading along with my bank account while spending all my money trying to find a satisfying game.I don't want to kill myself but it seems to be the only solution."
Recent thoughts of suicide and talking to someone about it,"Hey. I've always ignored how much I thought about suicide in the past. Most recently I decided to pay attention and ended up realizing that I think at least a couple times a day what would life be without me; how the life of my loved ones would move forward, which way I'd choose to go.My family is very strict about this subject ��� my uncle commited suicide about 11 years ago and almost no one ever talked about it ��� and talking to them about what I'm feeling will just cause unnecessary pain and concern.On the other hand, I've been with this girl for the past 8 months and it's been great. We've never talked about depression or suicide specifically but I've mentioned a few times how fucked up my life was/can be. Having her around is great and, honestly, one of the few things that I really enjoy lately, though she's gonna study abroad for a year (yeah, that's messing me up a bit, but anyway).I just wanna know if I should talk to her about it and how I can do it so that she doesn't feel guilty. Will it help me? Will it fuck up our relationship?I'm afraid that those intrusive thoughts will escalate into something more real, more intense. "
I keep going.,"I just keep going. For what reason? I keep trying again and again, but find the same thing. It always ends with me feeling worse than I did before. When will it stop. When."
Going on with my awful life,"I've lost the only person I care about which is my boyfriend and I don't know how to continue on and have motivation to even live. This is the worst day of my life. I won't kill myself because that'll hurt him but I really want to die.
Not existing would ease my pain and I wouldn't have to sit here crying for hours on end. I'm so alone. I wish I knew that the last time I held him would be the last. Would've cherished it more or maybe, actually fixed the situation we're in. I hate myself for bringing him pain.
I could throw up because of how worthless I feel, All I want is him. I'm giving him the time and space to decide if he wants to be with me and if his decision is to never come back, then that's the only way this could get worse. My heart is broken all because of me ruining this relationship. "
Please help me..is there anyone on here willing to listen?,"I am feeling suicidal today, for the first time in about 5 months. I will do my best to sum things up here, however it's still going to be long either way I'm afraid - had depression/anxiety/low self esteem/ptsd for a number of years. Been having DBT therapy weekly for nearly two years now. Has been incredibly helpful, more so than any other therapy I've tried, medications etc. A couple of months back a had a 'turning point' with the therapy and could really feel the impact it had had. I felt truly positive for the first time in years. Truly happy. Like I was able to conquer anything. And it wasn't fake this time (and I know what that feels like, this wasn't it). This was different. I was doing incredibly well. However - a couple of months ago after speaking with my therapist about it for a while, I decided to get back in contact with my absent father (since parents divorce when I was 15, now 27) via a long letter. I got short response letter back a week later. The response was fairly positive. However, the phone call we had two days later, was not and he was belittling, insulting about my epilepsy, brought up the past, was derogatory towards my mum, lied about a few things etc. Ended very badly and I ended contact with him for good. Since then I have taken about 10 steps back therapy-wise and it has been affecting every area of my life, but particularly my relationship with my boyfriend which started just before i got in contact with my dad again. Everything was great with my boyfriend before, because I actually felt good enough, I felt positive all the time and because I felt good enough I had nothing to worry about. But now..I have the same question that has come back that has haunted me for years, and even though there is a rational part of me that knows it is my dad with the problem and not me..I still end up chalking it down to me not being good enough for him, or anyone. That question is ""if my dad doesn't love me, who will?"". Or similar questions. ""If my dad won't stick by me, what man will?"". I only seem to see the negative and not the positive like my mum sticking by me, because my negative thoughts and worries are so powerful that I truly believe my mum and anyone else in my life including my boyfriend would be better off without me. I don't even think they want me in their lives. I can't tell my boyfriend any of this because I've only been with him for about 9 weeks and although he knows the dad stuff and some things from my past and he was understanding and helpful, if I tell him I'm suicidal right now that's a one way ticket to losing a boyfriend. I don't want to tell any of my 'friends', I already feel like they don't want to talk to me most of the time and when I do talk to them I feel like because we hardly speak because we live far apart etc I don't want to be that Debbie Downer every time I speak to them. I'm just pushing everyone away, when I speak to them and when I don't speak to them. I feel paranoid and suspicious about my boyfriend a lot. I never feel good enough but then I feel no man is good enough for me, my standards are so incredibly high because of my past with abusive relationships. I can't even explain everything in this post and now I'm just rambling. I don't know what to do. I can't stop crying. I just hate myself and I hate my brain, I'm in a constant battle with it when I get in states like this, even when I don't feel suicidal. I struggle so much with pushing negative thoughts out of my mind. They are so much easier to believe than positive ones. Will I ever feel good enough? Why is there no painless way to end everything? I can't get a break from my overthinking. I can't even speak to my therapist about it most of the time because she's not an on call therapist and I only see her weekly for 50 mins, and in the moods I've been in the past month or so, most of the time I've felt like I could talk to someone for hours :( "
Looking for reasons to live.,"I'm 18 years old, living in the UK and to put it bluntly I no longer have any reasons to live.
I'm not a well-liked person in general, probably my own fault, I don't particularly make effort to befriend people and never like talking to anyone outside of my immediate small group of friends. In this small group of friends I have no one I feel any particular closeness to, no one to really talk to about anything personal. (Hence why I'm using reddit).
Just over a year ago I was left by someone that was in many ways my best friend, probably the only person I have ever been able to really talk to. After this long period of time being apart, despite efforts to distance myself from her I am still pathetically in love with her. (It's hard to illustrate through text how that feels but to summarise...agony). Within a few weeks she will have moved away, and I will likely never speak to her again. Added to this the fact that since we broke up, I have not been able to even successfully secure a single date and I have had to frequently hear from mutual friends how happy she is and all about what new guy she is dating.But the thing that really breaks my heart, is the fact that my own family don't love me.My mom is someone I have never gotten along with and she makes it apparent that she wants me to leave home as soon as possible, to the point where she has threatened to throw me out if necessary. (Currently I cannot afford to leave, despite working full time). I also have a brother and sister I wouldn't consider myself close with.In conclusion, I have no close friends, the only person I've loved will soon be out of my life forever and each night I come home to hear my family tell me I need to leave home soon. It's hard to see a point in life anymore."
I feel like I'm crumbling.,"My entire life feels like its crumbling. I can't score well on the ACT and SAT, getting a 25 and an 1160 respectively. I can't concertrate for more than 5 minutes because all I think about are games. My parents have been for some time abusing me emotionally and sometimes physically. They're always pressuring me to work 24/7 despite me telling them I'm trying to do the most I can. I go to a very difficult school and my GPA is low too, hovering at a 3.1. I feel like I won't get into any college and that I will always live under my parents roof and will continue this lifestyle until I'm 30.I try to eat my feelings out, but everytime I do I get intense pain due to my intestinal problems. I have the intense urge to cause myself to vomit but I feel like if I do I would get the craving again. I don't care. All I want at this point is to just end everything. Nothing is worth living for, I have nobody. Nobody wants to be with me. Nobody likes me. Everybody I know has a negative opinion of me. My own best friend who said she trusted me found out I had a small crush on her, and now stays away from me. All I want is affection. I never get any at home and anytime someone shows me even the tiniest bit of kindness I'm instantly attracted. Its disgusting and sad I can't help it. All I want to be loved. I'm tired of this life and all these responsibilities and I just want to stay a kid I never want to grow up and killing myself seems like the best answer. I'm lost and I want a way out."

So overwhelmed,Trying to make friends in college but something is off about me. I'm either too friendly or too standoffish. People don't seem to want to be around me. I'm just quiet and shy and most of the guys I befriend automatically assume I must like them. I hate living like this. Every night it seems there is a faux pas that sends me spiralling into suicidal thoughts. I become so nervous around people that I get super choked up and talk fast. I'm really trying to improve myself and build my self confidence but I don't know how much longer I can live with these feelings.
I wish I was suicidal...grrrrrr,"I have never been a happy person. For no good reason I have always been depressed, frustrated and sad. I have great family who would be devastated but they don't need me and I know they'd be better off without me and my problems in the long run (LOL how cliche). I've spent years in therapy (how middle class), I've been on so many anti-depressants with varying results. But no matter how they have made me feel, I have never been able to resolve my long standing issues with anxiety and depression and my inability to function in everyday life.I know deep down that it's over for me. The hope for a life that I can enjoy and be proud of is just a pipe dream. I have a suicide plan and have gone through the motions over a dozen times but when it comes to dropping there's a part of me that just can't let go. I just want to go but don't have the courage or selflessness to do it. I have been this way since I was about 13 and I'm 30 now. Sorry to bum you out, but I can't really talk to non-professionals about my problems in real life because they would freak the **** out. But I guess I wanted to see if anybody else feels the same or if anyone had advice about how to deal with that emptiness you get when you want to be gone but are still here.Thanks for reading."
I have to choose between self-improvement and suicide and I want to choose suicide,"I suck and the reason I suck is that I've sucked at being me for my entire life. It's not that I can't work towards bettering myself...but it's like I don't want to. That's not a depression lie, it's just how I feel. My depression is my fault too. Everything wrong with my life is. I have the power to change it, but I also have the power to end it. I can just give up. It's going to hurt physically, but I can almost taste that sweet, sweet release from myself. The burden I've placed on myself that is my life could just be swept under the rug. It's the perfect form of escapism. No, I don't want to talk."
Does anyone else ever feel like they are too ugly to be alive?,"I thought i had gotten better at coping with body image issues and general lack of confidence by starting to understand reasons why im like this. However i seem to be more sad frequently, trust issues and anxiety have been going through the roof and cry almost on a daily basis.
I'm scared I'm gunna push away this guy i have been recently dating (who has so far been wonderful and supportive) and i can't comprehend why he is interested in me, how he can bare to look at me and i almost expect him to cheat on me/leave me for another girl coz why would you be with me when you could be with someone else?
I'm so tired of feeling like this, I'm so easily triggered now and I really don't know how much longer I can take this. I hate being so bothered by such superficial things, i feel totally useless as a human and wish i wasn't like this. I just want to be happy and pleasant to be around but i don't know how and i feel like my friends don't get how seeing a photo of myself or my reflection makes me feel like i deserve to be killed. If anyone can relate.. i would appreciate someone willing to listen or talk to or help in some way.
Tldr; i am really struggling with body image/dysmoprhia/confidence, am scared of being hurt again relationship wise and if anyone can relate or be of help i would appreciate someone to talk to :("
I thought I found a reason,"I thought that the thing which kept me for years actually happened again and I feel in love. Maybe I get pushed away maybe these loves never come true but atleast falling for someone helped to climb out of my hole. High enough to have a pretty long way before I can keep digging.
But now this seems to be over. I was at the most terrible point in my life, I thought I would find something but I can't believe into anything. No friends no family no partner.
I don't even mean romantical love I just mean any way of love starting by myself ending with a partner but I must admit that this seems to be over for me.
I'm at the bottom and I feel that soon I will have been digging so deep that I am going to fall. Into the abyss in my dreams but on the hard floor, 6 floors deep in real life."
Should I give in?,"So at school, a few of my friends told me that someone had a gun, and was threatening to shoot up the school while we were there. I ended up telling a police officer. Later that day I found out that I gave false info on the person who had the gun, so I tried to fix it but my teachers told me to stay out of it. When school let out that day, I recieved messages from the person that I said had the gun but didn't. He said that he hopes I kill myself and he wants me to cut my wrists. He said that if I ever get pregnant, he hopes my kids die. I'm 15 and already have major depression. I'm scared to go back to school because of him. Should I just give in and kill myself?"
I feel like a ghost,"I want to talk to people, but I'm too worried and afraid to approach people thinking they'll think I'm weird or annoying. So I just stay silent and hesitate about what I will say to people. I've got no one I can talk to in real life, and that's all I want. I can't keep things from being boring. If I was dead I'm sure most of the people in my classes would just be surprised who I was/was in their class."
Colors,"The sky is blueAnd the grass is greenBut who are youTo tell me who to be?My skin is tanAnd blood is redIf you held my hand,Maybe none would have to be shed.My faith in godHas long since goneBecause I thought I had love.I guess I was wrong."
My Last Week,I can't endure this pain any longer. It's been so many years I forgot the last time I felt okay. I have so many mental and physical health problems and I won't seem to be able to be independent at this rate. I feel I may as well be a vegetable at this point with how useless I am with all my health problems. I refuse to be a burden and a dead weight weighing my friends and family down. I've come to terms with this and the fact that I probably wasn't one of the ones that were meant to live a long and happy life. I feel I'm probably going to put an end to it all this week.
Three of my friends have died in the last 365 days. I'm doing poorly in school and I'm likely not going to go to college or have a future. My parents hate me for it and have already threatened to disown me. I have a really low IQ. Tell me why I shouldn't end it now.,"Hello. I'm a teenager in my junior year of high school in a sparsely populated mountainous state in the United States. School started a month ago for me, as I go to a private academy. And guess what? Despite my best efforts, I'm already failing. And badly. And my parents say they're going to disown me.I've struggled with school my whole life. I've always had trouble learning things, let's say. It's been an emotionally distressing struggle too. I've cried my way through school, trying my best, I once was forced to get a learning disability and IQ test by my school. I have no learning disabilities. I have an IQ of 73. For those uninformed on the scale of IQ tests, that's pretty low.I have no real skills. I'm not ""good with people"", I'm not a good artist, repairman, programmer, and I have a problem where I seem to fuck up just about everything I touch. So unless you count rotting and doing homework as a skill, I'm essentially unskilled. And honestly, I just don't want to become an unskilled laborer. I don't want to become a ""cook"" at some shitty fast food restaurant, I don't want to be a construction worker, I don't want to be a janitor, I don't want to be a retail worker, you get my point, don't you?So because of this, my dad (who, for the record, is Asian, Vietnamese to be precise) is threatening to disown me. In his own words, ""I will not have one of my descendants be a blue-collar unskilled idiot. That's the road you're headed down. Fix it. You WILL go to college and work a professional job and make me proud. Or you won't be my son anymore."" Of course, that's not the only thing he's said. He's said a lot more.Oh yeah, and that's not even the only problem! One of my closest friends committed suicide last Halloween. I was out trick-or-treating with him that night, I still remember it so clearly. He didn't seem to be very happy, and when I asked him what was wrong he wouldn't tell me. Eventually he had to go home. Then he shot himself. No note. No nothing.Then another one of my very close friends committed suicide in January because people were bullying and blackmailing her.Then someone else close to me committed suicide yesterday.My close friends are dead. I'm failing school. I've tried too hard to tolerate myself being an ""unskilled, laboring, idiot"". My parents are unhappy with me and I'm going to get disowned. I'm running out of time. It's nowhere but down from here. I've already devised quite a few ways I could go out.So tell me, what reason do I have to  die? Seriously."
"A cry for help, I guess.","For the past several years I've been depressed. Not majorly depressed though, I'd have moments of happiness. But even in the moments where I would be laughing and enjoying myself, there was always the subtle weight of depression hanging over my head. As the years went on, that feeling just kept getting stronger and stronger. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past, but they were always just thoughts - I always knew I would never actually do it. But in the past few weeks these suicidal thoughts have been much louder and they're starting to sound more and more rational. I've always been quiet and introverted; I don't like talking to the people in my life about anything serious. I just hide my depression behind thick layers of ironic humor and it's fucked me up over the years. I'm completely lost and suicide sounds so fucking relaxing now. Knowing that I could just end all my problems and suffering so easily is such a comforting thought. I'm a junior in university, just transferred here from a community college. I've never known how to make friends. Now I'm living on campus with a bunch of people I don't know, not talking to anyone, not going out, not meeting new people. I'm a business major so there's a lot of pressure to be active in activities and get experience to add to my resume so I can get an internship and look attractive to employers. But I can't do any of that. My social anxiety is so fucking strong, how the hell am I supposed to get through life if I can't even do simple shit like talking to people? Life is supposed to be a healthy mix of doing things you enjoy and doing things you don't enjoy; I know it's not rational for a person to be happy all the time, enjoying every moment they're in. But for me, especially lately, there are seldom moments where I find I'm happy. The majority of my time is spent doing things I don't want to do. I don't find joy in anything anymore. Nothing excites me, nothing can motivate me, I feel so disconnected from other people. Everything is so dull. Even the things that I used to really enjoy, like sex for example, is just so bland. Sex used to be the one thing that I had that I really enjoyed. I used it to cope with my depression for the longest time. But now that's turned dull, just like everything else. If I don't find anything enjoyable anymore then what's the point? I genuinely cannot think of a reason to not kill myself. There's no reward in life anymore, why would I stick around? It's all just fucking shit and dealing with sadness and discomfort and anxiety all the time. I so badly want to just not exist. I don't know why I'm writing this. I've never talked to anyone about any of this because I don't know how to ask for help. I guess I'm just hoping someone can convince me that life is worth living, because I'm getting scared at how enticing suicide is becoming. "
I just... am lost... gonna end it today,"(i am not going to use caps in this, sorry ya grammar nazis) hi. i never thought it would come to asking the internet for help... but here i am. i have considered suicide since a young age. i always pushed past those ""phases"". but lately... i am just having doubts. doubts i will ever be accepted or love. i have been putting on a facade for years, no one around me really knows how i feel. how ever night i pull out my moms pills to hold in my hands for hours, how i take ""late walks"" to the bridge and look over it. it is almost comforting, thinking about dropping my worries. let me explain, i guess. i am still not an adult, but not young enough to have no expectations. i am a junior in highschool. lately, my mom and dad have been going at it again. from a young age, my dad has been addicted to meth. he would stand in my moms face and call her... unspeakable things. he would stand in the living room with a knife to his neck demanding money. he would get it and just leave... like nothing happened. my mom, also suffers from extreme depression. she had quit her job at one point in the summer and laid in bed naked for 4 days. during those days, i watched and cared for all my siblings. 3 brothers, two of which have autism (schizophrenia and aspergers, some other smaller mental disorders that caused the oldest to become easily attached to things). and 1 sister (the youngest hadn't been born till a year and a half after). my older brother (my only older sibling) was abusive. he would threaten to gut me and chase me with knives, he constantly beat me, and i couldnt fight back. not because i wasn't strong enough, but because i couldn't bring myself to hurt him. anyways, those days of no adults and me stepping up to plate have really affected me. lately i have had nightmares of those days, and how hopeless i felt. i had no one to tuck me in, my mom, bless her heart, had always been there. i was mortified of being alone. after that, things got worst. one night, not to long after my dad came back, he was, angry. the house wasn't clean and my mom still lied in bed. he proceded to, hurt her and threaten us. i remember grabbing a knife and rushing to grab my siblings. but he, hit me hard. i had never been so terrified. from that point on my mom and dad have been at each others necks. he still to this day is addicted to meth, and my mom still speaks of killing herself. i am a relatively popular person, i have friends, and i actually like that. they are the only thing keeping me afloat. i, like other people got into bad eating habits at a young age. years of mom going to mcdonalds every night for dinner conditioned my body for the future junk food. it became my comfort. after elementary, middle school was... awful. i grew up in a city called omaha, some might know it. but it is a very... bad city. at least where i lived: north omaha. i was ridiculed for being fat. i also developed love for... well men. i was called fag and beat up, constantly. i had always been ""bullied"" whether for being poor, fat, or ""fugly"". i was mortified. for two years, one thing i said haunted me and caused all my friends to leave me and become my enemies, the day i said ""i am gay"". you might be think ""you cant decide your sexuality at that age"" but in north omaha, everyone was already losing their virginity by seventh grade. i just didn't feel attracted to girls. i had one friend to get me through, the one person i never told, even to this day, my cousin. me and my cousin, like most family grew less close over the years, he moved constantly, and his mom, who was in the army, was stationed in germany. i lose my best friend, and was all alone till high school. then we finally moved, i wont say where, because i am still living there, but it was further into iowa. i was able to be myself and have friends, i was ecstatic, i was finally happy. but... but things change i guess. i just have grown hopeless, i notice the looks of disgust i get from my ""friends"", i am not very good looking, obviously. i have lose some weight over the years, like 30 pounds or so, and i thought i was happy with myself. but recently, i was just going to school and someone called me fag. i, i was confused and, i... i... thought that almost adults would be accepting, or at least tolerant of me. but, i guess that is hopeless too. i am so tired, of the looks i get, of the people around me changing, about my family, about how now when i look in the mirror all i see are flaws. no matter how hard i try, no matter what i do, no matter how much i pray to god to be merciful. the blows keep coming, they don't stop. i never have been happy, i sit and nod my head smiling when my friends talk to me, smile whenever people catch me frowning. i just can't go on living lies, i know i am not happy, i know i am ugly and fat and stupid. i am just lying thinking, about how i could end it. i don't want my family to wake up to a dead body, i cannot imagine that. even if i don't always like them, i love my family. i don't want them to think this is completely their fault. i am gonna throw myself in the missouri river tomorrow night. i just want to not feel anything anymore, i don't want to worry about college, or stopping my parents from hitting each other, or worrying about how i look, or keep thinking about how my life is going to be just like my dad's: a drug addict who beats his wife. i hate it. i hate crying. but i am crying right now. i just cant. but the thing is i am scared. i dont want to die. i just want to... start over. every bad thing in my life could've been solved, i could've called cps, i could've not come out, i could have worked out and eaten right, i could have helped more people, done more for others. i know there are other people suffering, and people way worse off, but right now, that isn't enough to stop me. i am a self loathing, attention whore, i know. and posting here is just going to justify that. but before i do end it. i just want to... laugh. i want to feel warmth again. i know i sound ""emo"" but, i just miss getting hugs and sleeping by my mom and dad. i miss the days when school was fun and i wasn't worrying about everyone judging me, and about how well i am doing. i hate it, i hate... myself. i just want to see my grandma again. all those days i spent scrapbooking and cooking with her are my best memories, but she is gone and no one in the world gives a shit. so if i disappear, will anyone really care? and no, i know everyone will be sad for like a few weeks, and yatta yatta. but in a year, no one will remember who i was. the art i did, the songs i sang, the games i played will be boxes thrown in the attic, everyone will forget. for the best of course, i am not sad, i just think that the life i am living isn't mine anymore. i am hurt, my family, my ""friends"", myself, they left me broken, and i glued myself back together with religion and games and music and school, but now, the glue has come undone. i just don't care anymore. i cannot put on those smiles anymore, i can't belt out notes anymore, i can't make art anymore. i cant do anything right. i am a peice of shit. this world would be better off without me, some whiny fag... thanks for reading my life. i will be done. i am sorry for being me. i know i am being selfish right now, but damnit i have tried for other people for too long. goodbye. i hope you will at least have the kindness to post some funny memes below. anything to get me to smile, please. i appreciate it, thanks."
Morning Thoughts,"There was a time I believedas I aged my emotions would subside. In hindsight, I have learnedto bury those feelings deep within.Still, I have days where I am consumed. ��I have asked to die more times than I can count. But, still I sit here writing to no one.I am still on this earth as it spins silentlythrough the darkness of eternity.��When I was younger there were nights the fear of my mortality would paralyze me.Though now, I look at the inevitable and am happy to oblige.��To leave this cesspool of anger and hate.To no longer be bothered by the corporationsdrunk on greed who run this world.��I have seen the wrath of evil first hand. I have seen the aftermath left in its wake.I have been subjected to cruel judgments. I have been told to crawl in a hole and die. I have starved myself to feel confident. I have cut myself to focus on the pain.I have drugged myself to feel happy even if it's fleeting.��What terrifies me thoughI finally realized I have lost myself in this world."
I'm getting closer with each day.,"Like the title says, every day I come closer to taking my own life. Mostly because I don't want to work for the rest of my life, I just don't see the point. I'm going to work for the next 50 to 60 years at manual labor and dead end jobs only to struggle to get by and end up dying in a hospital room I can't afford. That isn't a life I've ever wanted. I've been thinking this way since I was little and I can't see another option besides suicide. If I keep going like this I'll end up killing myself. If I quit working I'll be homeless and my girlfriend will leave me which again leads me to suicide. The meds I have taken over the years haven't helped even a little. Therapy hasn't helped either because all people say is to get a new job or to find happiness in my work, but that's the problem. I HATE WORKING. It's pointless filling my bosses pocket by trading in my life for money if I'm miserable and have everything that is actually good in my life  (few things) overshadowed with dreading work. Not to mention the anxiety I have for just knowing I have to go. It's not worth it and I can't think of anything to solve the problem. I want to live and be happy obviously, but that just isn't going to happen as long as I have to work. But in order to to live I have to have money. It's and endless cycle I want out of. I tell everyone I'm not gonna kill myself but I'm not sure if that holds true anymore. I can feel my will power draining away every day. I don't feel like I'll be here much longer and that scares me. Not because I'm scared of death, but because I don't want to hurt my family and friends."
Nobody will ever love me,"All of the relationships I've ever had were just internet relationships, and none of them ended well. The one person I had a crush on, who was my best friend, already found someone else that they are in love with. I feel like I will never have anyone. I'm transgender and I have social anxiety too, which doesn't help either. I just want someone to love me but obviously that's never going to happen."
I really wish I could contract some extremely lethal disease.,"I'm really fed up with life, I know I'm going nowhere and I just don't want to be around anymore, death is best for me, but I feel too weak to kill myself, so I've been recently hoping for some horrible accident to happen to me so I can be dead, I won't have to upset people who know me, and I won't have to go to the effort of killing myself."
Failed Hanging,"I don't know if anyone can help or advise. Briefly I've always had issues with stress , panic attacks and anxiety. Recently getting worse and worse. The other morning, got up got changed for work decided enough was enough and hung myself. No note, not a cry for help was just gonna do it. I blacked out and woke up on the floor covered in snot and tears. The cheap star wars dressing gown belt had snapped. I know if it hadn't I would of gone.
I don't know where to go from here? I am too ashamed to tell my family, girlfriend, work and the hurt it will cause . I don't want their sympathy I don't want to feel like that again . Any advice . "
It's not like I don't have a will to live. It's just like I have no fear of dying. And it's killing me inside.,"I guess a bit of background would help. I have low self-esteem, usually overshadowed by my cousin, who is far ""better"" to my school's eyes. I was physically abused when I was a kid, and I was a child of a mistress. I'm basically a result of a ruined marriage, and my mom and I leaving my dad left him in deep depression. He still talks to me these days via FB, and it just hurts.These things don't bother that much. Not directly to the point of suicide. And I know I'm better than my cousin in different ways, and that I'm not a mistake, that I'm not defined by my past or my orgins. I just think they, somehow, were the reasons of my self-destructive nature.I don't mind doing reckless things. I have thoughts of jumping off buildings, sometimes literally standing along the ledge. I contemplate cutting my wrists, or grating my hand. Never doing it though. I have thoughts of getting drunk, hitching a ride at night with a stranger, do drugs. Anything to stimulate my mind, I suppose. It's like everything else just bores me to death. I just feel so empty.But the thing I hate the most, the thing that drove me to write this post, about my behavior is how I ruin relationships. I read about self-destructive behavior on the Wikipedia and there was one section that basically described it:""Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that they will ""mess up"" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear, socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior, so that others will reject them first.""And it hit me pretty hard today because I think I just fucked up a relationship with someone I truly liked. My chest aches a lot right now, and it's pretty cheesy. But I have this fear that I'll do it to all that I really care about. I feel like nothing really ever matters, and I should just keep on with this. I feel so safe like this, and like if nothing really matters, nothing can hurt me. I know that this reckless behavior is just a coping mechanism for me.And I think that there's a way to be truly happy without this. I hope for one.I can't rely on parents or friends. They're all avid Christians, and I don't believe in a god. I just don't think religion is necessary for me. So that's why I turned here.Honestly, I would've ended it all now if it wasn't for my mom. She endured my existence and let me live a pretty good life. My death would only be selfish and devastate her.So, has anyone ever felt this? I just want a way out, and I know suicide won't help. But it just seems like the only option right now. I'm so empty."
I have always known I would die by my own hand,"Short version. I am a 54yo female. Abused sexually. physically, and emotionally from age 3-16, multiple actors.  Tried to kill my self for the third time (many previous cries for help) in July.  Cannot get it done. Husband now has memory loss, and am caring for 91yo mother. Have no friends left, and my family has never been there for me.  Husbands friends and family have either died or abandoned us in another way. I also have multiple medical problems, the worst of which are spinal stenosis, and lumbar spondylosis which cause chronic pain for which they will not give me any opiates due to my psych history.  Neither hubby nor I can work, and live on less than $1,700/month on SS disabilityMy psychiatrist, and therapist, have become complacent.  Psych had a fairly good med combo, but it did not keep the last attempt at bay. Therapists is okay, but mostly I think that she is amused by me; not in a bad way though. She just doesn't direct the conversation, or make me work on anything.  Neither suggested hospitalization after this most recent event. They do not know everything about my past, mostly just the light molestation by my stepdad, but everything about my present.My PCP I rarely see, and her NP is virtually useless.  This was not always true, prior to their takeover by a corporate hospital group.  They used to actually listen, but have no time, and their hands are tied as far as options.  They are aware of my attempts, but not my upbringing.I guess I am just tired of trying, and getting it wrong.  First real attempt was when I was 18.  Just married, had an affair with hubbys bff, and realized that leaving my childhood home did not solve all of my problems. Pills and booze, not recognized by anyone as an attempt, so not hospitalized.Second attempt was after the hubby had an affair with our bff, and she said she was pregnant with his baby.  Due to my childhood I cannot have kids, so the pregnancy was the kicker.  That was an attempted asphyxiation. Think those guys they find 'hanging,' but I was not masturbating.This last time I took almost six times the lethal dose of a medication that I am on (not commonly used for suicide) and all I got was two knees bruised so badly that I could not walk for 3 days, and I spent two of those days hallucinating.  Hubby did not even attempt to get me help, and actively tried to talk me out of calling 911.Not normally a whiner, but I am just really frustrated that no matter how much I try to get things right, doing research and such, I am still stuck here.  I do finally have what I assume is a fool proof plan that does not include a gun, since I cannot purchase one legally, and no longer have any connections to get one illegally.  I am also not really looking for any kind of help (living or dying) unless you can give me the winning powerball numbers so I can afford a good nursing home for Mom, and maybe Hubby.  Just looking to get it off my chest, I guess."
If anyone needs help please pm me. I am like you I have problems to,Ye I'm just having a pretty shitty year with school life and other shit. Just need someone to talk
Over,I am going to go over at my aunt's abandoned house and hang myself tomorrow morning.
Does going through with this make me selfish?,"I'm 29, and I intend to do it tomorrow, probably warm water + knife, unless I think of something better and less messy. I feel like a complete piece of shit, and have for 15 years at least now. The only reason it's gonna happen tomorrow is I didn't want to hurt my parents, friends and the poor fuck who will have to clean after me, and now I think I want this too much. I'm not even that sad, it's more like... liberation. And anxiety, maybe, but that's to be expected. Does this make me more selfish than I already am? If someone replies, I'll answer when I'm back from work, I've decided to do my best not to let people around me know, so they don't blame themselves."
Why is suicide consider a bad thing.?,I have lost everything in the last month including friends and my girlfriend. No one seemed to care that I did until I started taking drugs and alcohol. Then everyone calls me selfish and my ex girlfriend kept preventing me from doing it. Why can't I just be left alone.
I don't want to do this anymore,"I'm so tired. I hate waking up every day and being me. Everything is too fucking hard. Going about my day, talking to people, even things I'm supposed to like. If it wasn't for some people that care for me for whatever reason I'd do it right now but now I'm starting to resent my friends and family for being the reason I'm not hanging from somewhere I hate everything and I want to die "
The most loved person of mine..,"So everything started about a month ago when I meet a girl from Portugal. We talked a lot and got to know eachother pretty well. We've been ""together"" for all of that time and it was the best thing that could have happened to me. When I told her that I need about 2 weeks to study she was ok with it. After I passed my exams she made a new friend which she calls ""bae"" . She doesnt even call me like that when with her friends but him? Of course she calls him bae. Whenever I want to talk to her she's in defensive mode and tries to not talk to me by any meaning. When I begged her to speak with me she tried finding excuses and ended up lying me that her phone died. I literally never met someone like her. She's the most perfect person I've ever meet. I've been dealing with depression since 4 years ago when my mom literally died crying for me.. I just wanted someone to love . I offered to pay for her to come in the UK next year and move with me . She agreed but now.. everything is ruined. I can assure you that no other girl is like she is. I wont ever find someone like her . My life literally has no meaning at all right now. What am I supposed to do? She is just hiding stuff and doesnt wanna talk to me. I know she was dealing with depression as much as I was but that doesnt make any sense. The guy looks like just a friend for her but I dont know why she was like that. I told her that im going to kill myself (which i think i will) and she didnt even tried to tell me not to do it. She just ignored me and told me to leave her alone. I was about to commite suicide before I meet her but she gave me a reason to still try . But now .....everything is gone.
There are still alot of things I didnt said about her. There is no chance I would forget her. I just wanna be back with her but I cant do anything :("
"My psychiatrist left me, like everyone else does....","I had my follow up appointment with what is my third psychiatrist in maybe two months and she told me I needed to see someone else because she couldn't help me. I should have known she, too, would get tired of me/reject me/tell me to leave. I made the mistake of being honest with her and telling her about my love addiction. She basically told me what everyone tells me which is that I need to Put Myself First and Stop Dating and blah blah blah. I don't mean to sound like a brat. I'm just so tired of people telling me the same thing. I'm tired of telling myself the same thing. I don't know if I can do this anymore. I'm certifiably crazy. I've been inpatient more than five times, I've been diagnosed and prescribed. I've taken intensive DBT to combat the Big Bad in my life known as Borderline Personality Disorder (something I initially rejected because it sounded more like it should be named Being Human but now embrace as my issue.) I've been around the block, it's not my first rodeo, this is my life now. I cry and oversleep and try to stay alive for the people in my life. I am very fortunate to have a considerable number of people in my life who have said they care deeply about me and want to see me thrive and survive. There are times when I too, want to see myself thrive and survive. But I was say that's 3/10 days. The rest of the time I feel like I can't deal with the crushing weight of just breathing. I'm so torn between killing myself and trying to fight that I think maybe I should have myself permanently committed. That way I can hide from the world but the people who say they love me can still see me if they want. It's compromise. But that costs a lot of money I think, and it's probably not fair to the psychotic people who simply CAN'T function even if they want to. At least I can put on a show when I want to/have to. I'm tethered to reality and have never experienced psychosis which is something I should be grateful for, and on a certain level I really am. But it's not enough. I think that's my issue. It's not enough. There is simply one thing that is enough: love/romance. If I am dating, I am on top of the world. There is a reason to live and a point to it all and I can fight anything and overcome everything. I am euphoric, I am almost invincible and I am probably really fun to be around too. My entire happiness is hinged on my newfound relationship and if/when that goes away, everything (understandably) falls apart. When I tell myself I'm being unreasonable and delete all the apps, block all the numbers and erase all the pictures that's when withdrawal sets in. The empty feeling in my chest (now correctly identified as anxiety, by my last therapist) compounds and I feel as if I am walking with a hundred pound weight attached to my sternum. Every car is an opportunity, every train a potential escape forever. I live in New York City. It's torturous. I have no suicide note, or manifesto. I don't want my failed romances to feel sorry if I die. Honestly, I wish they'd just forget all about me. I don't want anyone to feel pain for the ways they may have wronged me in the past. I am not seeking revenge in any way shape or form. I just want this to end. I literally just want the pain to fucking end. If I didn't feel this awful compulsion and the emptiness that followed denying it, I would be fine. I would be able to deal with my life, I presume. But this is too much. This pain is way too much, nothing has helped, and today has just been proof that it doesn't matter if I beg them, fuck them or pay them, no one will deal with me for very long. My own mother shuts me out and gives me the cold shoulder when it becomes too much. I don't blame her. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I honestly don't know what to do. Please, give me advice on how to die. I've read about short drop hanging and nitrogen. I live in a regular house and the basement is empty. I haven't inspected it much--there might be some good prospects but I'm not really looking at things with an educated eye. Websites can only help so much and they often like to tell you about all the ways you might fail, or try to reverse psychology you some other way. Reddit is cold and practical in many ways, so that's why I've come here. Please help me put an end to this pain. If there's some kind of afterlife, I'll be eternally grateful. "
I'm giving up. I'll be dead in a few weeks.,"I'm way too tired to start writing stuff about myself since no one will read it anyways. Basically I hate people. I think everyone's terrible and that no one has any empathy. I shouldn't be upset over something like this. I should get over it. But I can't do it. It's too much for me.So I'll be dead in a few weeks. I don't really care about my family anyways. I've got no friends obviously. I don't even care if anyone will ""miss me""."
Maybe i should give my parents my suicide for Christmas this year..im sure theyd be thrilled.,They will milk it for the sympathy for years. Don't give them the satisfaction.
can someone dm me on twitter please? i would like to talk,@blank_gengar
I will kill myself soon..just waiting for everything to fall in place..,"me too bro, the pieces will soon fall into place ...whats your story?"
I feel left out of a normal life,I hate hearing about my friends doing something without me. I'm never texted first. I'm noones first option. Ever. I hate not having anyone that cares. I hate that no one would be affected if I just left. I hate being alive. I hate feeling tired all the time. I hate that I need drugs to feel happy. I hate my awful grades. I hate that I'm awkward. I hate that I'm anxious. I hate myself. I want to end my life.
"God is real, and that motherfucker loves irony.","I don't know how it has escaped me for this long, but I just remembered that my state practically doesn't have gun laws. I'm up to my chest in credit card debt, but if I sell some securities, I should be able to afford a gun some ammo. But, of course, my car had to break down just before I came to this realization, so I'm marooned at my college campus. By the time I get this car fixed, I might still feel like doing it. Holy shit, I'm kind of scared. "
A 19 year old worthless loser,"Every day suicidal thoughts get more intense. I can't stand the shame of being so inferior and weak all the time. This is very painful as I'm sure society looks down on young men who are like this. There is nothing positive in my life. I've stopped seeing friends because I'm embarrassed. Honestly, I envy them. They are more intelligent, getting better educations, more sociable, successful and generally better human beings. How can I possibly compete in society? "
Never in my life have i felt humiliated and treated like I'm a piece of trash can I just die already!!!,OMG are you me? You literally sound like me.
TL;DR,"It isn't getting better. The medication isn't helping. I am too alone, alone with my thoughts. Nostalgia stabbing into my heart and twisting the blade. Everything good has already happened for me. Everything I care about, the friends, the jobs, the drugs, it's all in the past now. Nothing ever comes to replace what I've lost, so there is just emptiness where there used to be love, where there used to be distraction. I love my family but I am suffering mentally. I am lost and I am trapped in my life. There is something wrong with my mind, I know it. I have only failed, I do not succeed and I am miserable trying to make sense out of the broken pieces. I'm sick, I'm not well. I present well, at least they tell me so. Say I'm high-functioning. But I am not well. I am sick and there is no cure. On these long nights alone I don't want to fight anymore. I want to give up. I'm not interested in working to have a better life, as I know it won't come, it's all gone gray. It's been almost a decade of therapy and pills and I'm getting old, the doors are closing. I'm just teetering on the edge of collapse. They still believe in me, but I don't believe in myself and I'm so tired of living for them, when there is no joy. When I can't complete the easiest of tasks. When everyday is just waking up to the same shit feelings. Wanting to hide somewhere I feel safe. This pathetic weak little life I'm living.I am so sad because there is no one to tell my thoughts to that matters to my heart. My parents are burnt out from listening to me, my sister ignores me, and everyone else, they never knew me. No one knows who I am, they just know this pathetic sad, bitter, useless man I've become. They didn't ever know the boy I was, the one who believed that things would actually get better if he just tried. The one with all the opportunity. But he was so sick too. Stuck at home suffering from agoraphobia. He should of killed himself then, but he thought he'd get better, because that's what they promise you, that's what they tell you so they can comfort themselves. IT WILL GET BETTER. What if it already got better and now I'm living the post-better life? It got better, then it got so much worse. I'm getting so sick again. I'm losing my mind. They cut my hours back at work and my one friend isn't calling as much anymore. Now I just have idle time to suffer and nothing to self medicate with. I'm so tired of life. My psychiatrist said I want to not exist, not that I want to die. I'm not even sure what that means. I want to die, I want to end ""my life"", the final resolve to everything that has happened, to be at peace with my story.How much longer will it go on?"
lol,"yeah so like my mom passed away like 14 months ago and i moved in with my brother snd stuff and like i got friends but by now they all dirched me and shit. uhh yeah they dont invite me to parties anymore so.. and work has been so tedious and stressful for me so yikes... uh im 16, pretty sport active i guess, been depressed for about 2 years or so now so probs gonna leave in like a week or two"
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I just need to.,"Sometimes I just have thoughts of how nice it would be to just kill myself or be dead. I'm not suffering from depression and compared to all the people who need an ear on this sub, I have a good life, however, like I said, I just would rather be dead 80% of my day. I was wondering why this could be if any of you could help. I don't think I'm suicidal, but I know I'm a huge failure so far in life and knowing that just makes every day feel long and I just want my short life to end already. My question really is just do any of you know what could be bringing on these thoughts? My doctor says I'm not depressed."
I know I shouldn't ask for medical help but...,"Roughly 4/5 days ago I was in hospital for a suicide attempt (overdose) I took 20 225mg Venlafaxine, 24 Valium and a few sleeping pills. All on an empty stomach and with alcohol.
I was discharged from hospital after staying in and being assessed but no-one told me anything. Ever since I've had horrible stomach cramps and I'm constantly feeling sick in the mornings and after food. Is this normal? Thank you.
(Remove if breaking rules) x"
"Christians, is it morally wrong to wish for death? I don't think I could kill myself, as that would be against my faith, but I want to die. Please help. :/","Is it against your faith? It definitely would be considered bad. In some cases as it is an act of intentional killing: murder many scholars believe since you can not ask for redemption on Earth it's simply a way to hell. God will forgive us our sins when we pray to him, and seek redemption. However you can't exactly be sincere about it as you conduct the action. If you really want to be moral and a good Christian than it's simple. Give your life to god. Join the church, or a monastery and become a monk/volunteer. And live your life only for God and no one else. Not even for yourself. "
Tonight's the night,Goodbye. Thank you for everything youve given me. My note is in the top left drawer of my vanity. I love you.
Are there any websites that provide proper guides to easy and painless suicide.,I've been watching a few videos over the last week on youtube about how to tie a noose to hang myself. But I'm not sure if I can do it right. I'd prefer just to painlessly over dose on some combination of drugs really. I tried killing myself by eating peanuts because I was allergic to them but it seems I grew out of my allergy because I didn't get a reaction.
I'm doing it tomorrow.,"I've chosen not to wait anymore. Well technically 1 more night but I probably won't sleep. My note is written and I've sent texts thanking what few friends I have. I just wish there was another way or wish I could see it. But I think I can do it this time. I'm gonna get wasted, get in the car, turn up the radio and carbon dioxide myself to sleep for good.If any of my friends see this... I'm sooo sorry. It's not your fault."
My life is just crumbling.,"I don't have anyone to talk to, so I figured I should come here. I don't know what to do, suicide has been on my mind heavy for weeks(well really for the past ten years). What do you do when you're in your life completely alone? When all you want is to find any way to get fucked up to be numb? All I want to do is die but I'm entirely too chicken to do it myself, so I have to sit miserable hating everything about myself until someone feels bad enough for me to just go ahead & put me out of my misery. I think about it too much. I just want the pain to stop. I need someone to show compassion & love. & Act like it would destroy them to lose me, like it destroys me EVERY TIME. There's always someone more important, when am I going to be the one that matters? I don't know why I'm even trying to look for compassion. I'm sorry."
I want to die.,That is all.
"Yo, am I worthy of living?","So here's the deal, I've been miserable for years now; at least six, but maybe more. In that time, I've tried the usual suspects: exercise, meditation, relationships... it has all kind of amounted to nothing.  Not to say I haven't learned anything from those experiences, but I can't shake this feeling that I will end up killing myself someday no matter what I do. I seem to be stuck in a cycle of Thinking things are about to get betterRealizing things are getting worseIt's like a roller coaster ride that never ends, except instead of being terrified all the time with relief at the end, I drift between debilitating sadness and listless anxiety. I really don't know what to do. It may be easier for me to end my life since there doesn't seem to be a solution. I dunno, I'm not even emotional about dying anymore, I just see it as a logical choice in the face of a really awful world. Hey thanks for reading this far <3"
Endless Loop,"Ill try to tell my story the best way I can, back in March my ex girlfriend ended things with me after nearly 5 years, turns out she cheated and was in love with someone else. A mutual friend, but thats no longer whats causing my struggle. Every single day I wake up worse and worse, it feels like im stuck in an endlesd loop of failures, struggling to climb out of a neverending fall into an abyss of despair. Ive downloaded dating apps, tried relstionships, blew my chance of a hookup with a really cute girl, lately I cant seem to find peace. My mind is constantly being tormented by questions. ""Is this the right choice"" ""Should you do this"" etc. When im not being tormented by questions, im being tormented by my own self hatred, ""look what you fucked up"" ""you're worthless"" ""you blew some great chances, your such a pussy"". Waking up daily to these constant tormenting thoughts has me flying down a path of seriously considering suicide as an option. I really dont want to live and suffer anymore. Nothing seems to go right for me anymore, and Im not sure if I can continue on. Im on medication for anxiety and depression, but even that stopped helping.. I appear to be stuck in an endless loop.. an endless loop of despair snd misery that I cant seem to escape.."
I am no one,"I am 31 years old. I work full time and then some in social services. Typically I work 50 hours a week but I can barely make ends meet. I took a week off in July and without the overtime I took such a financial hit I almost couldn't buy food- and I didn't even do anything or go anywhere, it was literally just a staycation where I mostly played video games or went on walks to the park. I'm 31 with a college degree and I have to get a second job and essentially work 7 days a week so I can save money. I have no life now because I can't afford it. I'll have no life then because I won't have time. And it is an endless cycle. I am tired. I feel heavy. Air hurts. My skin feels raw. And as much as I want to feel guilty, I can only feel at peace in the knowledge that sometime soon I will die and I will be the one to do it. That when it is over everyone else will be sad but eventually they will move on. They'll get on with their lives, and I will no longer be the fuck-up burden they feel obligated to invite places or required to talk to. They won't have me to support financially and emotionally. What I hope to gain is freedom, and I hope to provide it as well. I do not like who I am. I am not happy. I have not been happy for a very long time. I have always been unsuccessful in relationships. I try so many things and can barely rise to mediocrity. And when people say I'm good at something or they like me it just feels like a lie. It feels like they are making fun of me. It always has felt that way. And I'm tired. And I just want to be done now. "
"I hate this city, and I can't move - I feel like I don't have any options","I am an early-20sF living in a dangerous city for grad school. I have about 4 more years in my PhD. This city is terrible. Walking home in the middle of the day today, I stopped at a crosswalk waiting for the light to change. I got pushed and shoved by a sleazy man who started berating me, calling me a wh-re, asking if I am trying to sell myself, said that I must be a cheap wh-re as my ""nails aren't even done"", etc. I said ""Leave me alone!"" and two other men started saying the same things. I immediately turned and walked the other direction as they yelled profanities and screamed at me. There were tons of other people around, and no one said anything to them or even attempted to help me. I can't believe that the mid-30s couple at the same crosswalk didn't say anything. I was on the phone with my mom the entire time. She heard everything.This is not even close to the first time that this has happened. This is not the worst experience I have even had. This kind of encounter with homeless / mentally ill / high people happens at least once a week on public transportation, so this was not a byproduct of walking home. I hate this city. I hate living here. I love my school though. Also, everyone is very proud of me for going here. My parents have told everyone that I am attending grad school here, and they already call me ""Doctor MyLastName"" in a loving way because they are so proud of me. So I can't switch grad schools. I can't move from this hell hole. I tried talking to a therapist. They said something about it just being paranoia, and threatened to take me off a medication for ADHD that I have happily been on for over 6 years because ""it can increase paranoia"". I don't understand how being scared to leave my house is paranoia when at least once a week, someone says something terrible to me or threatens me. I have been mugged twice since I have lived here. I feel like my only other option is killing myself. I could probably just walk home at night with a purse and end up shot within a month to be completely honest. I can't live here anymore. "
"numb, alone and tired of fighting","so...i asked my best friend to let me know when in general to not tell her my mental/emotional/psychological state when she's got something on her mind she told me i passed that point a while ago. i kinda...dont want to live to see my birthday at all now...it's 4 days away and i dont want to be here anymore. i knew everyone else hated me. i could deal with that. but my fucking best friend told me she doesnt have the time or energy to deal with my shit. i've helped her so much in life and i shouldve seen it coming when she didnt put effort into comforting me. i had a couple attempts and she stopped trying to console or help me when i flat out told her my plan. she ignored all of what i suggested and was so stubborn and set on not listening to me, no matter what i said. and now this. im so numb. i cant feel anything anymore. it's like i snapped inside. i literally can't fucking move. my body is in so much pain. i give up. she was my last reason to stay. there's no fucking point anymore. that's gone and i'm tired of fighting it. im ready to fucking die. "
my tinnitus is going to kill me,"hi, I began experiencing a wooshing sound in my ears last Tuesday (aug 28th) that was chalked up to an ear infection. During that time I experienced constant panic attacks, fearing that it was going to last forever. Then 2 days ago I felt so much better because out of nowhere it just vanished. However today it has come back and now i feel more hopeless than ever. If I have to live with this for any longer suicide will just be a matter of time. I saw an ENT and he told me that I was making a ""full recovery"" from the ear infection but lo and behold my wooshing is back and my will to live has vanished.I have so much shit due next week and with this ear thing I just want to die. I have told my boyfriend about my suffering so many times he's tired of hearing it. I told my parents and they said ""I'm sorry honey."" No one actually cares that I want to die. I have been saying things like ""i want to die"" and ""kill me"" I think that they have gotten used to it. Well, joke's on them, because sooner or later I'm going to end up in the fucking dirt."
Help! My GF has considered suicide and self-harm in the past.,"Hey reddit, I have a problem with my girlfriend and for some context, we're both in high school.Last night, my girlfriend asked me if I have ever been suicidal. I have never, but I immediately felt concerned because I knew where the conversation was heading. She revealed to me that she has been suicidal before. I asked if she ever self-harmed and she told me she has considered it. She said that 3 years ago, she felt alone, she had a pair of scissors, and was thinking about stabbing herself in the stomach at the moment. When she told me this I just gave her a big hug and told her that she can always talk somebody and she could talk to me if she ever needed to. I honestly didn't know what else to say because we were out on a date and I didn't want to upset her by saying something she might not like. Even now as I write this, I recall her telling me that when she was in elementary, she threatened her schoolmates that were bullying her that she would kill herself. At the time when she told me this, I was shocked, but rationalized in my mind that she was probably lying so her bullies would back off. She said it in a kind of laughing tone and I assumed (stupidly) that she was all right. She exhibits some signs of depression. She asked me if my parents hated her after they met her and she has a pretty low image of her body.This is where I need some advice. I really want to help her out because I really, really like her and would never leave her because of something like this. I've been reading some of the stuff on  but I'm not sure when/how to approach the subject. Do I just wait for her to bring this up again or should I offer her a chance to talk to me more about this before something serious ever happens? Thanks in advance."
I'm unwanted and I don't want to live in a world where no one wants me,"I'm in college. I went through sorority rush and didn't get in any sororities. So I tried to apply to join another organization on campus, and got turned away from that too. I don't belong anywhere. My mom is extremely emotionally abusive. The day I got turned away from that organization, my grandma died. I was extremely close to her and loved her a lot. Now my mom is telling me how I wasn't important to her. My boyfriend never tries to take me on dates and barely makes any effort to even see me. We have been together 5 years. I constantly tell him how I feel neglected and unwanted, and he continues to ignore me and neglect me. I don't have a best friend. People that I thought were my friends hang out with each other and never invite me. I'm just never wanted by anyone. I want to be someone's best friend. I want to be someone's first choice or any choice at all. I don't understand why nobody likes me. I am so nice to people. I really want to make friends but no one likes me."
The police make me suicidal.,To make a long short story. I'm not getting justice from them when people wrong me. Instead locked up and sent to a mental hospital when family members physically abuse me.I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.Why am I not getting justice?
All time low,"I think I've hit rock bottom in my life, I have IBS paired with numerous food allergies(gluten, dairy, sunflower oil) and chemical sensitives to about anything you can imagine(can't use toothpaste, can't drink anything except for DISTILLED WATER). I have a mass growing in my testicles. I've dealt with going to the bathroom 10-20 times a day for as long as I can remember (I'm 22). It is so raw down in there 5/7 days of the week making it so uncomfortable to even walk around at my job. Chronic General and social anxiety because of being so uncomfortable and constipated and in pain all day has developed because of being in the public school system (caused by IBS). I am successful outside of that, but I'm just miserable and there are no real explanations to my health issues. I've been at lows, but this is an all time and I'm afraid I'm going to act soon. But I'm assuming I should invest in life insurance? I know it doesn't payout when you commit suicide. "
My marriage is slipping away,"Sorry if it's too long, although I've omitted a few things just for brevity, and it's 3 AM now so there might some grammatical errors.I've been married to my wife for 12 years, we had some ups and downs, but somehow we kept on going, although the older I get the more worried I am about what the future hold for us, I'm really scared that everything will fall apart eventually.She was my first love, I met her when she was 19 and I was 21, and I honestly had never met somebody who is better than her, she is a caring and beautiful girl.When we were in our 20s, our marriage seemed like a never-ending adventure, we were blessed by the arrival of our beautiful daughter, that was the happiest day of my life and followed by a large job offer, to be honest, to this day I still don't think I deserved it, but back then I believed that we were going in to the right direction, our parents were so proud, and I thought that someday we're going to have a house, our daughter will have her own room, and my career will be brilliant.But once I turned 30, I realized that all the luck that I once had, had never returned. My career turned sour, although people appreciated and praised my work I had never gotten the promotion nor the financial reward that I always wanted, we weren't poor, but we weren't exactly rich either, the only thing that I could afford was a 1-bed room apartment.As I grew older, it seems obvious that nothing will change, and thus began my first midlife crisis. I was feeling helpless and depressed, and amidst all the chaos, I met an interesting girl in my office, we came from two different cultures, hence interacting with her gave me something fresh, and the needed distraction.She knew I was married but nonetheless still pursued my attention, so we grew closer, although my relationship with her had never gone beyond emotional, my wife was furious and devastated when she founds out about it, she even hit me a couple of times.Afterwards, we both had gone insane, our communication had never been perfect, so it had put our marriage to the test, I even blurted out that I'll divorce her, we were constantly arguing, and during that period, my wife was depressed and mentally broken, until, I realized that I was a selfish-man and I still love her just as the day I met her, so I eventually let the other girl go and I bought her a ring, and re-proposed to her again, apologized profusely, she cried and I promised that I'll never do that again to her.Our marriage was saved but my career was still in the gutter until I got another offer, the offer wasn't great, and my wife resented it, but I thought it could be a stepping-stone for my career plus I knew if we had stayed nothing good will happen to us, the prices were increasing yet my salary stayed the same.The offer was in another country, so we packed our bags and left all the memories behind, hoping things will change, but once I started the job, I came to the realization that things weren't better ���some things were worse and some were better��� but in general, it was the same, plus I had to struggle with a completely new language, even though in the interview my boss had convinced me that it was not going to be an issue, but apparently he was lying.My depression worsens after 1 year, nothing has changed we were still living in a one room bed apartment, and on top of that my wife had a miscarriage and we have been expecting for another child for years.At this point I knew nothing will change, I started crying alone twice a week, or was sleeping at random places like some homeless guy, even had suicidal thoughts ���weren't for my daughter I would've had done it 2 years ago��� and I started to complain about my work every day to my wife, I was very negative, then after a few years, she told me she couldn't take my negativity anymore and told me that if I kept on going she will leave me, so I stopped, but now I'm imploding because I don't have any venue to share my frustration anymore.5 months ago I got another job, it was slightly better than the previous job, albeit, with more or less the same problem, and yet with another sacrifice, I have to live in another city, so I could only see my daughter once a month.I'm 38 now, in 2 years I'll be 40, looking back at my career, it hasn't changed since the day my daughter was born and that was 10 years ago, some of my friends have become high ranking employees, or owned their own companies, while I still living in a one-bed room apartment.Now all of my colleagues are in their late 20s, they are all young, smart, speak 2-3 languages, and ambitious and can work far longer than I do, I don't know if I can keep up with this anymore, a month ago my wife confessed that she hasn't gotten over the fact that I had had an emotional relationship with another woman, and she said she still remembers the pain. I felt that our marriage wasn't as beautiful as it once was, in fact, it's slipping.I had a severe panic attack a couple of days ago which I almost fainted, my heart was racing, I was profusely sweating, I felt tingling all over my body, I was alone, nobody was beside me, my family was 200 miles away, I thought that was it, all the struggle and the sacrifices that I made had been nothing, I didn't tell my wife about this.I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I really love my wife, but I'm tired, I honestly wish I could go home or just commit suicide so at least my family can get the insurance money.tl;dr: Having a midlife crisis, career is a dead, marriage is slipping away."
I think I'm jinxed.,Too much bad luck my way.Didn't do anything wrong.Used to being treated poorly.I cut off just about everyone because I feel people don't tke me seriously enough.
Everyone loses interest in me eventually,"I have literally no one. My birthday is in less than two weeks, I plan on hanging myself a week after. I have literally nothing to live for. I've never been this depressed for such an extended period of time . The worst part is that nothing is helping me. I've been depressed for the last 11 years of my life (since I was 13). Therapy didn't help. Medicine didn't help. People who I thought were my friends deserted me. My family doesn't want to have anything to do with me. I'm suffering so fucking much. I'm just barely surviving day after day. My depression is untreatable and I just want my shitty life to end already."
I'm going to kill myself on Monday.,"My loneliness is to the point that I have no optimism. I can't find a relationship and when I do they end in heartbreak. I have no patience to wait for one. I have depression, social anxiety, and I get angry with people easily. If I kill myself I won't have to live this painful life any longer. It's not my fault that everyone else is so full of themselves and immature that they don't respect me. If I leave, maybe they'll realize what they missed out on. I want them to be sad. I want them to cry. They deserve it for every thing they've done to me. Or, for every time they ignored, purposely or not - my pain.They'll cry about how they miss me but they're all liars. They denied my requests for relationships and now I get to leave them permanently. They deserve every ounce of guilt they'll feel. I messaged them all suicide letters or cryptic goodbyes and told them just how guilty they are. Only a few are spamming my inboxes, begging me to stop.Funny how they didn't message me before, though. They didn't message me to ask how my night was going, or my plans for the weekend. They ignored me because I'm fucking worthless to them. So now they deserve to live with my ending on their guilty conscious. Why shouldn't I kill myself? I haven't tried therapy or filling myself with artificial toxic pills yet, are those two any good?"
Give me one reason I shouldn't kill myself soon.,"I'm sick of struggling through everyday without any social interaction and having all these regrets pile up. I'm a weird and stupid person, I honestly don't think I'm going to make it to College. :(I'm going to cry myself to sleep rn for the millionth time..."
I think I'm done,There is a lot to write. I'll make this short as possible. I'm 31 M. I'm a combat vet with multiple tours. Found my father after he committed suicided. Ruined my marriage. I've felt emotionally numb for years. All I feel is anger and sadness. I can't change the way I feel. I'm looking forward to dying. It makes me happy thinking about it. I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm the cause of my own ruin. I'm not a good person what so ever.
My friend is suicidal and I don't know how to help her,"I recently started talking to someone one online and as it turns out she is severely depressed and suicidal. She has told me that she is planning to kill herself after she finished school. I live in a different country to her so I can not go to her to help. She has said that a lot of her friends have left or betrayed her and she is unable to trust anyone anymore. I am trying my best to help her, but she keeps going between wanting to be helped and not wanting to be helped. Every time I think I convinced her to get help she just changes her mind a few minutes later and decides she just wants to die instead.I really don't know what else to do here. I have read some things that are in the side bar but I don't think that I am helping her. I just don't know what do say or do! Please help me help her! I am so scared that she will kill herself and it will be my fault that I couldn't help her!"
I hate myself & I want to die,"I am fat, pathetic, & disgusting. I'm dumb and and idiot. I'm a cunt. And I need to stop liking the things I like. Because their stupid & disgusting. I'm a pervert and a paedophile racist. And homophobic. I know this because the voices tell me so. I just need to work. I'm a female 16 year old, I don't know how to drive and I have no friends. I'm fat so I'm ugly & disease ridden. I am fat & disgusting. No matter how much I try to be happy & push away the voices. They always come back. Because I know I'm a pathetic piece of garbage. I hate my annoying white sounding voice. And I'm just going to kill myself."
I don't want to live as an inferior human anymore.,"Hey guys and gals, I really need a place to get this off my chest so here it goes:Im currently 23, turning 24 in January. This summer I was bed bound for the whole of the summer due to brain injury.
This accident happened, as I was getting my life back on track. Giving it all at uni, doing sports as much as my knees allowed me to, and trying to get to know more people.
All of this was an effort, to change my life from being a hermit with poor social skills and low ambitions. I spend my years at uni getting fat and hiding from other people and work.
Although I got rid of the fat now, I still have strech marks all over the place. This and my not-as-good-as-it-used-to-be physique due knee problems, which won't fucking go away, add to my inferiority complex.
I feel I have failed life to the core, wasted on of the most important years in the life of a succesful human being, and the milestones I missed I cannot do over. Even if I try to turn it around again, which I was semi succesful the last year before my accident, it just seems to me, that this mistakes will stain my very being forever.  I can be better than now in the future, but the fucking past cannot change, and that is what makes me want to kill myself so so bad. I really think I cannot get as far in life as I could have, because of the lower brain processing power as I got older now(I get a lot of shit for saying this at home, but I really think this is true). This mistakes aren't even reversible, like my stretchmarks, I would have to live with their consequences all my life long, maybe getting equal in (relative, as I cannot undo my isolation) experience with my peers in the thirties, but that wouldn't matter, because I cannot be happy there if I wasn't happy in my early 20s right?I still try to change at the moment, as im recovering, because I have to choices, giving it all or killing myself. But really, I like the second option so much better at the moment, for I cannot stand being inferior, even if it may be just in my mind."
I dont know what to say,"I want to kill myself, like today or tomorrow. I'm tired of feeling so shitty. Nobody cares about me and I'm not good at anything. I need someone to be there for me because I'm pretty sure I'll actually do it. "
Sexual repression is ruining me,"I've always been considered a creep, ugly, weird, ''unworthy'', loser, I doubt I will ever have someone I connect with and who connects with me, it's killing me, I'm frustrated, I'm angry.I've been in professional therapy for depression for 4+ years, it lead nowhere, and even made things worse. I've never knew how to express what was bothering me so much, and I cannot stress enough how much I hate talking about it, it makes me feel so bad about myself, I've never had positive experiences with the other sex, and as much as I hate it and frustrated by it, there is nothing I can do about it.I've considered suicide many times, and each day it seems I want it even more, I know that I will suicide soon, I don't want to, but I just don't want to suffer this anymore."
3rd try... maybe today,"Im fed up with my life now. I have depressions for 4 years now and i cant stand it anymore. My girlfriend (we were Engaged) commited suicide, some of my best friends died... i nearly lost everything. I did terrible things in my job. I got a serious Problem with my heart. Doctors say that i have left a few years to live. I tried to end this 2 times now but it didnt work... "
Unhappy with my job,"Working at a wholesale club for 3 years now. I started this job while enrolled in college. Now I dropped out and feel an underlying need to get out of retail as it is sucking the life out of me. Lately, i have been have anxiety attacks, losing my weight and my appetite and just un happy with my job. My brother has an opening at a car wash where he details cars for $2 less than me. But detailing cars is my hobby. I see the pros to this job as:An attempt to get out of my situation before something bad happens, outside job, tips, detail experience, and I can tell people to go up there and charge half of what the wash does and management is ok with it, pays $800 a semester if I go to school. Cons: Less pay, and business depends on weather. I believe my finances will be ok since my rent and bills equal to around $600 soom to be 800. Just need some advice before my anxiety kills me"
My ex called me.,"She proposed, promised for better or for worse, then broke up with me when the worst came. Now she's calling me because she's sad. She's sad? I've never been this depressed in my life. I've never actually had a plan for death. I know exactly how many pills to take to end it all. I know the high traffic times on the busiest road in my city. I know which bridges I can gain access to and how far I would fall. She's sad and I'm lost. Isn't that just lovely? "
"Compulsive liar back with an update. Thank you, Reddit.","Hi. I posted a few days ago, from the roof of a nearby building. It was raining. I was prepared to end it. I reached out for help, and I received it. I met one of the greatest people I've met in a long time, and I've only known him a day or two. Thank you, Reddit. So much. I may not be here for long, but I'm here at least one more day. "
Suicide prevention,My Empty Record Message
Can't get over the past,My brother is 5 years older then me and when I was 13 I had a girl friend and she cheated on me with him and I can't get over it I'm 21 now it fills like it was yesterday they took everything from me friends family my school life was hell even the teachers thought it was funny they where a lot more popular then I was I was like 267 pounds and now I'm 146 I use the anger from that day to drive me to this point but it still hurts I haven't brought a girl home since I know I'm just being a pussy but I don't think I can handle it if it happens again I can't trust no one and its killing my life with people I care a lot about help me plz talk me though it
Not very interesting,"Hi. So this is my first Reddit post and it's not gonna be a very happy one.
I'm like, crazy sad right now. Very lonely and feel completely worthless. I started uni last year and had to drop out for mental health reasons and now I'm living back in London on my own with a really shitty waitressing job and I've been lying flat on my kitchen floor for about an hour trying to muster up the courage to do anything. I hate myself for dropping out, all my friends stayed on at uni and are making successes of themselves and have friends and a social life and all I do is go to work, go home, drink and smoke. I've got a mildly tragic backstory and a history of depression etc but I won't bore everyone with thatI don't even know where I'm going with this. Sorry.I guess I'm just looking for a tiny bit of hope? I just kind of need someone to tell me that stuff might be okay and I'm not going to be stuck here like this forever"
what do I do,"Wtf do I do when nothing makes me happy anymore? Gaming, going outside, being with friends and family, all of these things kept me going, but now all of them feel like chores. When my depression has taken over and nothing is making me happy then wtf do I do?"
It feels as if no one cares..,"I'm (f17) depressed.. anxious.. and suicidal. I'm a senior and I can barely make it through the days at school. I can't stand it. Everyday is filled with pain that comes with the anxiety. I feel ashamed, worthless, pathetic. My parents know about my anxiety problems. Nothing is really done about it.. but this depression.. I haven't told them about. My father would straight up tell me I'm not depressed. That I'm acting stupid. And my mother would just stand there not saying anything. When I look around. Know one really cares about anyone. These teachers that walk around, the doctors I see. None of them actually care. They're just doing a job for the sake of money. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I got tied up in a relationship before these severe thoughts came.    Suicide to me is freeing everyone including myself. I can only see my life in a negative light. I can't get any help. I'm lost, no one is around me. My boyfriend.. it's online.. he's hundreds of miles away.. I promised him I wouldn't commit suicide. So I'm stuck here in pain because I don't want to cause him painYou'd think after going through so much pain for so long you'd grow numb to it. But you don't. You just suffer and suffer. "
I'm trapped...,"Each day, I'm having a hard time justifying my own existence, why I should even bother rolling out of bed in the morning.Collectively, in my household, we have way too many bills piling up and nowhere near enough money. We barely have 2 pennies to rub together, it seems. I do have a job, but it's like a hair above minimum wage and soul-crushing as all hell. My free time is basically spent helping another family member pursue a dream, a dream that I'm less & less convinced will actually come true. I feel like I'm trapped and have nowhere to run or go to. I feel so fucking alone, like I'm suffocating. I don't know what else to do except end it. I feel like there's no real way out."
How to die,What would an overdose of oxycodone do to me?
I think I've come to terms that my life will always be miserable,"I'm a worthless loser that will never get a girlfriend. It eats me alive. I've heard the whole ""you gotta be happy with yourself before you can be happy with somebody else"" spiel many times before. I've tried a lot to just focus on me and it doesn't get rid of the pain of not having a girlfriend. It's obvious to me that I'll never be able to accept no matter what I do. So no matter what you say, I'm not going to believe the whole learn to love myself thing. It truly feels like that my destiny in life was to be nothing but suffering. I've suffered for years cause of this, I've been molded by it. I don't try with girls anymore, I know its a waste of my time. My life's going to be shit, so whats the point in keeping on going?"
Just a dead end fuck.,"That is what I am. No matter how hard I try or what I achieve, death still seems convincing and I would not hesitate to shoot myself in the heart if I found a gun. I cannot change my mental state since misanthropy and antinatalism is the truth. I hate humanity, the system, fucking everything. Fuck the bullshit permanent solution to a temporary problem. Existence is my problem. It is stupid that I exist to make my family happy. I do not have free will. I am born by chance and am just another parasite like everyone else. Non existence is freedom because there is nothing to look forward to. No more enslavement by others nor being commanded like some dog. Life is nothing more but being a puppet on strings. You cannot suffer, feel pain, starve, or even hurt when you never existed. That to me is freedom. I will get there someday."
"I want help, but I'm a minor and can't trust my parents to get it.","I've made multiple posts here and on , and I've decided I want to seek a therapist. As a quick recap, I'm 12 years old, hate public school (I was once homeschooled), think my Mom is horrible at raising children with autism, am 80% sure I have bipolar, and nearly jumped off a wall last week. The only problem is, I don't really have someone I can open up to. Most of the time when I try to talk to my parents about serious matters, I just get yelled at. ""How dare you be suicidal, Jesus died so that you can live, and to kill yourself would be to downright reject that gift. Committing suicide is the most selfish thing you can do!"". And when I try to share my side, they just nuke the conversation. And because my school is an online school, I can't seek help from a school counselor. I can't call the suicide hotline because I don't have a phone. I'm lost, hopeless, and alone..."

Just can't handle the anxiety and depression any more.,My anxiety is so bad that it is nearly crippling. I actually felt good last night after so long and I thought I was making some progress. New meds. Lost a little weight. Cut back on drinking. I went to bed last night and I said I was going to have a good day off. Woke up at six with the anxiety back full force. Felt like I was going to vomit. I'm so tired of living like this. I just wish I was single with no kids some times so I could just kill myself and not feel this way anymore. I can't though because I'm afraid of what it would do to my family.
My suicide would be justified because of the ways I've hurt the people closest to me,"We were just 18 years old and I was a selfish and jealous boyfriend. I never laid a finger on her but the emotional pain and manipulation I inflicted upon her was clear. I was a troll, I was a person who felt underappreciated by everyone around me, and I turned these feelings into acts of provocation and a boundless sense of entitlement. Flash forward five years later, we have graduated college and we are still together. We moved across the country together. I have matured, I've gained insights about the world around me, the struggles of people less fortunate than me, and I would like to think that I have become a more empathetic person. I have realized I am not the center of the universe. The past is all behind us. she tells me that the past doesn't matter because I have changed into a better person. She thinks the early conflict of our relationship was almost a good thing, because it sparked such a significant change in my personality. She loves me, and I love her, and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have her in my life. But none of that changes the fact that I am still haunted by the things I've said and done in the past. Haunted by the person I was in the early days of our relationship, how unfathomably selfish I was, how I could say and do such vile things to the person who I love more than anything in the world. She says I need to stop punishing myself for what I've said and done in the past, because all that matters is that I am a good person going forward. but I think this is what I deserve. This pain that I am writing about is my punishment and I have finally realized it. I'm not a criminal and I'm not a violent person, but I still am unable to eat because of a fixation on the past. Why doesn't her forgiveness satisfy me? Why do I still feel worthless because of the mean things I did when I was barely a legal adult? Why hasn't the slate wiped itself clean yet!!! What do I have to do?I just know that if I were to leave this earth it would be justifiable, as I would never be able to inflict emotional trauma onto another sweet caring person. One reason that I haven't done it yet is because I know that if I were ever to commit suicide it would give her the same type of emotional trauma that haunts me almost every day, and I could never condone that type of action on the person I love most. So I guess I am now forced into a life plagued with guilt, where I will always have to live with the memories of what a jerk I used to be half a decade ago. A life where the high point of my week is embarrassing myself in front of my therapist with incoherent rambling like the kind you're reading right now. A life where I take my pills every morning with the futile hope that maybe one day I might not have to feel this way anymore "
Wondering why life is worth living.,"I have not been diagnosed with depression nor do I think I have depression despite the thoughts I'm having however I think my thoughts would be suitable to post in this subreddit since these are the types of things you guys talk about often. I haven't been hating life, but I see no point in it. Everyone arounds me preaches the gift of life but I don't see how it has any value and death is extremely desirable for me. No more worrying or working or feeling bored or feeling sad; just nothing. I suppose you could consider it ultimate laziness but I see no shame in that. I fantasize about death and committing suicide on a regular basis. I'd just be interested in hearing other people's opinions as to why life has any reason to continue it. (Living so that I can make others happier doesn't count.) P.S. A lot of you might recommend that I see a therapist but I've gone over the rules and the law of confidentiality doesn't apply for expressing suicidal thoughts and I don't want my family to be contacted nor do I want to be ""hospitalised"" as they phrase it."
19 y/o suicidal girl,i don't want to spend 77 years of life battling a cycle of depression and anxiety. i just don't wanna be here anymore.
The conclusion of me.,"The silence is loud. Louder than anything Ive ever heard. It pierces my ears and impregnates my mind. It tells me about myself. I drown it out with the loudest, angriest music I know. I dont know if I feel emotion anymore. I search for the disgusting and disturbing, to prod my heart. I want it to beat again. I want to feel the warmth of my blood, flowing through my veins. It works for a short period, but Im slowly becoming desensitized. I shock myself with my own thoughts. If the inner workings of my mind are a representation of my soul, then I am malevolent. I crave violence and hatred. I wish I was more hated than I am, because then maybe these feelings would be justified, but Im loved by all who meet me. I hate being loved. I deserve nothing and no one. To my daughter, Esli. If your mother loves you at all, she will find someone worthy of your love and hers, and she will omit me from your past. I never deserved either of you. Ive already missed most of your life because of work at this point. I wish I could see you go to your first day of school. Words dont do justice to the amount of love I have for you and your brother.To my son, Bronson. Youre not old enough to know me, which is fortunate for you. Im sorry I will never be there to teach you about life or sports or girls. You deserve a much better father than I could ever be. Your first birthday will be about the time Im supposed to come home from this deployment. I only got you for a month, but every second was worth holding you and your sister and seeing you both smile and laugh. I love you an unfathomable amount.To my wife, Kristen. I took your youth away from you by starting a family with you when we were seventeen and eighteen and making you believe that I was normal for years. The three years we've been married, were the only times in my life that I felt anything remotely close to happiness. This sickness has haunted me since I was a child, and I desperately wanted to be a normal, happy person, but Im too disgusting to deserve that. I want you to know that nothing I feel is your fault, nor the kids fault. Its just the cards Ive been delt. I want you to find someone who will make you happy, because you deserve to be happy with someone who is genuinly happy and will dance with you and will be there for the kids, instead of being gone for for several months or even a year at a time. Nothing I could ever do could make me deserve you; any of you. The guilt I feel for leaving you with a three year old and a six month old may be enough to kill me, before I can. Whatever love Ive ever felt has been for you three. "
I've given up. Again.,"Two nights ago, I went home after midnigh, took a pair of scissors and cut off most of my hair (kids, never try this. It looks awful. I went to the barber the next morning 'cause I sucked at cutting my own hair) It was stupid. Me and my friends were all happy but then I just felt lost. I just suddenly felt that lack of control over my life. Suddenly all my bad memories came back like a tidal wave crashing down on me and the whole world felt so loud to me. And that's when I took my scissors and cut away. Three months ago I already decided to cut myself off from all my friends, because all I ever cause the people around me is heartaches, sadness, and wory. I keep messing up. I just want to cut it all off, cut myself off from this world so that it could me send me into the bin I was meant to be in. I'm just going to try one more time, to end it all before the year ends. I've got my eyes set on an exit to finally end this unending cycle. "
"I don't want to die, but I think I need to.","I've fucked up so much. I screwed up my studies and I don't think I'll ever graduate college because I keep failing classes. I hate my major, I feel like its the hardest major in the school and I should've switched out when I could have. I know my parents love me, but they've pretty much given up on me. They think I'm a compulsive liar, which I might be who knows. And they still don't know that I'm not graduating in May. I also have a lot of friends who care about me and I know killing myself will make them all miserable and potentially screw up their lives which is why I don't want to. I want to get a job and get married and have kids and die happily old.
What I want is to be able to get a well paying job without a degree but I don't think that's possible. What I want is to run away and figure my way through life but I can't live with myself disappointing my loved ones.
Which is why I need to die.
I often find myself wishing that I would die in a car accident or develop a disease like cancer, but that's not going to happen.I haven't picked when yet, I want to be able to tie up all the loose ends to make it as easy as possible. But I know nothing will make it easier for them. "
home alone and contemplating killing myself,"I think about killing myself or dying in some accident or getting a terminal illness every day. I take the stairs when I'm at my school(I have a class on the 4th floor), i want to go all the way to the top, and jump off. I just feel so hopeless and misunderstood by my family and my boyfriend. I'm disgusted with the way I look, to the point of feeling sick whenever I look in the mirror and I don't take pictures of myself like the average person nowadays. I wish I was brave enough to get it over with. I'm 19-I don't have a job, my own place, a car, and I don't know how to drive. I'm a piece of shit. "
I can't trust my family and i have no one to talk about my problems.,"I was raised mostly by my grandparents,all of my childhood is linked to them.My father was always kinda harsh to me,and we had many problems.I tried to help out my father whenever i had the chance,any type of help.Sometimes i helped only to win his favor.I tried to be the perfect son,i salute all my neighbors,i'm always polite and all(i learned that from my GP).But still,i can't make my father to help me with my daily stuff,or just to listen for a few seconds.He can't give me any kind of attention,he usually prefers to play  games on his phone.
  He owed my GPs some money and he didn't gave it back since this night,when i spoke with Grandma about my problems with him.My GM also,had problems with him.I think she is not ok though,she is a little bit unstable .Bc I told her,she got so upset that she felt very ill and called my father.I don't know very much from the conversation,but somehow my father payed his debt to her.
  But now he is madly upset to me,repeating words from our past clashes,mostly insults(no need for bad words).He always made me feel like i was nothing,like i was his biggest shame .He praised me only when i did what he wanted.Oh,and always made jokes about me in the front of his and my friends.
  Now i know that i can't trust my GPs bc they always told my father about my complaints and so on.I can't speak with my GPs,bc they are likely to speak with my father(my father is my main problem).The thing is,that my father always mistreated me and i always tried to love him,but i can't continue with this.I don't have any friends or other support.I feel like i'm all alone,and everything goes so bad that it buries me alive.I don't know if i want to live anymore bc i have nothing left,no family ,no friends.Only an asshole father who disappointed,lied and even tricked me in every way,on a daily basis for 18 years .He is the ruin of my life,my friend and my enemy."
Every passing day I feel more and more like her retirement plan than her son.,"I'm done, I don't want to die I just want to not exist. I'm tired of being manipulated, emotionally abused, and not being respected. I'm held back from leaving because they say how can I leave family, but I can't do it anymore. It's everyday I think about now, the thoughts get harder and harder to avoid. I don't know what to do with myself anymore."
Not sure what to do. Mind all over the place,"Sorry if this thread is all over the place i'm just really not sure what to do... I really hate my life. I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety but have to put on a fake smile everyday for family. Recently everyday I have thoughts of suicide but have never been able to actually bring myself to do it. I guess I feel a bit guilty as both my parents have been diagnosed with cancer and I don't feel I have a right to end my life. My dad had bowel cancer from Mid 2016 but has had surgery and is doing well. We then found out Jan 2016 that my mum had leukemia and is currently still going through treatment but is doing good.This however is not when my depression began, I was sexually abused as a child in another country (my family used to go once every few years) by my cousin on multiple occasions and ended up hating going to the country but to this day I have not told my parents why.
I was then bullied everyday in school for 5 years. I dreaded going on lunch breaks...sometimes I used to go to the library and pretend to read books just so that I could stay somewhere I wouldn't be punched or kicked.   After finishing uni, I started an IT job which I liked at the beginning but 2 years later the job turned crap and I vowed to leave for a better job. This was the time I had found out my mum had cancer too and I quit my job to care for her and my dad but they were not too happy as they'd rather I worked that sit at home (This was about May 2017). I decided to look for another job in August 2017 and found another job but I absolutely hate it. I don't really want to quit it as I've just started and want to give it a chance. I have been to the doctors about my depression and they gave me a different anti depressants to try which worked, but in early 2017 I decided to stop taking them as I didn't want to rely on medication my whole life. They referred me to a psychology team but as I had to arrange for an appointment myself I just couldn't bring myself to it as I feel embarrassed and ashamed to talk about my past life.I don't really have any best friends to talk to deeply about this as they either do not know what to say, they think i'm lying about being depressed or they say you should talk to someone. I've rambled on but I just don't know why I really really do not like my life. I have thought about ways to kill myself but just cannot do it. I'm scared.  "
I just don't feel like living really.,"Things are kinda grey and unexciting. I can sometimes imagine a good life like I can imagine the life of some celebrity. Distant, not mine, but there somehow. It used to bother me that I couldn't access it. That nothing excites me anymore. It feels like I'm dragging it out, like I played the game and now I scroll back and forth in the credits-list. I know that there's a lot I haven't seen or experienced, but it feels like it's not for me. It didn't use to be like that. There was a time when I was genuinely excited and exciting, where I was in awe of what was in front of me and I was willing to struggle for it, even though the world looked grey to me. Friends told me that talking to me was like dreaming, how much they loved me etc. Now, I can't bear to see them, because I bore them to death. I don't have anything to say to them. There's nothing I want to share with them and nothing I want to hear from them. I got really good at listening, and that's what I can do. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't even talk to myself. I don't have any hopes, any dreams left. Sure, I have goals, but I don't care about them anymore. Still, all of this feels wrong. When I met my step-grandfather, lying fragily on his bed, mustering whatever he still had inside of him that his parkinson hadn't destroyed yet to talk to me.. which he didn't even do when his own children or anyone else came to see him.. it felt like he passed on his torch to me. Like he knew what I was capable of and believed in me in a way that makes me a fundamental character in a story to be told. I'd end it immediately, if it wasn't for the feeling that I'm missing something, that I didn't connect the dots on something that would be my purpose, that echoes every so softly deep inside me somewhere. Even though I don't feel it. I don't know. I just don't feel, really. "
I'm not okay...,I'm done trying...
"I have no meaning in my life, no friends and no hopes for a better future..","Started uni this fall and it's really stressful and I have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me. I really like the subject but it's just not worth the effort. I think I expected too much going in to this. I thought I was going to meet people who were like me. I guess I forgot that even if those people existed I wouldn't get along because I barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions. (In middle school people harassed me whenever I said anything so I gradually got quieter and quieter till I just didn't say anything. And I haven't really ""recovered"" from that, I've basically been socially isolated till now.) I've been struggling for a long time and it's a miracle I managed to move to start uni. I feel like this is where it ends though. I'm so close to giving up.I don't think my life has ever felt worth living for. I've always escaped into fantasies about things being good. It's lead me to make poor decisions chasing weird fantasies. I've realized this now though and I'm trying to spot when I have them but I don't dare to dream about things anymore. I want a nice car and house but that's not going to fix anything. I think what I need is to better myself so that I can have healthy and meaningful relationships and a source of income. It's just so difficult and I honestly just want to end it. I'm so tired of life."
Life Insurance,Does anyone know if I can take a life insurance policy out on myself and leave the proceeds to a family member after I go?
Bad people exist.,"And I'm really not convinced that I should stay.I'm pushing people away,slowly but deliberately.I enjoy being a jerk.I'm not even sorry.I'm pissed when people tell me I'm not a bad person because that's the rep I am working for.When they tell me I shouldn't kill myself because of it.I mean,I'm NOT killing myself because of that but it's not a valid reason to die to all these life addicted brainwashed fucks.I'm pissed when they tell me I can change for better because I don't want to.Good people,nice people get on my nerves so much!I'm pissed when people try to stay. Right now the last friend speaking to me isn't responding and God I'm hoping she realized what douchebag I am and left.They call me toxic,abusive and guess what? It's like I've been awarded.An ex-friend recently posted a journal about what I did to them and everyone in the comments telling them they're glad they're done with me made me feel satisfied.I've broken the law and god did I enjoy it,it was the best feeling in my life,uncontrollable glee knowing that someone will be so pissed about me doing this.I enjoy destroying myself,be it alchohol,drugs,self harm...The satisfaction of knowing I destroyed another part of this life and body is great.Stop fucking justifying bad people,you idiots,bad people exist and they know what they are.We're not lost souls that need your help to become pathetic little goody two shoes shits."
I hate my life. And it's not that I feel sad,"It's that I feel nothing. I feel like the empty shell of a person. How I wish I could feel something. That I wish I could even feel sad. But I feel nothing. The only reason I ever really talk to my boyfriend now is to feel sad because at least he makes me feel something. It feels like he doesn't love me anymore and he doesn't want to be with me. Who would ever want to be? But I'm still so in love with him and the feeling that he doesn't love me back makes me feel pain. At least it's something. I just want him to hold me, admire me, do something to show I matter to him. But I don't get that. Just emptiness. Sometimes being around my mom helps. I don't have to say anything about how I feel but she knows when I need her. It must be some sixth sense. She'll cook me a warm meal, take me shopping, do whatever it is to see me feel even a bit more full. I don't trust anyone, not even my boyfriend. I feel like I'll be judged or brushed off. Whenever I try and say something it feels like my throat is closing, like my body is physically stopping itself from reaching out. No one wants to talk to me either. Even when they know I'm hiding something it feel like they don't care enough to ask. But when they do I feel nothing but judgement and it feels like people are always trying to defend themselves. All I want is a wonderfully warm hug, someone to hold me and make me feel like nothing else matters. A long, meaningful hug. Something to make me feel like the birds are chirping again, the rain is falling slower, or even just a sign that I'm still living, not just alive. But I am dead inside and I wish to be dead all around. I hate my life. I hate myself. "
"I'd rather die in America than be sent back ""home""","Growing up I always felt like an American. I see this country as my home, but legally I've never been an American. And I know in the eyes of many I'm nothing more than a criminal.
I'm aware that I have no future either way, but I would much rather die in my real home, the U.S.  "
I need someone to talk to. I feel like everyone I meet gives me the cold shoulder.,"My friends seem to just move on without me. My contact list is full but nobody wants me to be their friend. Im not even a back up plan. Everyone else always has plans, families, relationships. I try new hobbies and try to met nee people but everyone seems to not care about me as much as i care about them. My story is so sad. What do i do? I know i need help."
I made too many bad choices to recover,"The bad choices I made in life were not obviously bad choices: prioritize school over your social life, major in a STEM field, don't work a part-time job if you don't need the money, not joining a frat, not being a social butterfly, changing my major, etc All of this has added up to me being 26 and living in my parents basement. While my friends are living fun lives, awesome apartments, great jobs and cute girlfriends. Even making some of the right choices like getting a summer internship, being actively involved in an engineering design team, and participating in class hasn't mitigated this. I have over a dozen references who would speak the world of my work ethic, intelligence, and enthusiasm but it doesn't matter because most employers don't bother to check them until they made a decision. At the airbnb house there are a ton of girls having fun all probably around my age working in 55-70k/year easy PR/Event planning jobs. All because they either knew how to sell themselves or knew someone within. My small network doesn't afford me any leads so I am stuck with online applications which yields some dozen interviews but mostly companies who decide to pass me on because I am not 100% perfect candidate with 6 years of experience. Even if I did get job that even just pays above 45k/year, It will still be hard to develop a ton of good friendships like people do in college and high school. Even harder to find a quality girl since most relationships are formed through mutual friends. At one point I had a knife to my chest but was too afraid to go through with it. On the other hand a quick painful death would be better than a slow prolonged torture.  "
It's over.,I've decided I've given up. Thank you Reddit for being my only happiness though what time I had. Thank you. See ya later.
"I've pushed everyone away, and it's all my fault.","I honestly don't know how I got to this point, but on the surface things seem to be going well. I got good marks last semester, and I joined a good number of clubs, and volunteered in things that I enjoyed. Except, school just started up again, and I have no friends in any of my classes. Of my current friends, they're all too busy with their coursework to strike up a conversation. The same could be said of me. Except I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I have to say anymore since I've just burdened them with my venting, beforehand. I honestly started enough fights with my friends online that some have started to stop talking to me. Granted, I apologized excessively, they won't even acknowledge me in the hallway anymore. I honestly think it's my fault for all of this. My depressive mood swings have honestly done enough damage to my friendships.I'm just fed up with life, because I know I'm just going to end up just studying hard, and accepting my circumstance that I'm in. I know that even if I continue to get these good marks, I'm just going to be as miserable as I am moving on. I'm honestly just sad, since it's just me playing games after a night of hard work. I'm just so alone now. Fuck junior year so far, even though it just started. Fuck man, this rant has been too long, and incoherent. And quite frankly I'm sorry for wasting your time if you're still reading."
Ciao,"Wanna know what sucks? Typing with one hand. Even more? Typing with your non-dominant hand only. Even even more? Typing with your one non-dominant hand because you just got your dominant hand cut off mid forearm.I bought a Beretta 92 fs or whatever. Or my friend did for me. I got one of those hollow points with the pink polymer in the middle they only sell to law enforcement except in states like this one. After hurricane Irma hits here (I love that weather), I'm outer than Ricky Martin. Out of here, and out of my damn body.Ever been in a wheelchair because you had to? Takes away your agency and dignity. Doesn't matter. Idk why I'm saying this. Maybe it's the alcohol and painkillers and such. Maybe it's a sense of duty to let some know that they're justified in their choice when they're in dire straits like me. Maybe it's Maybelline. Who the fuck knows.I'm out. I already know how I'll be taken care of after death. My estate goes to my friend since my family disowned me. My body will be cremated, and he will spread my ashes around frisco, the stonewall inn in NY, mount rushmore, the grand Canyon and so on. I left him enough money to do that until he dies of old age.I'm out and done. I love you all. Don't fret over me. I just want you to know that life is not for every circumstance. If there is an afterlife, see you then. I love you all."
Everyone is hurting me,"So my life was pretty fucked up already. Then i fell in love with my best friend. Then she forced me to lose the feelings, replaced me, doesnt trust me and started keeping things from me. I just can't anymore, especially with her because she is all that i care about and all i got. "
Might delete later. I just wanted to say something,"Some weeks ago (it can be months... Time is going on so fucking fast lately its scary) I said that the only reason to keep living was sex. That immediate satisfaction you get, and nothing else is real or really worth it. And when sex doesn't fill you up any more, then it's time to go, because there is nothing left.
I did not think the time would come so fast. I thought it might be years and years of trying to get a normal life until I'm totally drained of sexual desire, and by that time I would have kids and I don't want to kill myself if I have kids. But no, it only took some weeks. Whatever I still do is just me trying to get back to better times, but there is always something missing... It's obvious that what's old doesn't work anymore, but I can't think of anything new. I might have reached the epitome of ""creativity"" at 17/18. Awesome.
And I'm lost. I couldn't be more lost and it's scary. I see everyone finding their place in the world and their passion and where they belong and I have nothing of that. I'm just walking alone and the people that should support me the most make me feel bad for it. And I don't know how much more Ill be able to stand it.
And now I look at the two people I still take three buses and pretend that I don't hate my life for, and I want to hug them and tell them that they will be everything they want to be and more. Because they have something to live for. Because they're good and their smiles are so sincere and heart warming. Because they belong somewhere. Because they don't cry at 6 am writing suicidal things in reddit (I hope they don't really mean it if they do).
So if I decide to really do it... because I feel like there is nothing else to live for, because the pressure is too high here and I can hardly breathe and death would be such a relief... I just want them to know how much they're appreciated and how I thought about them in my last times. Them and a couple of artists I listen to everyday and love. Thanks for coming into my life and I don't care if you fight, you make my days better and you give me a reason to do one of the few things I enjoy that is singing."
Goodbye cruel world.,Life is 99% suffering 1% fake pleasure. I'm doing it today and I'm happy and I can't wait.Why would I seek help when they tell me I need to work to live.I don't want to work ever again.If I have to work to live than it is best to die.
How do I get through my days?,"I am a college student and I feel horrible all the time and often think about suicide. I have already got far behind the study schedule. This is supposed to be my last year, but I don't know if I am going to make it. I have days I cant come out of bed at all, where I can't do more than hang around my room or where I can drag myself to school, but can't get any work done. I try to get through school by working on the days I have slightly more energy, but the bad days keep ruining it. I don't see much point in life anymore. I sometimes get so upset I destroy my books or cut my furniture which I always regret afterwards. I am on a waiting list for a psychologist, but the wait takes forever let alone being helped. I wish how I feel wouldn't obstruct my life and I don't know what to do about it. "
Thinking about suicide. Alot.,"Hello.
Ive never posted on Reddit and rarely ever peruse the site. Im not particularly ugly or attractive. I have had several girlfreiends and im 24. I hangout with alot of friends and my family life is great. The problems im facing seem lesser to others that post here. Im sorry if this is a waste of time but i have nobody real to open up to. Several times in the past week ive been ready to end it all. I really have no articulate reason as to why. I just feel like i dont wanna live anymore. I understand its hard to help someone without any problems, but thats the problem. I feel this way even when my life is going great. I can only imagine what ill feel like when the tide shifts."
"I give up, I'm done","Pushed away the only two people in my life who were just trying to help me.  I'm sick of being an asshole, alone and miserable.  I'm going to go to sleep and not wake up.  Sorry everyone, for being such a failure.  Life will be better for me not being in it.   Edit:  I'm such a failure.  Exhaust plugged, windows up but i couldn't start it.  Just another fuck up in a long string of fuckups."
"I'm scared, confused and I want to die.","I hate myself.
I'm a fat, stupid, worthless, piece of trash disgrace. I know for a fact the people around me would be so much better off without me. I find myself crying in secret everyday and hiding my tears under the blanket at night as I feel empty and lonely surrounded by the darkness.
It feels like I never have and I never will fit in. Every night, I wish that I could end it all, that I could have a disease, or that I could jump in front of a moving vehicle to save someone letting myself be hit just so that I could do one thing worth full in my life. I just want to end it all and what's scary is I just might.My day is a mix of fake happiness around others to swings of rage fits and depressive feelings. I know that everyone I know and love would either be unaffected or better off if I wasn't born. No one knows, no one can know. I feel like there's nobody's there to talk or someone who would care. I have nothing to live for.
I'm sorry..."
I just want to leave,"I�۪m 15 and I just want to leave everything... I�۪m not in school because of depression, so I just sit around all day thinking of all the things I want to do. It really sucks... A few days ago I went out of state for a couple days, and I felt alive again. Now, back home I feel like total shit. I�۪m doing jack shit for school and fucking up my future, and it�۪s just eating me alive. I can�۪t take it anymore, I�۪m just so useless and pathetic. Everyday, I think about suicide, I don�۪t want to die, but I really cant take this anymore. "
Such a POS,I feel like I'm the biggest Piece of Shit right now. Why can't I just do it and get it over with? I'm sitting here with 5 knives (ranging from kitchen to pocket) and all I've managed to do is a few small cuts on my leg. I know my stepdad has a gun and I k ow where he keeps it.... But I don't want my mom to find me with my brains blown out the back of my head. I actually don't want her to find me at all.It seems everything that I do I end up being the asshole. I try to help with something.... I'm the asshole.I ask someone a question..... I'm the asshole.Simple things like.... accidentally forgetting to replace the trash bag becomes a giant fight and ...... You guessed it ...... I'm the asshole.I'm tired of being lonely and tired of feeling like shit. I'm done.
planning,i just moved and im struggling to make connections. im relying too much on my boyfriend - i have no job or friends of my own. my depression has come back worse than ever before. im planning my suicide. i give myself 3 weeks.
I'm a bit lost,What are you supposed to say when you feel this way. I don't know how to start.
My depression is crippling me.,"I'm 26 female and this year my dog died in February she was the only family I had who loved me. I am a uni student long distance uni, I have no friends and the family I have I am no longer in contact with because they are abusive. I don't think that I am getting better, I have ptsd since early childhood. Depression and anxiety are in full force, every day is a struggle as I feel numb to the world. My original plan was to kill myself on the 13th  as it would mark the 7th month without my dog. I'm not coping well with the fact I don't have anything worth living for. I tried to look at some work from home jobs and try to work towards getting some money and I don't see the point. I feel like everything in society is unsustainable the job market being one of them. Also what is happening in Europe frightens me, I try to think positively by seeing myself stronger maybe with children 2 dogs and my So. I just feel full of fear and stress for the future and at this rate I am having psychosomatic illness and I don't want to be seen this way.I have suffered abuse from my family and traumatic events, I just feel so tainted like I can't come back up from this. In reality I don't know if I will do anything but I have thoughts which convince me otherwise. I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I just need someone to hear me. I feel awful each day and there is no hope for me, I feel so alone and I wish that I was nothing so I would not suffer like this every single day.Sorry if I don't make sense or if I am in the wrong place. "
Cant cope,"So me and my ex where dating for about a year, im 23 shes 22 we loved eachother we where the same person in different bodies. Then all of sudden in June it just started going downhill. She lost her best friend and starting bringing it out on me. For example i said shecwas cute a month on the phone while she was drunk and she says ""SO IM ONLY CUTE WHEN IM DRUNK"" we where in a semi long distance relationshiop about 200km. But, i just dont get it it was my birthday wednesday. I bought her dinner on my birthday she was saying how nice and that im the best person ever. Then we end up going to her friends who like 50 and an ex hell angel. Were drinking or whatever and i guess she knew her ex. They kept talking about, then she told me she fucked her son. She kept slamming beers down her throat and i told her to stop and we should take a taxi and go home. Then i go take a piss and theres two guys there telling me to leave. Im like no im not leaving likevwtf is going on im not leaving without her then they said to leave or else well fuck you up. So i left walked about 10km to my girlfriends to grab my stuff. Then she comes back there, she says i should fought for her. Inwas like wtf lets have breakfast and talk about it. So we do resolve what was going through her head. Then shes about to drive me to bus and loses it kicks me out the car. I miss my bus and have to walk 3km to get another. I just dont understand. Shit is just to weird. I honestly have no idea what happened that night. I still dont it eas just so fucken random. Longest relationship ive been in usualy have 1 month flings. Aint much for dating till i met her. I cannot stop thinking about that night and why she hates me all of a sudden. Shits been eating me apart. Ive never felt so emotional. Am i just clouded by past emotions for wanting to be friends with her still. Not relationship just friends. I can barely sleep anymore. It just feels to weird not having her in a minor part of my life of being friends. Shes like the only person ive talked to for the past year. That shit that hurts is i still dont know why that happened, it was so fucken random. She says im self centered i bought her food and did what she wanted on my birthday. We where supposed to die in bed and watch movies. I hate drinking and i knew somethkng fucked was gonna happen if we drank, because shes very emotional sober, drunk she has no idea whats going on. I just cant cope. Dors this shit pass. Am i making a mistake by trying to still be friends. Sorry for wall of text, im so lost. I was so close to shooting myself last night drinking my nerves and emotions away. I feel fucken possesed by thoughts. None of this makes sense to me. I was wanting to die last year i had no family, friends.  then i met her and she made me happy again. Now i just feel fucked and want it all to end. Got nothing and nobody in my life"
Growing pains,Really close to losing it _���
I wish I could,"I'm alone. There is no meaning. I try to be good or even just ok and I fail at it. The reason why I don't kill myself right now is because I'm not sure that I would succeed. Hopefully I'll be able to do it in the next couple of days. Does anyone know how much xanax and rum it would take to kill a 6'2 165 pound man, and if that's a bad way to die? I'll be honest, I don't really want to experience pain or leave anything too disgusting for my family, so if any insight on that was given too, I'd really appreciate it."
I will live my last days,"I have fear to leave this world but is the only option I have. I can't bear anymore, the sadness, the pain and the emptiness are much for me. I have to die, I don't want to be here anymore, I'll just finish my last period in my college, finish some animes and videogames, then I have to say goodbye to this world, I love life and is so much painfully for me be alone all the time and I know it's my fault but well I just don't have strength anymore. I don't want to see anymore how people is happy and I am a outcast. I have nothing and i don't know but die is the only peace for me now. Sorry for my bad english. "
Has anyone here ever had experience in a group home?,"My best friend is in the hospital after another suicide attempt. They're medicating her (poorly) but want to send her to a group home because she's not getting better (she's only been there for a week but whatever.) I'm scared, scared that she'll be worse off, scared that she'll get more depressed, and scared that she'll be stuck in there forever."
Last Chance,This will be the last chance I give to life. In 2 weeks a friend will visit me and I am so afraid that she won't be able to like me anymore once she saw me in person.. I can't live without friends. I need to know that there is someone who cares about me..
My suicidality is genuinely the most positive part of my life,"I am not depressed. I am currently healthy both physically and mentally and yet my constant thoughts of self harm and suicide are just as strong as they have been for the entirety of my waking life. And I am super happy about them!I've made a few posts on here about how I was confused and irritated by them in the past but after having some time to rest and recuperate, I feel completely sold by my thoughts to end my life. I feel like my body should logically be destroyed and it's now pretty much objectively the right idea for me. Whether that is by my own hand or in a situation where someone else kills me. If someone pulled a gun to me and shot right now, I would feel pretty content about my painful end to my life (and it saves me the effort of doing it myself!)Life is really fun and I enjoy the company of my friends as well. Work is satisfying too. But none of it is such that I need to carry on living to see or do any more of it. I just feel satisfied in what I have to do to myself.I guess the only reason I'm staying around is that it is currently a right faff for me to die right now. I got a couple if boring things to get organised and then I'll be free to do whatever.I know it feels weird me posting this reasonably inspiring story on here, but I guess it's just that I want to vocalise it around people who wouldn't be immediately weirded out or just mindlessly telling me to call a suicide hotline. Also I feel it's nice to let the community that allowed me to be comfortable and happy with my suicidality know about where I got in the end.Thanks for the help "
Life will never satisfy me.,"I've suffered too much, goodbye."
I'm back again...,My girlfriend left me today. My minds on suicide again. I need help... again. I'd rather not bother anyone anymore so if someone isn't busy I think I'd like to attempt to talk about it. I'm contemplating just taking some pills to sleep soon so sorry if there's no response...ever. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time
Please.,"Darkness starts to seep in as my walls break, the walls that have kept me sane these past few years. Truth is i'm so damn tired. I'm drowning in insecurities, anger, envy, sadness. What once made me happy does no justice for me anymore. What once were my goals seem unreachable now.I want to live. I do. But that thought wavers when everyday i'm finding it harder to see a reason for me to keep living. I feel that i'm just a nuisance to everyone. "
"I won't kill myself, but I need reasons to live","Hey. So I think about killing myself a lot. I won't kill myself, since I know what kind of pain that would inflict on those around me. I also don't think it's worth it to distance myself from those people before killing myself as it'd cost a lot of time and effort, and when they'd find out they'd still be hurt.But I feel zero motivation to live. The only things I do in life are to serve others, to ease their time in the world. I have a job that keeps me occupied a few days a week. Sometimes I hang with friends. I'll read, watch stuff, and play games occasionally, but this is me trying to pass the time, it feels like chores. Same thing with sports, or even eating. I don't feel motivated to care much for myself, although I do eat healthy as I don't want to be too much of a burden on this planet either.I feel like I'm a burden a lot. I let a lot of friendships go without attention, but those friends don't seem to mind that either. When I do spend time and energy it's somewhat appreciated but there doesn't seem to be a lot of will to reciprocate.Maybe I'm annoying to them or otherwise rather avoided by people. Maybe I don't show how shitty I feel about life in general. I don't know.I've come here to ask what you think there is to live for. I think we as humans cause so much harm to everything and everyone around us, inadvertently or not, that it's better to not exist."
i focused on my career and failed at that as well,"yup, nothing left but ashes and dust. give me pity, im addicted "
just cant cope,"I literally wake up, put on a happy face with friends but when i'm buy  myself i cant fucking cope i just cant carry on feeling so bad every waking moment breaking down all the time not knowing how to get a single bit of joy out of life. abused by my father for 9 years and losing my only rock in life my mom. wtf am i going to do with myself im fucking dying on the inside. everyone has it so good and i can barely function as a human what is the fucking point anymore, but maybe im just pathetic and being a baby i dont know anymore"
"Whenever I feel like everything seems to be going well, something stupid happens and brings me back to reality","Everything seemed to get apart, I started working out, cured my acne, getting good grades, feeling a bit more happy over the past month. But now after spending some time with my ""friends"" I just realized how much no one cares about me, even my own sister who I thought was the only person who really loved me; turns out she doesn't give a shit about me either. I personally don't care if I live or not I just don't want to hurt anyone if I kill myself, and for some reason I still feel like I would hurt some people which I really don't want to. That's really the only thing that keeps me away from doing it."
I want to disappear,I haven't felt like this for a few months. I forgot I could even feel like this but now I'm in bed crying my eyes out unsure of what to do. Right now the only person who's keeping me grounded is my dad. But if I ever lose him I don't know what will happen to me. I'm so depressed right now I don't want this I just want to go to sleep please help me
"Ive stopped myself from ending it tonight, the rope still sits around my neck and my note is written out","I'm just feeling like shit, that's all I can say. I've got loads of things that I can mention and I can write all things that's wrong with my life and  feel sorry about myself for a bit but in all honesty I just feel crap. I've felt like crap for years but I finally want to give up, im tired of being tired all the time. I'm sick of being angry and depressed with life I just want it to end but yet again i stopped myself because the overwhelming feeling of guilt. What I'd do to the people I left behind, but it's getting to the point where I want to be selfish, I want to just think about myself for once and finally be at peace."
I can feel myself slipping away again,"I tried killing myself almost half a decade ago, but it didn't work out the way I wanted it too. Honestly, I'm thankful for all the extra time that I've had. There were lots of good memories that I wouldn't have gotten to have if I had died that night, and great people that I'd have never known.But I still feel the same way I did before, it's been sitting in the back of my mind all this time, sometimes barely noticeable and other times almost consuming my thoughts; but always there. And now I'm finding myself winding down the same fucking path as last time, pushing people away, spending all my time alone, slowly losing all motivation to carry on living an okay life; and there's no reason for it. Nothing set it off. There's been no noticeable change in my life up until I started slipping away, and it's going to ruin me.I've never wanted to kill myself, I'm scared by the idea of it, but I have wanted to die for as long as I can remember, and I know that I can go through with it, with a lot more success than last time. But I've been holding on, and I'm going to keep holding on as long as I can, because part of me hopes that if I just wait, my mood will come around again and balance itself out, like it usually does. I feel like I'm rambling but I don't have many people in my life I can be open to about this sort of thing, and typing all of this out has been a little therapeutic. Thank you for reading this."
Why shouldn't i just do it?,"I can't find any reason not to kill myself except that it would be selfish and might hurt people around me, But that doesn't make sense, Why should i care for people around me and stick around living in my own shell of fears and pain and not listen that whisper in the back of my mind telling me everyday to just slit my wrist.
Why? Why shouldn't i just listen to that voice, why do i have to care about what other people would feel when i decide to end my life?"
A all around failure,First my mom a amputee from the knee Down.my dads a sheet metal worker at 56 years old. I'm 21 never had a job and dropped out of school in the 8th grade.i have dyslexia.i got 2 brothers both better then me they have a family a car a house.all I do is drag everyone down with me.i cost more money then there kids do. Should I do it to help them?
I Choose Suicide-Again! Here's Why.,"I guess this counts as a suicide note.I'm not depressed, or ill, or disabled; I have a job, friends, a home.
I want to die.I was a kid who never did fit anywhere; single parent poverty, bad estate and high functioning autism made sure kids, especially girls, didn't like me. Primary education I hated. So boring.As a teenager school was easy and being top of English made life simple. But people liked me for what I did, not who I was. Scars ran deep.I turned down my First Love as my home life was a joke( my Mother married a chronic alcoholic). Maybe my biggest regret. Hurt for years.I never realised my potential. Barely attended college. Got a position in a major Government Dept at 19 and was the youngest in its history to hold it.
 But I was immature; missed home, felt alienated in the city so resigned.Dating was a joke- Thank God for hookers.
 Girls showed no interest- I could stand in clubs for hours and never be approached. Telephone dating was more miss than hit with few second dates.
 Got in a five year relationship- went to Part Time courses with her and was talked into going to University as I did so well.She cheated on me-3 Times-I ended it. Never scored once at University. Never lived up to my potential though I graduated.
 Felt ugly and second rate so drank too much. But sobered up after graduation.
 Had to work also to support my family(Mother/Brother). Little time or money for extra activities. Joined Police- never truly liked it much though I was good. Quite a few disliked me despite my impressive stats.
 Made the classic error of getting involved with a colleague I fell in love with.Who used me to get her Ex back. Then avoided me.
 I'd left my girlfriend so as to be 'fair'. Then that same colleague got caught doing something and blamed me. I resigned in disgust just shy of my 5 year anniversary.Moved back home and rebuilt my life- even started a social club. Made friends but couldn't date as a result of the above. Just had fun.
 Got a council job I really enjoyed for years - then I rejected a woman who then set out to get me fired, along with her friends.
 My mother had a stroke and took 9 months to die. I had a breakdown and the situation at work worsened, leading to a manager nearly punching me and two camps aligned with me or her. Things worsened.
 I had to leave.Started again. Within a year got a good Government job. Good colleagues, easy work, great conditions.
 A much younger girl, stunningly pretty, made it clear she liked me from the start.
 I made my next big mistake.I ignored her. After everything it seemed wise.But my attraction grew as hers waned - now we're pretty alienated.People there call me intelligent and wise.
 I feel neither. I feel like a fraud.
Everyone likes me bar the one I really want to. Typical.
 I know that was my last, best chance at 46. Blew it.
 I'll always be second rate and second best.Last year I decided to end it with N. Joined EXIT and imported from their Chinese supplier.
Took 15g with anti-emetics, Oramorph and alcohol. Survived and went through Hell in ICU.
 Brother and friends rallied round, as did work. They thought it was a stroke.
 I recovered amazingly quickly- no lasting damage.
I lost two stone and hit the gym to recuperate. Best shape now in years.
 Women notice me- now when it no longer matters. Ironic.
 I wished I had succeeded - tired of hearing about this unwanted 'miracle'.I gathered legal drugs to end it all- planned my final weekend.
 That Friday my house caught fire and destroyed most of my stash. Living room destroyed.
 For 3 weeks I was a refugee in my own Life.
 Now I have a flat while my house is repaired.I'll end it all here.I've seen psychiatrists, nurses, crisis team, sessions with a counsellor, 2 doctors and a Locum and even a Police intervention.
 I'd to my best friend my intention(couldn't be his Best Man now) and he spread it.
 My Brother has disowned me as weak. He thinks I'm being looked after by something/one.All agree I'm not mentally ill or even depressed- put it down to 'Cognitive Disorder'.
 I just remember being so peaceful and happy the first time, ready to die. Slept happily after dosing.
 Then again in ER when I felt myself slip away into blackness.I feel this Life is empty- no viable option attracts me. It feels vaguely revolting to be here.
 I am always somehow able to fail despite my aptitude. No-Win situations are rife.
 This girl at work exemplifies this- what I want I can never have. Like she's  there just to remind me I don't belong here.
 My living this long is a mistake.I just wish to cease to exist- to leave on my own terms and time of my choosing.It's about control- the only true control I have that matters.Maybe only I think like this.But I hope others know these thoughts they may have aren't bad or wrong- they may be right in the circumstance.I'm Finished."

How to help a severely depressed/suicidal friend?,"My best friend tried to kill himself 3 months ago. He struggles with depression, but, once medicated, can be fine for years on end. He takes breaks from his medication occasionally to prove to himself he doesn't need it to function. It's worked a few times where he's unmedicated for a few years with no problems. This last bout of depression without medication ended with him taking a cocktail of pills. We found him in time, and took him to the ER. The only way for him to be released on his own recognizance, as opposed to being committed to a state run facility, was to go back on medication and follow a strict outpatient program with counseling/therapy.He was doing SO great for a few months! I was super happy! He spoke positively about therapy and really seemed to have a new outlook on life. He's got an incredibly supportive network of friends and family. Lately, he seems to have fallen back into the behavior patterns leading up to the suicide attempt. Isolation, canceling clients at work (self employed small business owner), staying up all night doing cocaine, etc.
I just can't understand why, with all the positive changes he made after his attempt, this is happening again. He's always managed fine on medication previously which makes me wonder if he's even taking it regularly. Long story short, he's pushing me away, and I'm so so worried that another attempt is imminent. I don't know how to handle it or what to say or do. I give him his space and offer to listen if and when he feels like talking. I just feel like it's not enough and I'm scared to death of losing my best friend. Thanks for any advice. "
life FUCKING SUCKS,"fuck life. if there weren't a few things in it that made me happy i would've offed myself a long-ass time ago. but im literally G.A.R.B.A.G.E. to employers. fucking useless. i provide no usefulness to society. employers would rather hire a literal piece of shit than me. what the FUCK is the point of applying to jobs if you don't even get a goddamn response? why even fucking bother when i have literally N.O.T.H.I.N.G. to offer??? looks like my previous work experience doesn't mean shit and my degree might as well be toilet paper because i majored in something fucking useless. and to add on to all of that, i'm too depressed to even try learning new skills or apply to jobs. AIN'T THAT JUST FUCKING GRAND??? i just wanna fucking die"
Maybe I should be dead,"I am 19 years old. My parents died for cancer in the space of last two years. I have no family, nothing. And I was abused the whole life by my mother. I am also here by accident so I guess everything is trying to say to me that i was not meant to be born. Now I understand, goodbye."
I'm not depressed I'm angry,"My suicidal thoughts have evolved from being depressed to just being anger towards life. It's not the same as when your sad . This is much darker. I could never harm a soul. But I don't know how to continue to go on. I turn 21 on 9/14 . Life is just starting but is it honestly worthit? I can't control my feelings anymore I just want people to support me/my actions I feel like I have nothing to live for.
 I recently been able to distract myself with a couple of hobbies but the thoughts are still there. I need people to talk to. Anyone "
It's my fault,"I've made it through a lot and I'm really fucking done. At 17 I've been raped, molested by a close family member, survived 2 previous suicide attempts, and destroyed my college chances with drugs and alcohol. I have no one to talk to right now. My ex girlfriend of over two years left me because I was too depressing and since then I've faced nothing but rejection. Someone give me something to live for because I'm drawing a blank. I just want to start over. "
I posted this in r/depression too but I'm feeling really shitty. Yesterday was my birthday... I don't know why I bother anymore.,"So I made plans to have a party today. I invited people a month ago, reminded them a week ago. A few people said they were down so I bought a 60$ bonfire permit for today. A lot of money for me right now since I'm broke but I wanted to have a happy birthday for once. Well my birthday rolls by and I don't hear from anyone, and had another loneliest day of the year. Today I reached out to the people that said they're coming and either got no reply or they couldn't come. From literally everyone.This is the second birthday in a row that something like this has happened and I spent it all alone. Maybe 3, I can't remember. Not to mention every other holiday where people are out having fun(Halloween, ect.). I haven't actually hung out with any of my ""friends"" since before I graduated college a year and a half ago.I've been doing all the things that are supposed to make you feel better, like going to the gym, trying to get into university for something not worthless like my college degree, quitting my toxic job, deactivating facebook but none of it is fucking working. I just want a fucking friend."
"Yesterday I tried to kill my self by drowning myself , help!",Why would you do that bro
I took 60 150 mg lyrica about 30 mins ago and I haven't felt anything?? Did I do something wrong?,You there?
I really need help or just someone to talk to and I just dont know,"Um I really just dont know how to write like an intro for this shit, but like I guess I am just going to dive right into it. I am at college and I hate it. The school that I wanted to go to is in my hometown, where all of my friends went. I am like 5 hours away and I know nobody at this school. My friends are all having the time of their life while I am stuck at this shitty school full of rednecks and racists who only give a shit about drinking and partying. While I actually love that shit, I am not about it here. Just not my fucking thing, especially with these people. I worked at a job over the summer that required me to live elsewhere, so I didnt see my family very much at all since after graduation. I miss my fucking family and friends so much and I just want to see them but they wont come down to visit me. Not only that, a girl that I really like (and the only girl I actually have feelings for when I'm 100% sober) just kind of told me that she isnt interested. This is a theme with any girl that I like. I just dont know what to do and I dont know how to type it out but yeah theres a reason why I am here I just need some sort of like confirmation of my existance or I dont know just help. "
I'm feeling worse and worse daily.,"I'm easily hated and I deserve it. I'm an annoying piece of shit and I can't even change as everything I'm hated for I can't change. My few friends are even starting to hate me.Every day I get more and more lonely and I'm to much of a pussy to tell anyone IRL. I also feel anxiety every time I talk to people now as the constant worry of them hating me are echoing through my head and I try to repress it but it's just making it worse. Music is somewhat therapeutic for me though but even that can make me feel worse thinking how far they've come whilst I'm still some nobody.Every day I see a new headline saying ""(Insert name here) has died in (murder, car accident, suicide etc) and I feel jealous knowing that they at least have some peace. Loneliness is one of the worse feelings to experience as the further you fall down, the harder it is to recover. It feels like a song on repeat but it get's worse by every replay.I have some online friends I guess but I'm still to nervous to tell them even how much worse I've gotten these couple days.No one will notice that I'm depressed as I'm still faking being the happy, outgoing and semi-self deprecating self."
Suicidal Ideation,This is not what I thought my life would be. I had a full on suicidal breakdown two days ago and instead of killing myself I called a friend for help. It was the worst decision ever and I honestly still want to die. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.
What am I to do? Suicidal ideation...,"I am losing the will to live. I am a widow at 23. Just had to spend my 1 yr anniversary alone. I married the perfect man and I ruined my whole life in one day. In one week I lost my husband, career, physical health, mental health, many friends, and all self confidence. All of this started with a car wreck. I haven't been working for months, my job is sore at me. My friends who were there for me have abandoned me due to my own isolation or lack of motivation to help me. My career means nothing to me and I don't even want to be in the same field. I have a masters and I don't want it anymore. I used to be happy and now I can barely be bothered to get up and take a shower in a day or maintain a healthy diet. I hate myself. I just want to die. I feel like I should have died from the wreck too. My life is a never ending shit fest where I get guilt tripped into living. Fuck these people who get to be bystanders at the glorious trainwreck that is my life. Oh, icing on the cake, I am facing felony manslaughter charges for my husbands death as well. I hate my life. I just want to hurt myself but I am an unmotivated coward. The only thing that keeps me going is the distractions I find like online shopping and cleaning and getting rid of anything that reminds me of my previously happy life that was actually going places. Do your worst Reddit."
I'm stuck in this place...,"I'm a ghost, I'm invisible to most  of the people at my school, only a few acknowledge my presence, and even fewer people talk to me. I feel forgotten. Everyone is out having fun with each other and here I am, on my couch typing this while listening to music. I wish everyone at my school wasn't fake, acting like people don't exist until they can't take it and kill themselves or die unexpectedly. I've seen it all. I've seen it with two people, and only one is still brought up. It's because he was in a club at my school. The other is probably forgotten by everyone else.
I'm probably going to leave tonight. If I do I want those at my school (you'll know who you are) to not be begging for attention because '' (the two guys I normally hang out with are the only ones allowed to say that) or '.' I just want everyone else to not feel like what I have. I've always been alienated by most of you. Those who knew me know I've been bullied. Just know I remembered you all to the very end. I guess I could have buried the hatchet and let some things go, but I didn't.
I don't want my funeral to be in a church. I want to have it somewhere outside (big enough to have at least twenty or thirty people but have enough room for more if necessary). I don't want anyone just sitting and  having a pity party for me. I want you all to talk about their favorite stories of me.
I'm probably going to be online for another hour or so to make up my mind one last time. Feel free to talk to me. If I decide not to (tonight at least) I will update the post.
Edit: I know I said an hour or so but I think I'm going to sleep on it tonight and see how I feel when the morning comes."
I'm doing it tomorrow,I have nothing to lose from a suicide attempt even if I become paralysed.I live a boring live inside a house for the last 3 years and I hate most people.I have really nothing to lose except my chains.To be honest becoming paralysed is better than working everyday from 9-5 I don't care about my family.I look them in eyes and tell them I will start working tomorrow but I will commit suicide.
"Inch, by inch....","Have started to put it all together, practicing some, going through the steps, making sure all goes well, no surprises etc.... except the last step obviously since I am writing this. Surprised with the lack of emotions or drama. I thought I would be scared or nervous or crying or sad,  but I am not, not at all.  When the time comes I really believe it is going to be as easy has feeding yourself, scratching an itch, or putting on a shirt. Something you just do without thinking, you just do it without a thought. I am genuinely surprised with this revelation. Almost let down, lol. I am not delusional. I know exactly what is happening and that I am marching towards something that is going to bring a huge amount of pain to people around me. Something where there is always a possibility of solving some time in the future. That little light of hope is no longer good enough. I don't care about possibilities anymore, I want something more absolute. I want something more concrete. I am tired of putting forth effort and not getting anything for it and the thought of well, keep trying, one day it will be OK, is no longer good enough. I have pretty much done it all to try and fix myself, and have had zero positive results. Not even close to being OK. It is a huge disappointment. I am so tired of trying that I no longer want to put forth any effort. Especially more effort into things I have done over and over and over.... for years. I do wish there was something no psychologist has ever told me, something ground breaking, a light bulb moment that changes my life forever etc.... but they are all the same and say the same shit. I have zero drive left. All used up. Either a miracle happens in the next 4 months or lights out. I thought my family would be enough to keep me holding on, and it was for a lot of years, but it isn't anymore. Sure, I love them and they love me, but love of others is not enough when you have nothing in your life to give you meaning and the feeling of accomplishment.  I am literally just taking up space now. "
lmao were all done here,no one??m I was hoping but id's okkdoing wellthank you
My niece told me that she was disgusted with me because I am living with my parents due to chronic pain disabilities.,"And I can't help but feel that she is right. And I should just finally end it. Background. The people that I live with and call my parents are not my bio parents. I used to date their son for 7 years and they took me in as a daughter even after he and I broke up.   In 2008 i got really ill due to depression when I was working at T-Mobile. Got my gall bladder removed, etc before we found out why. Eventually I ran out of FMLA and was fired from my job along with my boyfriend because my illness made him have migraines so he couldn't work either.    We moved back in with his folks and I decided to go to college. I lived here while I was going to the local college and I moved out when I transferred to the University. I was going for a Biology degree and didn't realize I was un-diagnosed ADD.   Needless to say Uni was kicking my ass and in my final year I got suicidal one summer. I moved back in with the family around the end of 2014. During this entire time I suffered from chronic migraines. After I graduated I got a job at a local cannery as a quality analyst and worked there for about 4 months till I was let go because of missing too much work due to the migraines. Then the following winter I developed fibromyalgia which manifested as my limbs being on fire. I am a good worker, I am willing to work, but my body is failing me.   Add to this I have Borderline personality disorder, ADD, PTSD from being abused and molested as a child, anxiety disorder, and chronic depression. Those weren't diagnosed till my last college term at Uni. So I got shit done even though I had all this un-diagnosed shit.     So I've been here about three years now and in this time two teenage girls have moved in that are my ex boyfriends, ex girlfriends (after me) daughters who were found and awarded custody to her because their father was abusing them. Well their mom also had mental health issues and she wasn't able to handle raising them so mom took them in as well.   The youngest, who is 17, was angry at me over shared bathroom space and told me that I needed to grow up and get a job and move out. She said I was disgusting, and I am just using mom and dad, I am not living a life, I need to get out and stop being a user. This coming from a teenager who mom and dad have spend probably in the triple digits on by now for her and her sister to move here from out of state because her mom sure couldn't afford the flights and drive to make CPS meetings. Who gets tattoos bought and her girlfriend gets stuff bought for her with mom and dads money. And I already feel bad enough that I don't ask them for anything and wear the same outfit everyday just about and clothes that have holes in them because I feel I have already cost them too much. Yea I don't go anywhere because of anxiety and because I don't want to ask them for gas money. Even though they inherited a ton of money recently I still live like they are just living on their retirement savings. By my choice.         I'm disabled, and it is only this past week that I have some to terms with that. Since I lost my last job I have been to many doctors trying to find out what was wrong with me and a way to control the pain enough so that I can work. I went to a pain clinic and took a 10 week class twice to try to change my perspective about my pain.    I have to file for disability now, but it took me a long while to accept it because my biological mother and brother basically used that money to live. I wanted to be different, I wanted to make something of myself.    But now I feel like I did all this stuff to only wind up like them. And people can't see my disability so they will think less of me. They will think I am too lazy and just living off the government even though I paid my taxes into SSI for 20 years.   But I finally accepted it, and I was going to file, and was going to find an attorney to file. But what she said today brings my worthlessness crashing back. Even if I file today it could be years before it gets accepted. And I am not living a life worth living. I'm just a burden, and on disability I will continue to be a burden, this time to society. Whats the point if college was my peak? I'm single, no kids. I have pets but I already know people that would take them in and love them. There really isn't anything to look forward to besides seeing how Game of Thrones ends. And I already know everyone is going to die.   I have the method, and I know it will be a painful one. But I feel its what I deserve. And a heart attack isn't as grisly (to those that would find me) as other methods. "
I am so lost.,"Throwaway because my husband uses Reddit. Also, possible long post. Things have been insane the last couple of years. Let's start with getting married. When my husband and I first got married I asked him to delete all naked photos of women (like stand alone naked photos) because I felt uncomfortable with it. I didnt mind if he watched porn or jerked off. Just dont save photos, kinda like I would ask him not to go to a strip club. I think its inappropriate while married and I would hope he would respect me enough to not go. Well, in 2015 things started going downhill. He almost lost his job and that created a huge amount of stress for him, he ended up becoming someone who abused alcohol. And while that sucked enough, he would pick fights with me, or call me awful names. Around that time he started saving naked photos of women again, I got to hear things like ""everyone's hotter than you"" ""she's a fantasy of what I wish you looked like"" etc. As you can imagine that really didnt help my insecurities at all. And he's better now, got help in rehab, anti depressants. Myself, I always knew there was something wrong with me, and I can't afford seeing a doctor so I just follow support groups and try and do DBT alone, but I mostly relate to people with BPD. And I've always had the symptoms of it, but after everything with my husband I feel kind of out of control now. For the most part I've been working on myself. Trying to at least, but unfortunately he still saves photos of naked women. Again, fine with porn, fine with jerking off. We have an active sex life (the only reason its been dry for 3 weeks is due to switching BC), I don't see how this is such a hard thing for him to break. I don't see how he doesn't see what it does to me. I've never felt so insecure in my life. Its gotten to the point where I can't even enjoy porn due to my mind thinking about how my husband probably wishes I looked like that. I can't look at women without thinking about how he wishes he could fuck her. And I have a bad taste in my mouth about men. I am so emotionally exhausted and destroyed. it sounds silly but I can't get through the day without wanting to kill myself. I dont feel good enough for him or anyone really. I'm too the point where I can't stand living. I've started self harming again as well. I feel like things will never get better. Yes, I've talked to him about it. It usually just ends up in fights and him telling me to stop controlling him and it has nothing to do with me. "
Nothing will ever be ok.,"It might. I can't promise you that it will, but I can say it can happen. I know that sometimes it seems like the dark lasts forever and that light at the end of the tunnel is going to be the train that runs us over but sometimes it really is the sunlight and we can go into it. Please, don't do anything harmful. Find someone to talk to, something to distract you, don't hurt yourself. Okay? "
I've given up recently,"I've given up recently because im trying so hard to be happy trying everything possible while trying to keep friends happy and stable on school, relationships, and just being friends with them but also on how i cant keep being myself anymore and that hurricane Irma is coming for me im thinking of just going outside during it and hoping i die quick, i dont own a gun, forgot to buy rope and dont really wanna go through a slow death in which i could get saved. Idk what to do anymore."
I've been punishing myself again,"I haven't done this since I was 15 I'm 19 now.

"I am happy, but I want to die","My life is good and I enjoy it, but I would rather be dead. I am 16, I don't have a job, and I love school. My life isn't bad or hard. Why do I want to die? I have not eaten or drank anything for 40 hours in hopes for an easy relatively painless death. I wish I would die faster. What should I do?"
Suicidal thoughts after 2-3 years.,"I've always hated my life when I was a kid. The worst part was when my parents got divorced. I remember it so clearly. We were at my grandmothers house and they were arguing and my dad locked up my mom in the car so they could talk. But my mom was screaming. Apparently my dad was threatening to take me and my brother in the car and kill the three of us in a carcrash. That's my mothers story so I don't really believe it. My dad would never do such thing, he is a friendly and would harm no one. But whole my life I thought of him as a loser. He accomplished nothing in his life. He cut bonds with his father (I barely knew my grandparents). He got divorced and I only see him once a year now. My mother pisses me off too. Whenever I tell her a secret she tells all her friends or our family. Especially when it's something personal. I had to go to a psychiatrist because I was feeling depressed and I asked her to keep it a secret but she told EVERYONE. This definitely made me lose trust in her. I don't feel like me and her have anything in common. I can't hold a conversation with her because she is pretty dumb and it drives me insane. So I hate both my parents but I love them at the same time. What always bothered me is that they don't even talk to each other anymore. They are too childish to see each other in real life when one of them picks me up at the other parents place. They have been divorced for fucking 15 years... I used to be a very happy kid but I became kind of introverted. I had a lot of dreams and goals in my life but growing up I spent a lot of time playing videogames. I stopped playing baseball and started working out but stopped with that too. I only play videogames now or drink with friends. I worked a few jobs during summer but I quit all of them for my own reasons. My grades were pretty bad in highschool but I still managed to pass. Now I messed up two years in University (I'm 20 years old) and my mom is furious. I understand. She pays for my education and I screw up. But the thing is.. I have no goals in life. I feel depressed and it's hard to stay motivated when I feel this way. When I was 16 I was thinking about suicide everyday but eventually snapped out of it. But now that I failed University, my life has been going downhill and I don't know what to do. I don't want to work some dead ass boring job but at the same time I don't know what I would love to do. My family is ashamed of me. I can see it in my mother her eyes and my mother her boyfriend has 4 daughters. All of them have amazing grades and high studies. My mom always compares me with them and it makes me feel insecure. I know they will accomplish more in life but I don't care at all. I have no fucking emotions and it's killing me. I only feel anger and sadness  towards everything. I don't know what to do with my life... I'm slowly turning into a version of my dad who accomplished nothing and cut bonds with his father. Someone talk to me please."
Blackmail pushes to suicide,"Hello guys, 18yo,  I'm new here and I'm psychologically exhausted. I'm really thinking about suicide. I me few months ago a girl on a website, from a foreign country. We started to talk a lot and this until today, nearly a year. She told me she was major, in university, nothing special. Then, after many talks we started to have feelings and started a long distance relationship. She was shy and never sent many pics, but she totally looked like a young adult. Our relation became very serious, with family involved, projets about future and live together. Of course, we went to talk about sex and had sexual convos. Then, I knew that she is diagnosed bdp, sociopath, paranoid (i knew it before her lies) She lied to me about everything : age, past, experiences, studies, all. She is in fact really younger than me. Her parents thought she told me, but no, she lied to them too. This gap never bothered them, me I didn't know. When knew, I got shocked and hurted. (Her previous bf was 25, never bothered them)Problem is : her family and her father are ultra religious conservative. Since i was the first guy she talked sexually, they push me to marry her in few years. Despite the fact they know she lied to me. More, they threaten and blackmail me : If i betray her or leave her, they threaten me to go to court and law. Her brother threaten me of death. And since she is completely paranoid, she thinks I betrayed and told to her father that wanna destroy me like told before. Despite all my efforts to explain I never betrayed.I'm exhausted, I did many things for that girl, but she lied to me about all. I'm exhausted, I can't run away except suicide. I know too that her father and brother beats her with a belt.I don't know what to do, I'm exhausted and wanna die"
What keeps you in the game?,"So. I don't want to live but I don't want to end my existence forever.
I've cut myself until I almost died from blood loss, but I didn't.
I've been put in hospitals and injected with drugs that hurt, but nothing changed.
People tell me to be grateful for things, and that just makes me feel guilty.
I've seen psychs here in the south and they are just as insane as me.
Reiki enery healing. The power of Christ, ect.
I've tried to tell myself to be brave. I've tried to be a different person. Tried to accept the robot I became.
Nothing works.
I have two cats. They are the only things keeping me alive.
Crazy cat lady...but when you have nothing and no one to live for...its easy to die.
My cats keep me alive.
No one else will take care of them.
You?"
How do I feel better enough to do something?,"Since April I've been spiraling downward. I have to finish some classes by November, but I'm paralyzed by depression. I don't have insurance, so I can't afford therapy or medication. My days are completely empty. I spend most of my time in bed. I take sleeping pills throughout the day to sleep away my time. I just can't get motivated or interested in what I have to do. I feel like it's a lost cause at this point, that I'll never get my work done. I have no friends. I don't want to live. "
Got it planned out.,"21yo Male. Im married with 2 kids (3 years and 7 months). Im totally dead internally, but Im not a piece of shit, so Im going to blow my brains out when theyre both old enough to live on their own. I feel really guilty because Im going to waste so much of my wifes life for nothing. I know theyll be taken care of, because Im in the military, and if I kill myself while Im still in, my wife will get a fuck ton of money. Im already a developing alcoholic, so maybe thatll get me first."
Is anyone awake?,I just wanna talk
More of a confession than a cry for help,"I am/was (decide for yourself I guess) a sadistic psychopath. I felt no emotion for anyone, it was all emulated. I was a flawless liar and no one ever suspected I was anyone other than who I presented as. I hated most people and it made me happy to see them suffer. I've never physically harmed anyone, but I have ruined people's lives for no reason other than malice. I'm also a longtime user of this sub and frequently preyed upon those seeking help on here via PM. I suspect some of them killed themselves because of me. It wasn't my specific intention but it gave me an unrivaled feeling of satisfaction.I was also a very reckless and self-destructive person without fear. I would do anything just for the experience without worrying about the consequences. The law of averages caught up to me and I made the mistake that I think is going to end me. I decided to transition into a woman for (at the time) fetishistic reasons using hormones. I lied my way through potential gatekeeping, told them I had dysphoria my whole life and all that, it was easy. A few weeks after starting hormones things got weird and only got weirder the longer it went on. Firstly, I was always planning to kill myself while quite young because I felt like my existence was wrong, it was a very vague feeling but it was intense and I had no fear of death so I just decided I would kill myself whenever life stopped being fun. Very quickly that feeling went away. The next change was I started developing emotionally, a full range of emotions I had never experienced. I always thought I was very good at managing my emotions but I think I just never had any emotions to manage. This was/is quite overwhelming. The change that seems like it's going to be my downfall is my developing emotional empathy. I started to care about people and their struggles, even random strangers. It felt so good I would go to bad neighborhoods and give money to homeless people, sit with them and listen to them talk about their lives. It made me happy to make them happy, and thinking about their pain hurt me. I feel like I'm finally turning into a complete person, I didn't understand how empty I was because I never had anything to compare it to.Along with this emotional empathy, though, was something else that I think won't stop escalating until I either kill myself or have a psychotic break. I started to feel guilty about the kind of person I was before and what I did, and it keeps getting worse and it's already unbearable. On top of this I've started getting flashbacks of childhood trauma, and my sanity is slipping rapidly. I want to kill myself again for these new reasons but hilariously there are people in my life I now care about who would be crushed if I did. If anything can be described as poetic justice it's this I imagine. I could de-transition but I never want to go back to how I was, physically or mentally. I don't expect sympathy or even belief from anyone, but I wanted to type this out anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I never want to hurt anyone ever again, I wish I had never hurt anyone, I wish I could take it all back but I can't and nothing I can do will ever make up for it and I'm sorry. This guilt is destroying me and I can't express how sorry I am. "
My mom and my dog are the only reasons I'm still here.,"I just need to vent because my mom will have a panic attack if I tell her I'm gonna kill myself.I was abused as a child. My father was a piece of shit and I'm gonna leave it at that. I developed depression and anxiety because of it. I've been depressed and anxious since middle school. Had very few meaningful relationships and the only friends I made were because I did drugs with them. Before drugs I literally spent all of my time playing video games. Still no meaningful relationships and no girlfriend so I was very lonely.I went to a decent engineering college but my anxiety worsened and so did my depression. Almost got a girlfriend but sabotaged it like usual. My first suicide attempt I called my mom and she talked me out of jumping off my 17 story dorm building. I dropped out of school and got help. Finally lost my virginity at 20 and started feeling better about myself. Went back to school, worked my ass off,got a dog, got a girlfriend, got a job at an animal hospital, and then my life collapsed again. Dropped out and moved back home. Worked at the family restaurant and fucking hated myself. I was still taking antidepressants but decided to try therapy too. Couldn't stand any of the counselors I went to so I gave up. Second suicide attempt I downed a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of pills but I freaked out halfway through and made myself throw everything up. I made some friends and started going out and drinking/doing coke with them. Sent me into another depressive episode. Spent my 24th birthday sitting alone on the beach at night with a razor blade in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other. Reached out to my ex to see if she would take my dog after I was dead and she talked me out of it.I moved to Atl in hopes of going back to school but discovered that my dad withdrew one of the student loans he took out for me without telling me, the payment defaulted, and now I owe the school $20,000 if I ever want to go back to school. It's a long story but everything he did was legal so he just fucked me because I was stupid enough to trust him at the time. Now I'm thousands of dollars in debt, I just got fired from my job because I was so miserable, I have -$200 in my bank account and my car payment is coming up. I doubt I'll even be able to pay for my meds this month. I'm hungry and I just want to fucking die.I can't find the strength to kill myself though. I've started looking for people to take my dog so he has a home after I'm dead but the thought of losing him outweighs any thought of suicide. It would break my mom's heart too. She helped me through this and cares about me. But I wake up every morning wanting to die. I'm numb. My world is grey. I'm trying to get a job so I can fucking eat again but I'm struggling and I don't know what to do.I don't care if nobody reads this, I just needed to get it off my chest."
It doesn't matter anymore,"Doesn't matter. Can't talk irl because physical violence, can't take steps online because my crude language and my hatefull nature."
I feel broken and demotivated and would like to hear about someone's success story of how they overcame chronic suicidal urges.,"I just need some inspiration rn, or maybe even a blueprint to go off of."
upset,"i'm tired of life, i need some tips to get better 'cuz nothing's going better, it feels like it'll never be okay. please help"
Depressed for two months now,"I am a teen with high-functioning depression and everything is getting too much for me to be able to handle. I have attempted suicide one time on july 28 by almost overodosing, but i talked to a hotline and luckily didnt do it. Tuesday night, i was very close to overdosing again, and last night i considered cutting my wrists. I have alot of suicidal ideation. My family emotionally abuses me and i have no support so please dont tell me to tell my family. Suicidal ideation scares the hell out of me. Please does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep fighting this because i am seriously at the end of my rope. Ive been depressed for two months now and i dont think it will ever get better because what causes it wont change. Im really down on my luck and so terribly hopeless and depressed. I cannot explain the pain i am feeling. I self harm also and cut last night.
any help is appreciated. "
"Feel worthless, need a second opinion","I've never been especially motivated (to my repeated peril), but recently (last 4 months or so) I've completely and wholly lost interest in anything and anyone. I feel utterly shattered all the time, and can barely get out of bed, let alone go outside. I spend almost all of my time either sleeping, watching classic films or on the internet, usually drinking at the same time. My family are tolerating it for now but I suspect that they won't forever, and I already find it draining to interact with them on a daily basis. Naturally, I venomously loathe myself for being so useless and passive about everything, and of course all of the usual suspects, no prospects, no experience, no friends (purely thanks to myself) etc, etc. The only occasional bursts of energy are when I spontaneously break something or hurt myself like a child, just as an outlet.
I keep having a recurring dream in which I'm locked in a dark room with only a noose and a chair. I spend a fair amount of my - unlimited - free time researching methods of suicide and am currently deciding between CO and Opiate overdose.The worst part is that i'm painfully aware of how good I have it compared to other people, with parents that would let me just lie about for months whilst barely complaining. It's a horrible feeling hating yourself more than anybody else, and hating the fact that you're too lazy to do anything about it even more.I don't even know why i'm posting this, apart from I feel that I can't go on like this for much longer. Something has to break and I suspect that will be me."
I don't want to be a disappointment,"My dad died very suddenly 3 years ago. My whole life I've worked so hard at school because I knew how important it was to him. He told me university was the best time of his life and he wanted that for me. He left a bunch of money in my name specifically for my education. I'm finally here and I'm messing everything up for myself. I've always had an anxiety problem and it's gotten so much worse since I started. I try really hard to force myself to go to all these orientation events and social opportunities just to stand there staring at my feet. It feels like I'm paralyzed with fear. I can't handle living in residence. I need time to be alone, I don't even feel comfortable crying because I'm worried someone else will hear me. I've probably spoken about 2 sentences total to my roommate and he probably thinks I'm insane. I feel so trapped and claustrophobic all the time. I'm already stressed about the work I have to do for classes and it's only going to get harder. Dropping out isn't an option, he'd be so disappointed. I really just want to end it all so I don't have to feel this pressure anymore. "
Don't know how to keep going any more,"Hi
I don't really know how to start this
I just need to get this all down so people know what I'm feeling and why and if there really is any chance for me To get better and if anyone knows how I can be helpedI'm sorry that it's so long abd whiny and probably seems disconnected but every little thing adds up even though I know this will Miss out so much and things that I don't feel comfortable sharing
And I'm sorry it's written weirdly and I might make it hard to read
I just don't have the energy to write properly and know that if I try to I will never be able to start or finish becayse that's how it's been for me until nowI just don't see a way out of being hopeless like this
I'm a trans girl and my mental health and everything around me has been getting worse and worse for so longI have trichotillomania and it used to show itself like it does in most people when I was younger and I developed a bald patch because of it, but because of my dysphoria when I started growing facial and body hair it quickly turned into plucking and pulling that as wellBut when the hair started getting darker and thicker I couldn't control how much damage I did to get them out so now my face is covered with scars from digging in with tweezers for hours every day
I just wanted to be able to be pretty and confident with my appearance but now I never will be
I always have been unhappy with how I look but during the times I hadn't got as scarred and stay clean for long enough I was happy with how I looked but now I don't even have that I've researched stuff about how to get over trich but it's made for people that are plucking hair they don't want to lose
For me I need that hair to be gone, even without OCD I wouldn't be able to live properly as myself when I have hair growing out of my face
Shaving isn't good enough Nd I can't afford hair removal I've spent the last year or more almost completely inside, so far longest time without stepping out once is six months
I can't be seen like this and even when I can stop and heal for long enough for makeup to help me go out it's still so hard
Just being trans makes others see me as a freak, let alone everything else I have no contact with my family who I ran away from more than a year ago because it wasn't good for me, especially my mum, who lied to, gaslighted, and blackmailed me, as well as sabotaging my chance of getting help from the gender clinic even if they didnt seem to want to help anyway Ive tried different medications for my depression but everything made me feel weird and worse so I couldn't stand to keep taking them
People say that LSD can help but every time I've done it I've had at best a mildly uncomfortable trip, but my worst led to me going to hospital and traumatised me worse than anything i can remember
But I've taken it a lot because it at least means this life is different
At least for a while I've been in some relationships but I found out about something called relationship OCD that I think describes me quite well and is what lead to most of my break ups
My last girlfriend was the first person I could see in real life and I always looked forward to her visits and she was so good to me but after the bad trip I lost the ability to love like that so I had to leave her
And now she hurts too much to talk
I miss her a lot
I didn't want to hurt her I only have a few other online friends but they have lives of their own and can't talk to me much
I've forgotten how to talk to people other than them and how to make friends
I used to make lots of friends and talk to loads of people, even if only really online, but now I can't do it at allI used to have a lot of electronics and stuff to keep myself entertained at least but even though I know to treat my things well everything has broken and I don't know why
And I cAnt afford to fix anything
I live on disability and housing benefits and what's left after food and everything being delivered goes to collecting trading cards because it means that I at least have something to look forward to and almost enjoy and there's always a chance of something good
A chance I don't feel I really get in any other area of my life
It gives me something to focus on
Even if my OCD makes collecting toxic sometimes And I get self conscious for feeling childish
But at least it's something I wish I could save to fix things or get a laptop or something so I could make art again or play games but without lots of small things to look forward to to keep me going I would suffer a lot
I once saved up for a switch by starving myself and selling things that I didn't really want to sell so that I could enjoy something new but it and the replacement were both faulty and when I traded it in CEX took the trade in price down the day that I arrived there and then put the price down again because I had a screen protector on it so I lost a lot of money on that
I feel like I'm not really allowed to be happy or have good thingsI went to pride pretty soon after I left my family but I got spit on by someone there almost as soon as I arrived, and that was a long time before the hate group arrived
Feels like nowhere accepts meI haven't made any friends since I've moved here other than my roommates but I did try
Talked to someone online and it went really well and was supposed to go to a meet up together with some of their friends but when I arrived they  all didn't say a word to me and after they finished their drinks just left me alone
And I really made an effort I was supposed to move out last month with the roommate I get on with better but nowhere would accept me because I don't work so I'm stuck where I am and they moved out The other roommate isn't a bad person but they had anger outbursts and pushed and broke things in the house when I had moved in not long ago and I never really got over being scared of her I once attempted suicide
But was found before I had taken many pills
I went to the hospital anyway and said that I need help and that I think it would be best if I were to be sectioned
But they said that if I Kill myself it's my responsibility and they refused to help meOne of my online friends recruited some of her friends that are good at helping others and know what to do and are quite good activists and stuff like that and one of them is the reason I was able to run away at all
But after a while they all seemed to give up on me
They knew how bad it was and said they'd help and then nothing
I know they do a lot and I don't expect them to drop everything they do for me and I appreciate what they have done
But it hurt more to be dropped like that than not told would be helpedI feel like I'm not allowed to be happy
When I was a kid I got bullied a lot and especially when I was in primary school
Spent at least one year with no friends at all
And when I did get happy or excited I ended up extremely ill
Which i think still happens now
I once ended up in hospital the night before my birthday and I always got ill somehow before most good thingsI was in college for a year and a bit
I got a distinction in my first year but knew I wouldn't be able to cope in a level 3 course because I barely got through that so I took another level 2 in something else but I got kicked out because I couldn't handle it A lot of the time when people try to help me they think I'm trying to be difficult and get frustrated and give up on me
But I promise I do my best it's just that so little seems to work for meAll I've been able to think about lately is self harm and suicide
Wanted to kill myself since I was 8
Only reason I haven't started cutting again is don't have anything shark enough
And usually too scared to try and kill mysskf
But so close to breaking point
Don't know what to do I really do try my hardest to make things better and I know my best isn't that good but I don't feel like I deserve this life
I always try my best to be good even if I don't always succeed
I don't know what else to do
I want to be able to be happy and be confident and go outside and be accepted and have s life and friends i can share good times with I really miss going outside "
Can't get up and put a mask on,"I have class in 1 hour and I can't do it. I promised myself I wasn't going to skip class this semester, but I'm in so much pain and exhaustion. After binge eating to the point I couldn't breathe, I threw up unsuccessfully and chain smoked. I hate myself. I hate this. I can't get out of bed and put myself together for another class and thinking about everything I need to do makes me want to end it. The 5th level of the parking garage seems high enough."
I'm not sure if I still want to live,Sometimes I feel like I just want to kill myself. My life seems sort of good like I go to one of the top schools in my country and I win awards and stuff but im just sick of everything. It might seem petty but I just need to get it out thereI'm sick of my parents always being on my back for not doing well even though I am by most standards. They want me to come first in everything but it's impossible. Anything good I do they never say well done. They always just put me down for being bad at something. I've never been great at sport but I have I do it because it's compulsory at my school and my parents always tell me im useless to the team. They are so over the top with their parenting. I'm not even allowed to watch TV on any day. They literally take the plug out and hide it just so I study. They don't let me have a life and it shows at school. I'm just sick of it all. I'm not even sure if I have friends anymore at school either. I don't feel like I fit in with anyone. I've been showing up to school looking more and more depressed and everyones giving me weird looks. I think I've lost friends over the last year because of how depressed I seem. I've tried cutting myself twice before and the release of pain made me feel so much better. But someone at school saw the scars so I stopped because I don't want to go see the counsellors at school. I'm sort of overweight and fat for my age and height. I used to eat a shit ton more whenever I felt depressed but now I dont eat to punish myself for being so shit. I'm pretty sure im socially retarded. I can't go talk to anyone except for maybe two people. But it's more social anxiety. I'm fine giving a speech in a debate or something but I'm incapable of having a conversation with someone. I'm even more fuckin retarded with girls. Even online to girls who somewhat know of my existence now think I'm a weird creep and it's really depressing to think that that's the impression I give. I just want people to forget of my existence because of things like this. I know this rant seems really stupid but Ive been feeling depressed for a long time. I don't want to get help coz then my parents will be on my back again. I wish I wasn't so socially useless. I don't even know why I'm putting this rant on here. I guess I just want to know that someone will listen.I think about killing myself a lot of the time and I cry myself to sleep sometimes. But I'm also afraid to kill myself and I don't know what to do
I'm so on edge,I can't seem to bring myself to give a fuck about anyone or anything I've got everything planned and this is my last stand if Reddit can't help then no one can I'd give myself 3 days at max.
"Incest, STD, Psychosis, depression.","I'll keep this short. I'm Matt, I'm 19. I was sexually abused by my older brother from the age 5-9.One of my earliest memories is him ejaculating in my mouth. Life goes on, I'm a depressed loner for obvious reason. Meet a girl fall in love. I'm probably 14. Shits good for a while but she cheats on me. We have an on again off again relationship. She's basically a whore but I love her, and she knows I love her, so she uses me.Turn to marijuana for relief.
Marijuana is my best friend. Not your typical stoner, no I love this plant. I learn everything there is to know about it, this plant saved my life, I finally find something I'm passionate about. I finally find something that makes me feel human. Then one day a couple weeks ago, it turns on me and I have a psychotic break down. Diagnosed with PTSD and psychotic depression. Girl hits me up a couple weeks ago. Only girl I've ever been with. We have sex. Now I have a rash in my pubic area, that is probably herpes or worse.My life is a series of bad descions.
Part of me knows it's not entirely my fault, the smarter part of me knows I deserved everything that comes my way. I don't want to die. But I'm garbage. Life is garbage, people are garbage. Fuck it. I think I will turn the cars on in the garage and let it all slip away.There's nothing here for me."
"Looking for help, not for me, but for a friend.","Hi, everyone. I'm looking for advice. I'm 18, and I have a friend that was recently raped. She's 17, and was drugged and taken advantage of at a party. I'm doing my best to be supportive, making sure I'm there for her, but a few nights ago I had to talk her out of killing herself. She has a past history of depression and attempts, and I'm afraid this might push her over the edge, because she's convinced her life is never going to get better. Please give me some advice, because frankly I'm panicking and don't really know what to do to help her. "
Tried to kill myself....,"...and failed, some weeks ago. Rope broke and now Im left with a huge scar on the neck. Thing is... Im just as before, most time what I feel is just like watching paint dry on a wall, a sense of boredom and nothingness, with the occasional burst of sadness and anger, most times coming from drinking whatever I can afford.Some would say that after all of this I should be glad I failed, but I dont, I honestly wish rope hadnt broke, I had already blacked out, so it was all easy from there. Now Im in the awkward position of not being willing to go through all the process again, not my best experience and definitely something I wouldnt want to repeat anytime soon. Dont really know if looking for help, just tired of all the retarded jokes from people that doesnt suspect a thing do about my scar (most got to do with erotical asphyxiation) and wanted to let some unknown know about my little secret."
"Generic, Dramatic ""I wanna die"" title.","I'm not clear on the rules. I want to die. I mean, my mind is made up. I won't bore you all with my reasons, but there is a method that seems appealing to me and would like some people's takes on the matter. But you're all, like, do-gooders trying to keep traffic intolerable. I mean, I don't drive but I am that asshole who makes you wait an extra 20 seconds before you can take your right turn. Wrong place? Or shall we begin?  "
I'm not sure how long I can keep going.,"I have very little social life. I've tried talking to people before and I'll always get turned down.My dad was wondering why and he suggested I had asperger's syndrome and he was right as I got diagnosed. Asperger's syndrome is where the individual misses ""social cues"" and doesn't naturally understand facial expressions or body language which is how humans mainly communicate.Luckily enough, I have a new job where the health insurance will kick in soon and wondering if social therapy will help?I need to do something because if I don't, I'm going to kill myself plain and simple. My family isn't much help either besides my dad. 95% percent of my family are broken criminals out in New York. The other 5% (including me,) are in different states."
School is Hell,"With school having started recently, I was hoping that things could be better this year. I'm on the autism spectrum and I'm ADHD, both of which impact me in a way that increases my cognitive ability, but lowers my ability to focus.Because of this, people always tell me that I'm ""such a smart kid"" and that I ""shouldn't be getting such low grades"", but no matter how hard I try and I can never make myself do any of the homework and I've started to feel like I'm just useless and it's not worth me going on.I know my parents and friends care about me, and I don't want to worry them or upset them, but I feel like I'm being too much of a burden on them right now. Being in the school causes anxiety and I just can't seem to do any of the work and I think I might fail my classes again.I was recently put on antidepressants but they aren't helping, and I just can't get rid of the voices in my head that keep telling me to end it all and not go on, and that I'm useless if I continue to exist. I don't know what to do."
"Nobody can change my mind, not even myself",Im going through with it. I don't feel guilt anymore towards people I'll leave behind. It's time.
"Can we practise an abortion on a 300 months old kid, please?","Why am I so stupid? I've tried them all, nothing works, I'm tired of people following their life plans, I don't have any plans because I hate them all.And more of anything, I hate myselfWhat the f am I in the end? A stupid embryon who should've been killed by the doctor before it was too late. My mother before having me had an abortion, why was I not that child? Doctor, can we practise an abortion on a 300 months old child, please?"
I'm a 28 year old loser,"I have nothing. No job, no car, no money. All I have is school and I'm still in undergrad because I worked for so long in restaurants to make money for school. I hate my hair, cheeks, jaw, nose, body shape and body in general. I have nothing"
I honestly don't see my self making it past 18.,"I just fucking hate life. I'm hanging on for now but barely, only things really keeping me going are my dogs, the fact that I'd like to at least cross having sex off my bucket list, and how shit fucking terrified I am.I'm an atheist (I know right what a surprise, a Reddit user AND an atheist?!), so for me, death is the end. No Afterlife. No heaven. No hell. No fucking 72 virgins or whatever. Just an impossible to fathom pit of nothingness. I sometimes wish i was religious so I'd be less scared to end it.I wish about a lot of things; I wish I had close friends, I wish I wasn't such a fucking jerk all the time, I wish I cared about people and things in general, I wish I had someone to care about with all my heart, someone I cared about so fucking much that it wouldn't matter how shit my life was, someone who could pull me out of this fucking nightmare and make me happy again.I just don't see how I'm gonna make it through the end of high school, let alone UNI, LET ALONG FUCKING ADULT LIFE, when I just don't fucking care about anything.I truly, honestly, do NOT want to kill myself, and please trust me on that. I've being seeing a shrink and I'm gonna see a local GP about getting anti-depression meds, but I just don't know how much these things are gonna help me in the long run. Maybe they'll get me a couple more years, maybe they'll lay me the path to getting a decent ATAR, but how the fuck are they gonna keep me going when I'm a lonely, friendless cunt in a shitty rundown apartment somewhere, with a noose around my neck and a flimsy chair underneath me? Cause that's how I see my life ending, pills or not.So I guess that's it really, a bit of a weird, rambly sort of rant rather than a question I guess but fuck it I don't care, I'm depressed! (Also please don't give me that bullshit about how I've ""got a long life a head of me!"" or whatever cause that's kinda a problem, I don't wanna live a long life if it's gonna be shit tier garbage the whole time, peace).Quick Edit: I'm going out for a bit so I won't be able to answer messages until tommorow probably, cya."
I cant do anything right,From the moment I woke up I cried driving myself crazy contemplating how I should die and thinking how to talk to my psychiatrist so I could hopefully OD. My sister just yells at me telling me I can't do nothing right. It took me hours to convince myself I was happy then I believed myself I was going to go on a trip do something exciting but then my sister comes me telling me I can't do nothing right. I cant be home anymore I just get yelled at. Having thoughts in your head is one thing but once someone else says them out load they must be true. I am thinking of quitting everything from life I cant do anything.
Trapped and desperate,"I have bipolar 2 so im familiar with the rollercoaster of mood swings. I am on meds, but i feel more suffocated with each passing day..like im trapped in a corner and theres only one way out. The urge to die is so strong and the violence of this feeling scares me. I feel like im going crazy, like im going to do something drastic just to get out from the corner.What do i do now? Someone please help me"
Eugenicist here. I think it's time.,"Well, I've worked it through intellectually. I'm pretty much done on this earth. I have contributed a little to society, not very much but what I could. Through some serious analysis, and through the process of natural selection I know that I am not fit for reproduction. I am flawed physically and genetically. There is absolutely nothing that I can contribute to the species via the continuance of my genetic line. I have drained society, my family beyond the point of my worth. I know the standard arguments. I know what people always say. But there is a simple biological truth. Natural selection is natural, and it is unforgiving. I am not fit to reproduce, and I am not fit to survive, but due to the trans-humanist reality that we live in, I continue an unnatural existence. I think it's time to return to the natural order. It's time to go. "
I'm just so tired.,"Playing another round of ""don't initiate a conversation or talk to anyone unless they talk to me first."" As a result, I haven't spoken to any friends or family in two weeks and counting. I never realized how desperate I was for human interaction until I realized I'm the only one keeping myself in each of my relationships. As soon as I stop trying, it's like I never existed to them.My job is unfulfilling, the sort of nightmare that first made me dread entering the workforce: that I'm there for the money at the expense of my mental health. The only things I can afford to spend the money on are rent, bills, etc. It's a cycle of pointlessness.I don't have health insurance and am not aware of any ""sliding scale"" type therapy options in my area. I basically lived in the counseling center in college in hopes that I'd be better adjusted when I got out, as much as they didn't like it. I'd just make up something new to get myself back in there after my however many sessions ran out. It wasn't healthy. It's been ten years and I'm finally realizing that.I have to get up for work in two hours. Or I could just finally embrace the inevitable and never go to work again. I think I'm ready to never wake up again. I'm so tired."
My anxiety has gotten the best of me,"I won't allow myself to do anything I want, all I can think about is what will go wrong and how I'll let everyone down. Im a 23y.o guy that's in fairly good shape, I have a decent job, I'm a musician, and I feel like I'm pretty sociable. I've gone on a few dates over the years but the minute I start to feel close I back away because I'm to afraid to ruin a good thing. I haven't been intimate in 7 years and the more I feel like I'm getting better the more often I look at my life and realize how much of a waste of space I am. I live in south Florida, everyone's worried about Irma but I just hope it takes me so at least my family doesn't have to hear that I did it myself.."
Everyday something comes and makes it worse,"I can't deal with it
The way my life is set up from this disorder existing
And I find new things all the time that makes it worse
I want my life to be over I am unhappy hereI cant take medication
I wish my parents had given me medication when I was little so that I would be betterI cant make and keep real friends and I am mentally unable to have a 'true' friendshipI am too sick to be hereRegular human behavior legitimately freaks me out and it feels so wrong and I am scared of everyoneIm only happy if I work but I feel too desperate for friendship and attention and am too distracted to restrict myself to only workingI just want to be a happy little machine instead of someone with BS ""Emotional Needs"""
"so like, what now","so ive posted here before (a few times) when things have been shit n i felt like dying, but this is slightly different. last night i was 100% convinced i was going to kill myself. i had a plan, i had the means to do so and i was minutes away from doing it. i emailed a teacher that means a great deal to me, saying i was so sorry, that all the support given was such a privilege and i'm sorry i couldn't keep going. she emailed back almost instantly giving me the numbers of support lines, and of course forwarded my email onto higher members of staff who contacted my parents this morning. i didn't kill myself last night (obviously) my friend pretty much kept me in their car until i promised i wouldn't. i was asked to go into school today to see that teacher, who told me she had spent the entire night absolutely sobbing and did not sleep at all. my heart fucking broke. she begged me to go to the doctor for tablets and back to a counsellor. now previous experiences with a counsellor have gone as follows:
'your life is perfect'
'you don't need counselling'
'why you even here?'i feel like fucking shit still, and 100% are still suicidal, but im not going to kill myself today. i want to get better for her because it broke my fucking heart hearing her. do i go to the doctors? get kicked out of school like the senior members of staff are trying to do? what do i do? i can't keep living this life of purely survival with no enjoyment. "
Should I call the police if my best friend tells me she wants to commit suicide?,"There's a group whatsapp chat between me and my three best friends. I'm going to give them pseudonyms to preserve their identity. We have Shayla (me), Gertrude and Camille. Camille has been clinically depressed for a couple years now. Since early last year, on multiple occasions, she has texted suicidal ""goodbye"" messages to the group, thanking us for all we've done for her, but saying she's made up her mind and she wants to end her life, even though she knows it's a selfish thing to do. Now of course we lose our fucking shit every time and go into a panic attack. Because we never know if she's just saying it, or if she's actually going to do it. So here's the thing. Every time she says she's going to kill herself, she never actually does it, and wakes up the next morning apologising and saying she felt ""posessed"" when she texted us the suicidal messages.This has happened at least five times. But frankly speaking, this cycle of staying up til morning to make sure she's fine and doesn't do anything stupid is extremely EXHAUSTING. Because I live near her, I end up rushing to her house to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. Everyone kind of knows she isn't going to do it but nobody wants to take chances either.So here's where the disagreements start. I've decided that the next time Camille sends us a ""I'm going to kill myself, I love you all and thank you for all you've done"" I'm going to call the fucking police. I don't give a shit if she hates me for it, or if she decides to cut me out of her life. A mad friend is always better than a dead friend, and I don't want to be responsible for her death, and know that I made an assumption that she wouldn't kill herself, but ended up doing it anyway. Now Gertrude, the other friend, is telling me I shouldn't. She says leaping to call the police is not a good idea. She says I should find out more information first, then decide to make the phone call. Her stand is that we should personally would talk to her more and try to assess how serious she is, rather than leaping to dial, because we're not experts. Gertrude believes that bringing the police in will potentially make things more complicated for everyone including us, her parents and her family. Now the part that really ticked me off was when Gertrude said that I needed to be realistic, and make educated guesses considering that Camille often claims she wants to kill herself but ends up not doing so. Gertrude is basically saying, she's not going to do it.While I understand where Gertrude is coming from, I see this as an incredibly idealistic way of looking at the situation. Perhaps I am too rational, but hear me out.1) Calling suicide prevention in my country will not get her immediate help. The police respond much faster.2) The suicide prevention website in my country states that if we know someone is in immediate physical danger, we should call the police immediately. 3) The police are trained to do mental wellness checks and can respond to suicide.4) I come from a first-world country that has generally competent police.5) Trying to talk her out of it over the phone is not helpful either, because god knows what she could decide to do while we are not present. (Camille self-harms) I am not a hero.6) Of course, if Camille's parents are around to help her, I don't need to do anything because her parents know how to handle the situation. I'm talking about situations where her parents are not present/sleeping and can't help her.7) I am not interested in making assumptions about Camille's wellbeing. I am also not an expert, and I don't think I am qualified to ""assess"" the situation to determine whether I should or should not call the police. I'd rather just call and let the police experts take it from there.8) I sincerely believe that I should act on what Camille says, rather than speculate her intentions.I am very aware that the actual chance of her committing suicide is not very high. Regardless, I do not intend to be stupid. Maybe i'm fucking selfish because I don't want to feel guilty for not calling the police when I could. Please give advice because I don't know what I should do. I don't want to do anything that would be emotionally damaging. Much help would be appreciated."
"I'm not depressed, I'm just sick of being such a loser.","Male, 27.I don't feel overly unhappy, of course I don't feel happy, but I don't have that sinking feeling in my heart that people talk about when they're sad or depressed. I'm just fed up with constantly fucking everything up and being such a god damn failure at life.I literally suck at everything. I'm not handsome, I'm not smart, I'm weird, I'm physically weak, I'm socially awkward and I always feel like I'm three steps behind in everything. It takes me way too long to understand simple concepts. I always seem to piss people off and everybody just yells at me all the time, even though I have no idea why. I can't understand people at all. People are always either criticizing, bullying or just generally talking down to me. I've had to take shit from people my whole damn life and there's nothing I can do about it. Relationships? I had a girlfriend recently who said ""I'm only with you because I can't find anything better, I'm so pathetic."" You know what was funny about that? I wasn't shocked like most people would be, it wasn't like ""oh my god she's such a bitch."" it was just ""huh, yeah, I get it."" I'm not even depressed I'm just numb because I'm so used to all the shitty things that have happened in my life. Friends? I've made friends in the past but they always leave. I don't feel like I've ever had a close friendship, only acquaintances, but of course none of that is long term.I hate being around people anyway because most of them end up bullying me in some way; calling me a retard, or a loser, or a faggot or whatever.It feels like my body, my brain and everything just doesn't work the way it should. I'm clumsy, I'm slow, I always piss people off and I just suck socially. I can't even hold down a job, I've been fired from every job I've ever had.I did terribly in High school, I'm doing university now but it's just way too difficult. I can't understand anything.I'm not close to my parents, they're selfish assholes who only think of themselves and downplay all my problems. My mother just stresses me out and whenever I say I have a problem she stresses out and makes it all about her, I fucking hate her. My dad thinks men shouldn't have problems and just tells me to harden up, fuck him too.So anyway, I'm not depressed, but I want to kill myself because I'm just so sick of fucking everything up. Imagine you're playing a game you're not very good at, you don't understand the rules clearly, you keep losing and screwing it up and everybody around you keeps getting angry and yelling at you because you fuck up yet you're not sure why. that's my life. Most people would quit that game because they just can't figure it out, that's my life, I want to quit because I can't figure it out.What do?"
Not all that bad if you die,"I am quite damaged, I find joys upon upon other ppl misfortune as long as I deem it not serious enough. I dont care about anyone, not even myself on my worse days, and there's worst. Sometimes I got fixated on problems that will resolve with time, but until then I cease to be productive and functional. I have no energy to pursue things that I love, there's a part of my brain that makes excuse at every opportunity that comes and gone, and there's so many. I got trapped both in the past and future, the ghosts of yesteryear in the prison of tomorrow. You can�۪t escape the past demons, but you can outrun your fate. And thus in wanting to do so, I become suicidal. The ability to control your own fate by ending it at any time becomes too enticing to given up. Or maybe that�۪s what fate has installed for me, that I�۪ll kill myself someday (hopefully soon enough). Jokes on them though, I won't be able to give a fuck if I just die out of this plane of existence (please no other plane of consciousness, or else the curse of being sentient for eternity would suck so bad). The false illusion of freedom is one of the worst thing imaginable. Your future is locked into a fix state and you can�۪t seem to change it. No one can see the walls around you except yourself. You go around trying to find a way to tear it down but the walls impede your effort. You realize that the source of the walls is yourself, as long as you�۪re here, the walls will be there. You then know one way to crash it all down but the opportunity has not presented itself just yet. Yeah, not just yet. But it will someday, in a form of a gun.It�۪s hard to stay positive and think long term when I cant see what over the horizon. Actually that�۪s not true, I do see something. All the roads lead to Rome, and all I see is a bullet through the temple of my head. That�۪s all I see, the end of the road, and there's nothing after it. I want to get there so, so bad though. Can ramble for quite a bit here but nobody cares enough for that. Basically I feel life/consciousness is a prison and I want a way out. There's nothing interesting here. Or to be more precise, there's nothing as exciting as no longer have to think about anything forever. People keep saying life is a gift I say fuck that. The one true gift is freedom, the most intrinsic part of it. Robbing people their ability to end their lives is the cruelest of cruel crime. "
I want to do it so badly and i would have already if i didnt care about the people who care about me,"My life was never all that great but at least it wasn't shit. I'm 19 years old and a sophomore in college studying Computer Engineering, a major which is fucking garbage, but I don't like doing anything so I guess why not. My real problems started 4 months ago but in reality have lasted over a year. Basically a year ago I did some stupid shit and on separate occasions tore the labrum in my right shoulder as well as jarred my back. I've fixed the issues with my shoulder mostly but my back issues persist, and they weren't that bad until 4 months that ago, but then they really started to pick up and I spent my whole summer lying on a heating pad while my friends were enjoying their summer going to the beach and amusement parks and such. I've tried to get help for my back but it's to no avail they say I have a muscle strain which is fucking bullshit. My dad's a doctor and he also doesnt believe that a 19 year old can have any serious back problems, or at least that's what he tells me, he tells my mom behind my back that I probably have spondylosis, an incurable back disorder. I'm just so fucking done, I cry myself to sleep every night wishing I was dead. The quality of my days are based on how my back feels and the Grandma-friendly isometric exercises that I've been doing for weeks and are supposed to help my back pain are worthless. I was so happy and healthy a year ago, now I've lost at least 10 pounds and spend most days wondering why I bother trying to continue. I love my family too much to kill myself but it still seems worth it to me when I'm at my worst. I don't know what to do, I don't know who to talk to, I just want to lay on this heating pad and pass away quietly in the night."
I am done.,"I'm over it. I do not want to live anymore. I'm tired of trying to do my best and life seems to constantly deal me shit hands. I first became depressed when I was 13 (am 24 now). I went through most of secondary school with depression because various amounts of different people bullied me. Once I finished school at 16 I thought it would get better but when a new door opens in my life I feel like copious amounts of shit comes with it.
I'd always had a reason to be depressed or to cut myself, up until a year ago. Last summer was  hard for me. 2016 was a shit year for me, the best part of the year was when I went to a music festival. I'd taken a fair amount of drugs at this festival and once I got home to my family, the comedown was intense and made living at home real shit for a week, after that week it didn't get better. The festival blues are a real thing, mixed in with a comedown and already underlying depression was not a nice combo. My relationship with my parents deteriorated a lot and I was on the brink of becoming homeless.
I moved out of my parents house as it was become homeless or eventually commit suicide. I moved in with some friends and had such an incredible couple of months. Things went south with a housemate and there was a lot of tension and a lot of arguments. We had some other peeps move in and everything's great, I've never actually been in such a good home situation in my adult life before. I don't feel particularly depressed, sure a bit down but nothing to what I've experienced previously. I hate this world, I hate our species and I hate our existence. This whole world is driven by money and your life is gonna be fucking terrible without it. I'm done with working a shit job for bog standard money and getting shit on left, right and centre by bosses. I want my life to amount to something and I know it never will. I can't even find a man that's attracted to me and wants to be with me.
I'm finding it harder and harder everyday to come up with a reason to carry on my life. I don't want to upset my family. The thought of that breaks my heart but I'm physically and mentally tired of trying to fight the same battle after 11 years. My family don't deserve the death of their daughter and my friends don't deserve a death if a friend. I can't carry on this way.
I'm sorry that this is long. I can't tell anyone this. "
I spent all of the last night thinking about killing myself.,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.
I don't know what is wrong with me. I keep having episodes, where I go from happy and interacting with people normally to a terrible...well, I don't know what to call it. It's a very dark place in my mind. And once I go there, it feels like I am sitting in an echo chamber and every single self-destructive thought I have ever had, is being hurled at me. I will go from talking normally to people to being convinced that everybody hates me and tolerate me only because they can't say that to my face, in maybe 5 minutes. And then the suicidal thoughts will come flooding in, how I should kill myself as nobody cares about me, how my death will make everybody happy because then they won't have to deal with me. Last night was the longest such episode I have had yet. It lasted well into today morning, meaning I have been unable to do any work, which just adds onto the stress. Once before, when I had an episode like this, I talked to my big sister about it, she being one of the few people I would trust enough for something like this. I didn't tell her then that I was suicidal, though.This morning, I told her that. I told her, remember how I am down in the dumps from time to time? Well, I have suicidal thoughts to go along with them. Her response was:"" It's disgusting when people think of ending their lives for no reason at all."" I don't know why I am posting all this here, and what I am expecting to happen. All I know is, I spent last night in hell, trapped in my mind with no way out. And I have no one to talk to about it. And I am scared of when the next such episode will come along. Because last night was also the closest I came to actually jumping.Please, somebody, help me."
A,"I don't really have anything to live for. Harvey lost me my job, my car, and damaged the place I was staying at. I haven't been in a relationship since high school (which is something like eight years). Mostly because I was homeless, but also because I have issues.I've never done one of these things, because I've never seen the point; it's not like complaining to the Internet will change anything. From what I've seen, it tends to be the equivalent of prayers and hope. And I know that sounds cynical, but at this point I'm pretty jaded when it comes to life.I'm just exhausted- drained, if you will.Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better, but when? Also why does it always come from people who have their lives at least somewhat together?I don't expect anything to come of this, but  I figure the least I can do is give it a shot.In case you were wondering if I feel any better after venting, I feel about the same but a little more ashamed."
Time to die i guess.,It has been a long 17 years.
My father-in-law committed suicide this morning....,"He was 75 & had health issues.  He shot himself in his front yard.  I'm looking for advice on how to tell my 2 daughters, age 11 and 13.  They knew he was in poor health.  Do I tell them the truth, or would it be wrong to lie and just say he passed away due to his health issues?"
Hate Me,I hate who I amI hate what I do I hate how bad I am at everything I hate how little I mean to anyone including myself I hate how I�۪m one step away from killing myself but I just can�۪t seem to stepI hate all of this
Boy who cried wolf?,"(14f) Me and my mom got into a fight because I told her that I felt like my sister was favored (I told my dad that so he texted her), and that I wanted to die. She's sent me to the psych ward before and knows it made me worse. So she says ""I'll send you away to the psych ward."" She then said that I don't care about any one else in the family and that i'm selfish and difficult. I told her ""If i'm that much of a burden I'll be gone."" So after that she told me i'm the boy who cried wolf and that i'm saying it to manipulate her. Guess what? The boy who cried wolf is dead. And maybe soon if i'm lucky I will be too. I'll prove to my mom that i'm not lying. If I stayed alive it'd be worse. I'm sick of life and everything so...hey. Why not? I'm just born as a burden to everyone around me. I don't even see myself to grow up into the career I want. Don't say what you usually say. I've already heard it. ""You have a future."" ""Don't kill yourself."" ""Stay strong."" ""I deal with the same things."" I'm goddamn tired. If there was actually anything to live for I wouldn't feel this way. :)"
Just my thoughts and reaching out for advice,So its been a year since my ex and I broke up and he got married but I feel really shitty because I destroyed a box full of our memories and a necklace he gave to me when we were 4 months in. I wish I hadn't because its all I had to remember him by. I feel like shit. It was a 5 year relationship. It didn't end on good terms and I know It was a huge mistake on my part. As is everything else in my life. I want to undo it I really love him. All the memories are destroyed though I did that when I was drunk one night I shouldn't have. Any advice on how to get him back? I know it was a huge mistake to let him go. I'm honestly not even sure why I did let him go. No one will ever love me like he did. I cant live with this regret for the rest of my life.
I wish I could live inside SuicideWatch subreddit with all of you.,what I said
im done,school is making me want to die. I�۪ve been depressed for over 2 years and I just can�۪t. I already was in the hospital once for a week. School doesn�۪t care about me so why should I? Life is pointless anyway...I�۪m understanding why people smoke cigArettes hoping to get lung cancer one day maybe...
It's hopeless isn't it,"I don't need to be alive any longer, I'm 22 but I don't believe this is a problem to do with my youth.
I've been depressed for almost 6 years and I've reached my limit, I've thought through all the ways I can end this without hurting the people who love me but there isn't one.
Realising that crushed me.
Now I have the choice to either sit through this hell or finally end the pain I feel every day.
I don't think anyone can understand what realising that I couldn't kill myself without hurting the people I love means, only someone suffering like me knows how much that hurts, it's worse that hitting rock bottom because at rock bottom you have only one way to go and that's up, what we feel is hitting rock bottom and to try to go up will tear your family apart.
I have accepted this but I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
If your reading this then I give you my love, it's mostly worthless I know but it's all I have left to give..."
I am moving out tomorrow.,I don't care if I don't have a home or a job. I will live off my savings apply to jobs. I am not going to do thing THEIR way anymore.
I need someone to talk to,I don't have a single person I can speak with about the suicidal thoughts I have all day every day.
"Sober, no money for weed but it's all that's keeping me going.","For the last year I've been self medicating with weed. When I'm high I'm a completely different person, happy even. This month though it's either smoke or pay rent. I don't know which would be worse, suicide or homelessness?"
Embarrased parents,"Have your parents ever told you they're embarrased to call you their child?
Well mine have when I was 14... I'm 25 now still living in the same roof I struggle with hurting myself.. I have no where else to live but here. I Swear sometimes I'm borderline close to just ending it. I act very impulsive so sometimes the idea gets really Farr.
I'm I too sensitive I mean is it normal for a parent to say that? I'd call my mom a 2 face one minute she's all love and I'm her favorite son (when in front of company) then she'll talk mad shit like wtf... Can I send myself to psychiatric insititude? Like I said living here if just hurting me it fells worst then hell. I have high blood pressure and sometimes I just yell into a pillow till I almost pass out . Which is bad. But I don't know how els to release the angry for pain.
I also smashed me head into things idk... man I need help ... thanks "
Do I have anything to live for? I dont know,"Its really hard to carry on. Im 13 and have anxiety and depression and im scared of everything. I cant leave the house. Speak to anyone without having an anxiety attack. School is just a spiral of thoughts leading me into darkness. People say they care, but do they really, or do they make them selves just not feel so bad by pretending to sympathise. Is it just me but when people say ""i care"" or ""please dont do it"" it makes me feel worse because i feel like they have no clue how i feel and dont know what its like. And when i try to speak to people and seek help, tell them my problems, im met with that phrase which most people like me  see ""such a cry for help.""And really, yes it is a cry for help. Of course it is. Why else would i muster enough bravery to speak out. Instead you crush what little confidence by telling the   everyone i know ""look he cuts himself, and hes depressed by the way, and hes FAKE.""When im told that itll get better, i cant believe it. My life gets worse every day. My family HATES me and has told me before that ""the biggest mistake as a parent was having you as a child."" They hurt me and threaten me. Physically and emotionally. Theres only really two things keeping me going. One is that i just get drown my sorrows in gin, and the others that, after it all, i have a hope in my mind that my family or fake ""friends"" will be sad if im gone. "
Desperately need someone...,"My life has been fucked up beyond belief. I guess i should talk about myself. Im an eighteen year old guy,who is seriously thinking of suicide. Ive went through a lot as a kid. My biological fatger abandoned me when i was five. My mom remarried soon after to a very abusive guy. I was beaten or fucked with mentally all day every day from 5 years old to 11 years old. During that time,my grandparents were mad at my mom for moving out. My grandmother cut all contact with not only my mom,but me and my teo younger brothers. I grew up thinking my mom was the cause of me losing my family. During this period of time,my great grandmother had breast cancer. This was in 2008. I was nine,and i loved my great grandmother very much. My mom was gonna take me. My great grandmother begged us to see her. My grandmother was still mad at my mom. She told the staff of the nursing home that i was mentally disabled and she was afraid id hurt her.
My great grandmother passed away. I never got to see her. I never got a final ""i love you"". When the abysive stepfather left in 2010,two years later my mom found a new guy. I was attached to him. He treated me like a son. Life was back to normal as my grandparents and my mom stopped fighting. Unfortunately,he committed suicide on September 2nd 2014 after years of living with us. I was destroyed. My mom started using heroin. Me and my brothers were alone for a long time. We took care of each other. Well,my moms clean now. My brothers live at my grandparents. Four months ago,i met the love of my life. We clicked instantly,and fell in love hard. Well last month,i started getting more miserable and depressed. She left once a few weeks ago. We got back together. And she broke up with me one last time two days ago. I begged,cried,bargained anything just to have her back. She told me she didnt think we could be fixed. That shes matured and is a new person. Ive been smoking tons of weed for the past few days. It does nothing. I cant talk to my family,they dont sympathize. Smoking weed just distracts me while im blazed. Then once it calms down,the feelings rush back. I dont want this life anymore. I got accepted into college for Radiology. I dont want to go. Ill fuck it up and my family will be 30 thousand dollars in debt. Im literally alone. I have nothing. I am nothing. I have no hope. I have no ambition. All i want right now is her calling my baby one last time. Ive been abandoned and hurt my whole life. I cant even sit in school anymore because im either so sad or i want to rip my fucking skin apart and jump out of my body. I cant take this. Please God just fucking stop this. "
15 and abused orphan,"In 2012 I was 15 my mum was having a mental breakdown over the death of her only sister who died of cancer. My aunts family never liked mine. They were well off and looked down on us because we weren't of their status. After my mother completely changed from loving mother that made me lunch and dinner after school everyday, to complete loveless stranger. I understand she was going through depression as she too was orphaned as a very young girl in a third world country, with no other family but a sister she was separated from and assumed dead. At the time i was a young rebellious teenage girl with tendencies to not listen to anyone. I understand now that I only made things worse for my mother. Skip forward about 2 months I come home from school I was used to not being greeted by my mother having to cook and look after myself and my younger sisters. My parents had a gambling problem which only proved to be worse for us kids. We were poor but not without food or material items. At this point in my life though I was used to being grown up and making dinner, helping my younger sisters with school work, as well as being a top of the class student. I excelled and everyone knew me as a bubbly and bright girl, with big dreams. Little did anyone know the weight of my world was on my shoulders. Of course I was used to coming home and my parents being away gambling all day and night long, though it was nothing new to me it hurt more knowing they were never going to change. Now I'm angry, I have to put my younger sisters before myself, I'm starting to lose marks on assessments that I would often pass with ease because of the time I had to spend cooking cleaning and helping my sisters with their work. I felt like a failure. I exploded one day when my parents where home. I yelled at them saying they only cared about gambling and didn't care if my younger sisters didn't have parents around. My mother was already depressed and not her usual self so this situation escalated to a screaming match. I would never hit my mother or lay hands on here but she would would hit me with metal clothes hangers for such disobedience, scars I have to this day. But I was getting older I no longer cried when I was beaten I would just take it and when they had enough I would go into my room and cut myself. (stupid I know but it was a release, a control I had over myself) it escalated to my mother kicking me and having me in a chokehold with a knife to my throat. I wasn't scared of dying and her slashing my throat, I didn't fight back. She dug her nails into my neck trying to hold me in place. My father was in their room on dialysis for kidney failure he knew she wouldn't actually kill me, and so did i but it still hurt and scarred me emotionally. My older sister was home that day from university. She pulled my mother off me. We then went into my room and locked the door, contemplating what to do about this. We were worried for my mums mental health we decided to call the police. They came and assessed the situation. They thought it best for my mother to stay with friends for awhile, all the while I was told to continue my life as usual. I couldn't. I felt guilty for taking a mother away from her young kids. I wanted her home for that sake. But as weeks turned to months, she still wasn't allowed home. This is the time her hatred for her nark of a child grew. She hated me and only me for sending her away. Even though she only lived a few houses away at this point she wasn't allowed around me by order of police. Eventually one terrible day in July she had tried to run away from her house and kill herself. My father and the friends she was staying with had run around trying to find her. They eventually did and it was around 3-4 am. My father had left her at her house because he was tired, sick and needed to rest. Late at night I couldn't sleep. My mother had come again trying to break down our front door and kill herself in our home, or kill me. At this point I did want to die. Eventually she quit after my father refused to let her in. I slipped in and out of being awake and starting to fall asleep. I heard some rustling in the backyard but assumed it was the neighbours dog again. In the morning around 6-7  my father woke up I assumed to go see if my mother was okay. He opened the curtains of our sliding door of a view of the backyard. The backyard was abundant with grapefruit, orange, apple and lemon trees. I woke up to my father yelling ""oh my god, oh god"". We all got up to see what it was. The sight I would never forget. My mother hanging from the grapefruit tree by a nightgown robe. I grabbed my younger sisters and covered their eyes and took them to their room. I ran out and climbed the tree to cut my mother down. My older sister tried to catch her but she was so high up the impact of her lifeless body dropping to the ground echoed and haunted me. We called the police to come and the ambulance came and paramedics tried to revive her but I knew it was already too late she was cold and lifeless. They took her away and the police had questioned us all. They sent her away to be examined for COD and it was asphyxiation from hanging. She didn't break her neck so it would've taken a long 5 mins for her to die. Her body was set in a way that it was obvious she didn't even try to save herself. Forward to a week later of the funeral. It felt surreal it wasn't real. It still hadn't hit me yet. Then things get worse. My father is taken to hospital for an examination and tests because he has been bleeding and feeling more sick than usual. Two months later we try to heal and my dad is struggling. I will never forget this day. He came through the front door with the saddest look on his face. He embraced me and said he was sorry. He was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He only had 3 months left to live. He was sorry he couldn't be there for us anymore. I always hoped the doctors were wrong, but they weren't. He does exactly as they said on the 1st of December in a hospice, surrounded by all his kids. I don't wish to speak more about this as this still makes me cry like a fresh wound that hasn't healed. It's now 2017, I'm 20 going on 21. I have since been to therapy and on medication for depression and in and out of youth suicide prevention hospitals. I'm still on medication. I'm still cutting. I have lost all hope for a future without the pain of depression and loss. They all say it gets better but it doesn't. I left high school, depressed and alone I got worse. I threw my future away the day I let my mother slip away. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing has helped me since. I've picked up smoking and don't care if I die today or not. I just want to be free from this guilt and pain I have held onto for so many years. I'm not asking for sympathy. I just want my story told. Even if it's on a reddit thread. I want people to know life isn't fair and it isn't easy. Some days are better than most, some days are the worst. I've tried to kill myself but I am reminded of the feeling I had when my mother hung herself. I could never do that to my younger sisters, to find me dead in such a way will surely scare them the same way it has scarred me. I guess what I'm asking for is a miracle. I just want to be happy and have my own family and future but it's like a dark monster is always behind me telling me I'm not good enough and that I don't deserve happiness and life. tL;dr: mum killed herself, dad died of cancer in the same year. Orphaned, guilty and often suicidal. "
"Am I the only one with this sort of ""voice"" in my head?","The ""voice"" that tells me stuff like to stop taking my meds so that I can get some extra insentive to take my life, or to not tell my doctor about certain things. Am I alone on this or is this something alot of people get?It's not a voice, per se, but rather an intrusive thought process, one that just pops up. Its like a tip or a suggestion from an outside person; I don't actually act upon these thoughts. But that doesn't stop them from being there, annoying me."
i don't belong here,"i don't belong here. i don't want to be here. i don't want to walk on this earth anymore, i don't want to breathe, i don't want to talk. i want to be done. no one cares about me. no one needs me. i literally have no one. my signs of depression are so fucking clear and no one cares. i am not needed. i don't belong here. i belong under the dirt and i don't understand why i haven't just killed myself already. i don't know why i'm holding on. i can't hold on anymore. i am trapped inside a nightmare i can't wake up from. I don't know why I'm so depressed. I don't understand why it has to be me. What did I do to deserve such a cruel punishment from the world? I hate being in this body. I hate waking up every morning into this fucking nightmare that I can't seem to wake up from. I'm trapped in a life I don't want to live. I'm sick and tired of being... sick and tired. I hate getting up in the morning to face my enemy-- the world. Many say suicide is cowardly. If that's the case, consider my death as natural selection taking its course. veryone is so excited for homecoming, and meanwhile, I just can't see myself going. I can't see myself being alive much longer. I need to escape, I need to finally be at peace with myself.. and if the only way to achieve this involves being locked away under the dirt-- sign me up now. I am crying for help. I'm worried I'll be shoved back into the mental hospital again. I can't deal with that again. My mom constantly makes me feel like shit for the medical bills and my family during visitations kept calling me selfish for wanting to kill myself. My mom made so many empty promises to me.. and I felt like I could get better but as soon as I got out, shit got worse. At first I thought it was my medication, I know antidepressants make your depression worse at first.. now I'm just convinced that I'm incurable. I am sick of this never-ending cycle of waking up and dragging myself through the day. I'm always so fucking excited to go asleep. I'm excited to escape for a few hours. I dread waking up. I feel so alone. I feel like.. i'm drowning. i can't breathe anymore. depression is eating me up and tearing me apart.. my demons are winning. i think i want them to win. i can't beat them. i jsut wanna fucking die i don't wanna be here please god if you're real please take me i can't deal with NOT BREathing anymore i cna' t  deal with sobbing on the floor i can' t deal with pushing everyone away and making everyone uncomfortable with my jokes ab out  ki ll ign ymself i  wannn a go h ome now the sadness is so unbearable..please fucking hel p me i am going to die im not sure if this post breaks any rules but whatever, i'll be gone soon anyways"
"I want to do it so badly, but I'm afraid of surviving","I really want to kill myself. The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm afraid of not messing up and actually surviving and having to live with that. The methods I have access to aren't guaranteed lethal, but if I had access to a gun (which I don't) I wouldn't hesitate for a second. I keep wanting to feel like I can know what it's like just a little bit so I've been trying to cut myself lately. I say trying because I've hidden most of my sharp knives from myself so all I have easily accessible is a really dull serrated knife which can barely break the skin. I just want to be dead. I've given up and just want it all to stop."
Suicide keeps crossing my mind. I feel like I need any form of advice from anyone. Please.,"I have never been a suicidal or depressed person before in my life. But this last year it just keeps crossing my mind. I thought I was pretty close with my circle of friends at work but today one of them called me out on being greedy, not being suitable for the mentality at the kind of work and that he doesnt want to hang out anymore.I just don't understand what I have done wrong. I buy rounds when we go out, I invite them over for dinner at my place. And I still get all the shit. I must be completely delusional about my behaviour. Apparently he's not the only one that thinks that. I just don't know how I should behave with the rest anymore.. Should I leave them alone? Should I keep being friendly? I just feel like shit and suicide won't leave my mind.Sorry for all this rambeling and if you actually read this far, please help me. "
"29, Lonely and depressed beyond my ability to cope.","I've felt lonely and depressed my whole life, but recently I've been feeling more lonely and depressed than ever, it is very painful, I feel like my soul is getting slaughtered with every breathe I take, I've thought about suicide many times before, but I was always scared of it, I've always feared death, but recently I'm feeling the complete opposite, I'm finding the idea of death to be so comforting and so liberating, it is really growing on me and the only thing that is giving me comfort knowing that it is possible to end this forever and turn to nothing.I ideally would like to live, not with pain though, but I seriously can't think of a way out, I just can't no matter in which way I look at it, I tried therapy, I tried drugs, I tried yoga, I tried a lot of things, yet i'm still here.I have no idea why i'm writing this here, If i want to do it, I should just do it without the drama, but for hells sake, I need to at least say something somewhere, it is so pathetic that I don't even a friend to express my feelings to.Maybe i'm crazy, maybe i am not, what i'm absolutely sure of though, i'm hurting a lot, more than what I can cope with and I just have no idea what is left to do.thank you for reading."
Can you hang yourself gradually or do you have to drop?,Like can I tie the noose in my closet and slowly let it strangle me? Would that work?
What a week.,"Man, I have felt absolutely dreadful this week; two people I know (unconnected) tried to kill themselves, though luckily both failed. I've been drinking significantly every day just to shut up my brain for a bit, which is obviously terrible as alcohol is a depressant, not to mention the other effects. I have been depressed/suicidal since I was about 14, 11 years ago, and have always just thought that I won't do it for the sake of my family and friends. That said, I'm more recently coming to terms with the last thread of my family falling apart and my friends being quite involved in their own lives (that's not a fault on their part, they all have things going on and rightly so). It's just looking more and more like a logical decision to avoid the ever-increasing suffering of my life. I feel like an emo just writing that. My self worth is at an all time low and I think that unless something drastic changes shortly then I'm probably going to jump from one of London's very tall buildings to see if I've developed flying powers yet. Nothing seems to have helped thus far, it's just been sheer will power. "
Only 3 Reasons not to,"I have only 3 reasons not to do it- my kids. But on bad days (today, and at least once a week) I think its unfair to them. Like that's a pressure that they shouldn't have to bear.
Its not like I'm extra or anything with them; not super clingy, etc. No one knows that I seriously consider; that I know how I'd do it.
I sought help before and that was a fucking joke. I missed pay for a week and felt like a freak amongst friends family and coworkers. I'm not making that mistake again. On one hand, I feel I should be here for responsibility reasons; But usually I feel like I screwed up not doing it earlier and I'm only exacerbating shit by remaining. Idk. Maybe give it a year and see what happens in life?I've had decent periods in my 36 years, but by and large my life has been a pile of mistakes and bullshit.TLDR- Is it enough to live for someone else?  "
not in a place to face my emotions right now.,"my family is exppecting me to go back into the house and socialize with people ive never met before. im a city away from where college is starting next monday and i'm in hell from the stress.I wish people could understand and respect personal time and space, but its not their fault, i suppose."
I feel like committing suicide even though I'm not that suicidal in the first place,"I fucking hate pain and whenever I get into a really depressive state, or god forbid I have to lie in bed for three fucking hours because I'm on my period (I know I should see a doctor), I just want to get the fuck out of it. I don't want to experience it. And I've been thinking lately, maybe I'm depressed again, and other things just start fucking up and it's like why is my life worth living? I've had anger issues my whole life, everyone was afraid of me so I never grew out of my shyness, I never formed confidence, my mom had to fucking die when I was 10, I have no one in real life to comfort me (I've been hung up on that for years and I know it's fucking retarded), my only friends (unless you count this guy I talk to at lunch that I barely know) are on the Internet, my dreams got crushed when I was 15 by acting like a fucking idiot (and I have no idea to describe that event in ways people will understand), I have 0 ability to talk to unfamiliar people and look like a normal person at the same time, and yeah sure maybe I'm going off on a tangent on how much my life has sucked to this point, but my point is nothing's ever been that fucking bad. I could've been raped. (pssh I don't even take care of myself, how would that happen) I could've been born into a family that's homeless. I could've...you get the idea. But damn it.I don't see any hope for the future and I could be waking up everyday with a protruding urge to kill myself but I don't have that, I just feel like doing this crap because I want to start over in a new damn body and I want to actually build assertiveness this time, I'm a stupid fucking pushover and I hardly do anything anymore. I know I can just try becoming more confident and all that now but where do I start in a high school with 3000 kids? Place is too crowded. I don't fit in. Everyone here is stupid. What's the point?I'm not going to fucking commit suicide but I sure as hell want to even when I know I don't feel that shittyWho writes this shit"
I'm certain my mind is made up,"The last five or six days now, it seems like at some point soon I'm probably going to die. I've done some great things in the past couple of weeks but I don't feel much of anything anymore.  Despite the people (for the most part) around me in this time, I don't feel good enough. Neither to I even feel alive 99% of the time either. I'm just watching everything unfold before me. Why bother? Not the first time I've wanted to commit suicide, nor have I hesitated to attempt it.. but I'm not sure anymore. There's too much to say but.. yeah, I don't know. I've been alone for most of my life but in the past 6 months or so.. I've never felt so alone. Days aren't even relevant anymore, one thing just merges into the next. I really don't even know who or what I am anymore either.. I really just don't want to wake up anymore."
Last conversation?,If you knew you weren't going to see a person ever again and you could have one last conversation with them - What would you say? Would you tell them about your plans to kill yourself? Or would you tell them you were going on a long trip? Would you just ghost them?
like is any of this real,"What the fuck does it even mean ""real""Inexistence, eternal existence, i don't know which it is but it seems like a lose-lose... everyone else just acts happy and cheery like ""our role here is to help other people"" so what... that doesn't fix anything for us or for them.I can't stop thinking about that and I know nobody in the world does or possibly can know the answer"
Do you believe some people should commit suicide? Bad people? 'Formerlly' bad people?,How far does forgiveness go?
I'm done I'm gonna do it I can't take it anymore,"I was put on this earth to keep losing and I'm in so much pain I just want this to end all I ever wanted was to get away from my "" toxic narcissistic "" hateful m and my father doesn't care about me I can't do this anymore"
Thinking about taking a whole box of benadryl.,My best friend said he doesn't want to speak to me anymore ever. I was in love with my friend and continue to love him very deeply. I was thinking about waiting a couple of months and trying to dm him again but I don't think I can wait that long when I think about him every minute. So I think I want to kill myself and tell him while I do it. Maybe give him some contact information so he can know who to ask if he wants to attend my funeral. I wonder if he'll even read the message. Should I not do this? I really don't see a reason not to. The only times I have ever felt truly happy were the times I was around him. I miss him so much it aches.
"Very quickly, I'm losing motivation to keep on living.","I just wrote a damn essay explaining that title. But guess what happened? It didn't make any sense. If I can't get something as simple as writing a few paragraphs on why my existence is a mistake, I can't do anything correctly."
I just want to end it,"I�۪m 18 & have no future. It�۪s very hard going to school, because of my social anxiety and lasting depression. I get bad grades and I have no idea where to study after school.I can�۪t socialize like normal people do.The thing that hurts the most is that��_ no one likes me

"i just want to die , already have a plan","since i got a hereditary  desease that can kill you , i think im just gonna wait and refuse to go to the hospital , cant fail , hopefully it wont take many monthsi just want to die already , im 20 and i cant remember the last time i have actually enjoyed being alive , i bet it has been more than 4 years already  , im just donei really hope my desease is enough to kill me , i dont want to gamble on taking Blood pressure or sleeping Pills and hope they kill me"
I dont feel anything anymore,"Im 22. No job. No friends.I have no ambition to do anything. I dont have a personallity, i dont have opinions about anything. I just dont feel like i can ever be a 'real' person. I see people on this sub with actual problems and it makes me feel even more pathetic.I sometimes go out for walks late at night and hope that someone beats the shit out of me. I guess i feel like itll knock me back into reality."
I'm going on antidepressants today,We'll see how it goes. Maybe this time it'll help. Wish me luck.
"After posting and reading this sub today, I genuinely don't feel like killing myself.",I guess just knowing there are other people who have suicidal thoughts constantly is magically making me feel less suicidal myself. Interesting.
15m,"I havent been diagnosed so im not going go sit here and tell you that ""I am depressed :( the online quiz told me"" but I feel so sad, I feel sad when sad or upsetting events happen like today, my class learned about suicide in religion and everyones head turned to me immediately and i began to sweat A LOT, but at times like earlier today I get random tsunamis of just ""Why do I even wake up anymore"" and then just try to think out life yenno? I got moved to a new therapist and so far ive straight up lied about my mental wellbeing, I just do not like him at all :( I dont like therapy and I wish I wasnt being forced into going. I just want to ���D I E�ۍand of course as I usually tell people ""There is so much to live for :)"" but I have to spend so many more years in my country and high school. Im in highschool now for 4 years and Its just so god damn depressing. Im so lonely and my life is just a repeat of the same shit day in day out"
How do you deal/process only having ONE thing to live for?,"The last year and a half my only reason for living is my son. I have suicidal thoughts around the clock, and my only fear is going out with pain. I'm BP2, so interacting with my son is something I'm only able to do for short periods before the tempo overwhelming my brain. Only reason I don't kill myself is the bad conscience he'd grow up without a dad. I've been through every medication and combination of them over the course of 15 years. I'm worn down, I'm exhausted, I want out.��Before posting, please, I beg you, don't do the whole ""Hang in there, it'll it better"". I don't respond well enough to medication, and my 2 remaining options are electro treatment or deep brain stimulation, both of which has a chance to alter the memory and feelings towards my last barrier.Edit: I'm 35, my son is 1,5 years?"
I wish someone would have told me it was okay,"I live everyday of my life empty I have no more hope I have little Joy I'm in school it's going fine I'm working at $8.25 bare minimum wage i hate my job I hate school I'm slowly starting to hate life I workout I look good but I'm just so empty inside I no longer even want friends I don't have any friends and the girls I f*** with just
want my money and my family give me some love and support but I'm still empty they barely understand me want me to find God all of every day of my life is getting f***** up or bored out of my mind"
Here again,"I can't live up to my parents' expectations. They're wasting their time, money, and effort sending me to college, providing food and shelter and insurance. I don't even have any motivation to make something of myself anymore. I've only lied to them and let them down and failed to be who they want me to be. They paid money for me to get corrective surgery to stop me from picking holes in my scalp and here I am, years later, still doing it. I can't fake happiness anymore for their benefit, after years of feeling depressed again and again. I can't ignore the fact that my gender identity doesn't match my sex, despite how frustrated and confused it makes them. I can't even be honest with them about how I use a different name for myself outside the house.I sneak around without their knowledge to try and find help for myself but it just leaves me anxious and paranoid. Getting therapy and meds might make me healthier but I'll just be living in fear of when I'm found out. I push everyone away and it leaves my parents feeling angry and hurt because they're doing the best they can. They want me to live with them for as long as possible but all I can think of is running away or dying. I can't even talk to my parents about what I'm going through because they think I'm faking it or trying to manipulate them, which has never been the case. But they are right in calling me selfish, spoiled, and ungrateful. I don't deserve any of the good things they've done for me.Even outside the family, I just burden people with my problems. I'm even back here, repeating myself, because I don't know what to do besides throw my issues at strangers. They're right, I just want to throw a pity party for myself for attention.Maybe I should just end it to avoid disappointing everyone further. One big mistake instead of many more smaller ones in the future to pile up and weigh them down. Preferably before the new school quarter starts so that thousands of dollars aren't wasted on me."
I'm going to do it hopefully in the next 3 months.,"I am about to turn 18. I've made posts about it before, but I absolutely hate the idea of legally becoming an ""adult"" it's seriously depressing me to think about. I don't want to grow up and I feel like none of us are physically adults till our 20's, sometimes later. I'm always depressed about the way I look, my parents and people around me are all miserable, I try to talk to people about my suicidal tendencies and it's almost like they just say ""oh that's bad"" and that's it. I want to end it so badly, I really need help. Please. Because at the same time, I want someone to tell me something that will make me feel better. Also, my neighbors are a nightmare, and things are going to crap all over. I lost someone really close to my heart this year and have been ill for most of the year.Sorry this is a jumbled up post, but I'm just a scared young man who feels like he needs to die and some part of me wants to, but I want to make it through for my family. Please help me...Josh."
I can't be saved...,"I've been trying to fight my depression. I finally started admitting it myself after I became close to killing myself. I have a therapist and I am on medication.I became sick and had to go into hospital for awhile. I had surgery and was released a week ago. I failed some final exams....which made me fail the courses. My last semester..I had to move back home because I couldn't take care of myself or work....I am 22 but despite my efforts....I feel like nothing will go right. No matter how hard I try, something goes wrong.I've been thinking about the the feeling of relief when ending it all....I can't stop picturing it.I'm hopeless and a failure who will only hurt others."
Artist at end of their line,"For the past year, I've been feeling liike my mind has been declining as things start feeling more hopeless and hopeless. I broke up with my ex of last year after it turned out he was an abusive manipulator and also quit my retail job due to mental emotional stress. I've been trying to find job in my artist field as either a character designer or comic/storyboarder but nothing comes up - applications that meet my reasonable ability and where i can live go unanswered. I don't know what to do. I've been told that it's about connections, not the applications that lands you a job and I don't have that, god knows I've tried to reach out to people in the industry i look up to but I never get a response. I was a college dropout due to not having the money and being rejected twice from my desired program. I've been kind of drifting along for those years, doing what I can in hope I'll get noticed and be offered a job. Then i met my ex and for 5 years i wasted time and money on him when I could've used that towards bettering my career and more independence. I feel like a fuck up, nothing I ever do works out or pans out. I'm still living with my parents, I want to live on my own and have a decent job but im having trouble with that. I cant even fathom the idea of an emotional support animal becuase im terrified it will end up ignoring me, being actual trouble that i'll have to rehome it or get so sick that im unable to do anything about it. I dont know what to do - i've thought about killing myself but i cant do that becausei m scared and would rather peacefully in my sleep but my body taunts me everyday by waking up and its a sin to take one own's life in god's eyes. I just want a fucking job in my art career field of my dreams and i dont know if i can even fucking do that because I've tried to help myself and nothing came out of it, no one will give that additonal help to get me closer to that goal - i feel like everything is a waste. Another reason i guess i havent just gone and off killed myself is because i have a beautiful and sweetest LDR partner i want to meet in person someday. But its getting hard man, i dont know what to do anymore. im terrified of my parents going before me and having no home or anywhere else to fall back on. im terrified of being a failure for rest of my life."
My last day,I hate the person that I am ...why was I even born I never ask to be place in this world of I was always going to be a sad lonly person I'm never good at anything the only thing I'm good as is at cutting and feel that I'm still a life of o die who would even bother to cry for me cuz being a life they don't even ask me how I'm I doing they think I like be in a happy world _�΍ Wich for me is living in a dark tunnel not being able to go out i want to close my eyes and never wake up to this life my miserable life I live in
So fucking lonely I can't stand it anymore,"I know that I'm supposed to want to spend time with myself and love myself or whatever, but I don't. I hate myself and I hate spending time alone with myself...and so much of my time is spent alone because I don't have many friends. I don't know how to talk to people in my classes or on campus, I get way too anxious and never know what to say...so I don't say anything and then suddenly it's 3 weeks into classes and everyone has made friends in that class and it's too late for me to try.I don't know what to do. Each day that I spend alone with my thoughts is another day closer to me finally just offing myself. I can't stand this emptiness. No one wants to be around me because I'm bad at conversation and I'm uncomfortably awkward...I don't want to be around me either so I get why I'm alone. I am once again faced with a long day and night of being alone in my room, and I've already seriously contemplated killing myself two nights this week. I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to reach out to that woudn't be concerned with or pissed off at me for doing so. I don't want to leave my room because I've already been out on campus since 8am (its 5pm now) at classes and such and I have pretty bad social anxiety, so I'm fucking exhausted.I don't know what to do...nothing distracts me like I need it to. I guess I'll try and sleep, but that's all I do anymore and it never helps. I can only stay asleep for a few hours at a time and then when I wake up I just feel so sad because I'm awake again.I'm sorry that I'm whining...It's just... I feel so backed into a corner every day of my damn life & I really want to end it all today."
It's really the only option I see,"I don't want to do it but I feel like it's the easier option because I'm not going to be happy regardless. I feel so bad for my daughter who will have to grow up without me but she is smart, brilliant and beautiful. She has the best father one could ask for and she's still little. It won't impact her as much. I have everything I wanted my whole life and I actually don't want any of it. Don't want the husband, can't handle being a parent and just want a career I can give everything and beyond to. But that's not possible like it once was because I'm trapped here with all of this. If I were to leave it all behind I think the happiness would be short lived. My spouse doesn't have the capability to understand my needs. He's never been good with that. My therapist agrees he's insensitive because he's never experienced mental health issues. Each day is a battle and it's not fair for my daughter for me to be miserable all the time. The sooner the better before she gets more attached. "
My sibling told me to kill myself,This seriously might be the last straw for me.
Services for suicidal people in London,"Does anyone know any good ones? I know The Samaritans, Maytree Respite Centre, A and E. Anyone know of any more? Has anyone turned to a place of worship for help when they have been suicidal? I am a Muslim but I don't feel comfortable going to an imam. I feel like they know fuck all about mental illness. I did come across a service where a mosque and an NHS trust work together but it is on the other side of London. It is called the Duha project if anyone is interested and it is based in East London Mosque."
Venting.,"I love life. I love every single breath of it. I love it, truly, dearly. Living every single day is like feeling palms of God caressing you on head, every single day is like a celebration of the beauty of life. For life, it's a pleasure, constant surprise, life is beautiful.But I shall no longer be part of it.
I have schizophrenia. I hurt people all the time, without knowing. Living with my illness is hard, I have to be on meds. The only thing that I think is good about it, is that I can go to the kitchen, pick up the bottle with pills and consume it all. I don't even fucking care. I hate myself so much. I hate being in this world, being alive. It is like trapped in limbo, my soul is bound to this Earth, my soul cannot escape and it screams. I want it to be end. I want every single evil in the world to focus on me and destroy me. I want to be calm, I want to be patient. I want to be able to breathe the last breath of life into the wind and die, I want it so damn much. I don't care about my family, I don't care about my friends. They will be better off without me. I hate myself so much, I hate, hate hate hate hate hate. I fucking want to go away, I want to disappear, I want the bugs to consume while I rot in the soil, I want to be the one with the skeletons, I want my skeleton to be scattered, I want myself to be the one who is not called upon during the Last Judgement. Please, please, someone end this for me."
No point,"I did something really stupid that could get me in a lot of trouble and if i do get in trouble im definitely overdosing intentionally. Id rather not get into details, nothing horrible but if i get in trouble it could potentially ruin my life.Im a drug addict. Will be homeless in 30 days when my halfway house kicks me out. Ive been to like 10 psych wards and when I go i just wish i could stay there forever so i dont kill myself. But they always discharge me really fast because of my drug history and act like my suicidal thoughts are ""normal"". Some days i believe i should be in a mental institution for life...Whatever is after this HAS to be better. It just has to. And if i get in trouble for this it will be my excuse to go out peacefully in a heroin induced suicide. Im 23 and going bald from stress. I imagine myself with no hair and just want to die.I talk to women but im not even interested. Id rather watch porn then suffer the misery i get from social interaction and having to act happy so they keep talking to me.Im just writing... Hoping things look up soon if not i have my easy option.."
Suicide is logical.....,"I've had suicidal thoughts since age six. I'm successful, accepted (which as a transwoman is amazing), independent and working in a job I love... But everyday it feels like suicide is logical. Suicide is painless it eases stress and allows rest. Yes suicide is permanent and I know that stress is temporary but I'm tired of the constant cycle of fighting suicidal thoughts. It sucks that my first thought when pulling up on a traffic jam is "" Is there a way to slam into the trick without harming others?"". It sucks that  my brain jumps to suicide regardless of situation.  I'm tired of fighting the thoughts. It feels like the thoughts are destined to win.  I keep trying to identify little things to ""live"" for but nothing really matters long term. I could die and the world continue to go on with one less waste of life on it. I have a plan and that scares me."
My ex called the cops on me,"The other night I was talking to my ex, more like continuing a conversation from the night before about ending my life. I just can't keep fighting to live anymore, it takes too much energy. Anyways, he called the cops, even though I told him I wasn't doing anything that night, and I was angry at him, obviously, for doing that. I get that he was concerned about me and I understand he did it because he was worried about me but now things are weird between me and my parents. The ride home was very uncomfortable because now my dad was asking questions and my mom hasn't spoken to me. I was never really close with my parents anyway but now I feel even more alone and now I'm stuck. I feel bad about putting my ex in a position where he felt like he had to do that so I've forced myself to stop talking to him. I'm completely alone now, I can't let myself feel anything, and I still want to die. I don't really have anything to live for. He thought he was helping me but it's had the opposite effect. I just need to pick a day now. Living is simply too painful."
They say it will end soon...,but the torture Is the process
I thought college would make things better,"I'm away at college and I had nothing back home until a year ago.
I was able to escape from my abusive home life and my trauma related to being molested as a kid through dance. My dance teacher became the father I wish I had and I got other mentors along the way too. I even met bill Clinton at one of my performances which was in front of hundreds of people and also got to perform at Madison square garden. But don't get me wrong, life was still hard. I still wanted to kill myself.
I  started fall in love this summer and now he won't talk to me anymore and I had no closure because I was never given a concrete reason. He was the first boy I've met who has treated me how I deserve to be treated and now he's in a different country and it hurts when I think about him. And IM wearing the necklace he wore right now and it's the only thing that makes me feel safe sometimes.
I also lost control and started harming more this summer but nobody knows that because even though I know it's a good idea to get help, reporting this means being in more college debt and suffering at the hands of my family for longer so I'm trying to power through. If getting help was a rational option, I would go for it.
But then I go to college and it's great here because I don't have to regularly interact with the people who molested me and my horrible disgusting excuses for parents as much but my plans fell through and I was misinformed about the dance opportunities available for me on campus. Long story short, there's a possibility I won't even be able to take ballet, let alone hip hop, which is what I took back home and what helped me through dark times. And I hurt my ankles so I can't even dance in my free time just for fun for likely another week at least.
The only true friends I've ever had in the long term are back home. My mentors back home told me to call them when I got to college, but most of them won't even answer my texts. I get that they're busy. They're talent managers and directors and choreographers and higher ups in the business, but they are also the first people I've ever been able to deem real family and we have a deep bond. They are the reason I am who I am today and want to kill myself much less often than before. Especially my dance teacher. Often whenever we said goodbye to each other we would hug and say I love you but now he doesn't even text me to say he can't talk on the phone. I'm not being clingy. I'm trying not to be a bother but I just need them right now. Is just wanting to say hi from time to time irrational?
I feel like I'm losing everyone all over again. This shit has happened twice before.
I have quality friends back home that have changed my life but I'm not comfortable telling them about how I have been abused and how the boy I love and who love(or maybe loved, depending on the reason why he's done this)  stopped looking me in the eye. So I'm just kind of here in college and honestly I had a tough night. I tried out for dance team and I did horribly and hurt my ankles so that's another door closed with dance and also I did a Tibetan bowl meditation and if any of you guys don't understand meditation, just know that this specific kind often lets you see visions and I had a really depressing vision having to do with the boy I love. It had to do with me re meeting a night recently where I was outside in the cold for 3 hours calling anyone I could think of to talk to them about how much I was hurting but nobody answered until the very end of the night. I called all my mentors and still none of them have texted me saying sorry they missed my call.
And people here at college are nice, so much nicer than the people I regularly interact with back home but they don't know me well enough to understand just exactly how this is all tearing at the seems.i thought college would be a better place for me and it was at first but after tonight, it's safe to say that even though some  things got better it evened out cuz now a lot do other things are getting worse.
I haven't let myself self harm in the last few days but it's really hard not to. I don't really see a reason to keep going anymore, and I'm really good at  finding reasons to keep going. If things are gonna be like this for the next four years, I don't wanna stick around because by the time it does get better I'll be too fucked in the head to appreciate it.
I won't kill myself tonight cuz I never do cuz I'm too scared but I'm afraid that I'm gonna hurt myself and get yet another scar and I get really sad when I look at my self harm scars. They are all from this summer.
I don't really want to be alive right now
Sometimes I feel like the only way my dance teacher would send me a message is if he found out I tried to hurt myself and that's what makes this so tempting. The people I miss would actually talk to me more if they heard about me trying to kill myself. I don't want to make them sad because I love them but I'm so fucking desperate just to get a ""hello how are you I'm sorry I haven't bothered to reply to your messages but I still love you"" I'm willing to go to great lengths. I'm scared of myself right now. I know these are toxic thoughts but honestly I'm so desperate to talk to the people I love that trying to end my life is starting to seem worth it. "
I am a lair; I seem like I am the most put together person when really I am decaying,"I am the person my friends and family for advice and help. I always help them with anything. I am the person that seems like I have it all figured out and I am so happy. But I am dying inside. I feel so lonely and isolated from any true connection. I cannot turn to my friends because I am their rock at the moment and my step mother (my rock) will just judge me and make me breakdown... I know that if I didn't seem this way... more so I feel like if I don't seem valuable to my friends and family they will drop me. Mostly because it has happened. My family has taught me that it is weak to have these thoughts and I should just suck it up.. but I have been doing that for years and the thoughts are like waves and crash hard.. at times drown me. I don't want to die but I don't want to wake up. I don't want this false sense of the happy life... I am not happy. I am 20, fat, and weird. I am creeping this poor guy I am into out because I am SO FLIPPING DESPERATE for a human connection that isn't fake I come off desperate.  "
Saved up enough money for my suicide.,"I don't have job, so I had to cash in bottles and cans to save up the enough money for the method of suicide I chose. The money is currently sitting in my wallet as I plan for the perfect day to commit the act. "
I do t think I can do this anymore.,"I'm on my period using toilet paper for tampons, , I haven't eaten in 4 days because I'm broke, my best friends have given up on me, my medicine doesn't work. I can't anymore.  My abba has cancer. I'm done. "
I'm sorry.,I'm just... I'm so sorry.
I'm starting to lose it,"I've messed up my life. I've gained a bunch of weight and going outside of my apartment is turning into a bigger and bigger problem. I only grocery shop a few minutes before the shops close to avoid as many strangers as possible. I haven't done laundry in about a month and every day I don't do my laundry it get even harder. Because of the smell.
When I go to bed I can't sleep. I go to bed at midnight and 3-4 hours later I get out of bed because I can't fall asleep. I get so incredibly angry and stressed because of it. I have to wait until I'm 100% exhausted or I won't be able to fall asleep. And if I actually manage to fall asleep then the construction outside my apartment starts making some incredibly loud noise at 6 or 7. I'm losing my mind. My 10-year anniversary for my depression diagnosis is coming up. Seems like the perfect time to finally get some peace."
I want to kill myself right now but it's my sister's birthday and I'd feel like an asshole.,"My best friends wedding is in October. Because of how hard my job's been recently I keep on telling myself I can't do anything till after that. I was there for her a lot during a rough time In her life, it would just destroy her to kill myself before her wedding. I don't think she would forgive herself for not being there for me. And her happiness is one of the most important things in the world to me. So don't be that asshole. The people we love can't help us sometimes but the love we have for them is what keeps us going sometimes. "
Nothing seems to matter anymore.,"I just feel so detached from everything and everyone. I am always the one blamed. I don't really think I have a reason to be here anymore. My family hardly cares and I don't have much going for me. Anytime I get excited for anything my life fucks up. I just don't have much family. Or friends who care. And everything is always shitty. I don't feel like I want to be here another day. No one seems to ever care about my needs, and I have no one on my side. No one ever seems to want to look into whag I need or cares about how I feel. I just am a burden to everyone who knows me. No one cares if I exist anymore. "
Tonight I felt I could just die. My heart hurts. I could cry all night. I don't want to feel numb or this horrible pain anymore. So I'm accepting what is. I'm going to give myself time to heal. I want to feel this pain and deal with reality instead,"How are you doing? I'm right there with you... Haven't even climbed into bed. I've been just sitting next to it, picking my toes and staring at the floor since I got home from getting my things I left that her house months ago as a promise that I'd would be coming back.But the promise was that I'd be coming back for HER... I don't care about my damn speakers. I'd give every up, just a sliver of a hair short of my own life, to have been have been able to even seen her with my own two eyes tonight. But she was convinced I'd be lost and gone forever and opened herself up to the possibilities of finding Love I someone else. She's a beautiful, funny, attractive woman. Sadly, it didn't take long for someone to find her.I'd been looking for ""her"" for... 8-9 years. She's the first person that I truly opened my heart for since the last one. I'm afraid of what may lay ahead for me. This oneade  realize the Love I had for the last one was just Childs play... This one enlightened me to the reality of true, unconditional, absolutely committed Love.And I, myself, Fucked it all Up. I wish she would have just genuinely asked me to just come home."
The first day of Senior Year truly made me realize how lonely I am.,"I beat depression, but it came back this summer. Senior year began today, and it really showed how lonely I am. An even smaller circle of friends this year - people I used to talk to ignoring me on purpose. I don't want to go on like this, it'll only get more painful than it already is. I can't embrace the life of loneliness. I want something I can never achieve because of some stupid reason society over-values like my looks. The only answer I have is maintaining my hatred for everyone else who ignores me, and school in general - or committing suicide to take myself out of the misery. "
Why does life feel like a movie that has been on for way too long?,"I don't feel like killing myself as much as I just feel disappointed by life itself. Nothing is new or exciting. Nothing is stimulating. Everything feels like it is either predictable or simply happens for little to no reason. How do people get fulfillment from existing like this? How are people able to build relationships with one another when there are so many obvious flaws to life that have simple solutions but will never actually come to light? All memes aside I feel like I am taking crazy pills and like I am the only person still actually paying attention to what's going on around them, as arrogant as that sounds. What the fuck is this world and why is it so void of reason."
"I'd rather die, than divorce","I love my wife, but I hate being married to her. Her depression affects mine and vice versa. We are slowly making each other miserable(er).But I don't want to hurt her by asking for divorce.Frankly, I would rather die than hurt her that way. I would prefer to just rip myself away by violence, then admit to her face how she contributes to my pain.To be fair, she is a lovely woman and a very good wife, when the depression isn't eating away at her. To my discredit, I am not the best husband, regardless of my depression. I won't go into specifics, but suffice to say that my failings as a husband have excacerbated my wife's already potent depression.TL;DR I would rather kill myself, than admit to my wife how miserable I am."
Always sad and depressed,"I've been depressed and felt suicidal for years. I was at the very moment I was going to attempt in 2012, but got interrupted while trying to carry out the act. (Someone came home so I acted totally fine) from 2006 to that point my life was flipped upside down and I spiraled out of control, I drank a lot and took what ever medications I could get my hand on to make me feel ""lost"". 2012 I had a lot of medical issues and had to make a lot of adjustments in my personal life (sell my house, move home, quit my job) as I had surgery on both my feet. From that point up until now not a day, not an hour goes by that I don't think about suicide. Back then I was in such an awful relationship that to this day still has me fucked up and I still won't date because I'm scared to get close to anyone. I'm hurting people's lives that I'm close to because I can't help myself and make my life better. I always think of suicide but especially from the fall into winter it gets worse. I'm in college and don't know why. I'm the furthest thing from an adult that I can think of and can't seem to get my shit together, I want to end it all but am scared I won't actually die, so here I am, alive still and hating every day of it. My depression has come back in full swing and I struggle to do daily tasks most days it sucks. Maybe one day I'll have the guts to just blow my brains out, until then though I'll just suffer silently "
This sub actually saved my life,"A few weeks ago I just couldn't take it anymore as a 17 year old 76k in debt no friends no one I can talk to and have basically no talents so I was gonna do it, I went on  and lied and said ""just curious not for me but how does one kill them self with no pain"" 1 person replied to my post saying ""Suicide is a permanent loss for a temporary problem"" or something along side those words and put directed me to this sub. I have no idea how he/she knew even tho I clearly said it wasn't for me any ways I came here and shit you not those words will stick in my mind Suicide is a permanent loss for a temporary problem after coming here I realized every thing can change I can one day find friends one day pay off my debts and I believe I can finally be happy one day AND SO CAN YOU guys please if you feel suicidal please get help talk to some one I've been in your shoes I know how it feels ik it's hard out there but please just please. (Sorry for bad grammar English isn't my first language) Edit 1 : I had a lot more problems as well not just being in debt and having no friends."
Figured out how I'd kill myself,"I can barely take this anymore. I don't even know what good posting here will do, I just need to get it off my chest and I don't want to burden anyone. If I kill myself I hope it's soon. I see no future for myself and my friends are growing ever-indifferent towards me as the days go by. As my title said, I've decided the most efficient (for me) way of going about ending it. I don't know how much more I can tolerate. Between the things I can't help but remember and the things that are currently happening to me and the people around me that I'm helpless to stop, I want to escape. I want to be free from this bullshit. "
Its kinda funny,You can talk about wanting to die in a hurricane and it's all fun and games but talk about wanting to take a gun to your head and pulling the trigger suddenly it got uncomfortable
I hate asking for shit like this but...,I just really need to talk to someone. I don't have the energy to type my whole story right now- if you're interested just scroll down my past posts and you'll get an idea. I normally prefer the sanctioned suicide sub but it usually takes a while to get a response there and I really think I need someone now. I feel like such an asshole asking for this. I'm emotionally exausted so I apologize if this is vague.
I escaped a 72 hour suicide watch hospital...,So yesterday my wife called and told them I felt suicidal hoping that if they did anything I'd get a script of xanax or something. But no the dr wanted to send me to some bullshit facility that I've been too twice. They are there for their paycheck and that's it they don't give a fuck about you. Anyways I'm feeling fine I told them I wanna go home dr said I have to go no matter what so I took off my hospital gown and for some reason they forgot to take my bag of clothes so I put my clothes back on and made a jet for the door I'm a pretty big guy so I guess the female security didn't want to fuck with me anyways I make it deep into the woods and spend 3 hours next to a main highway seeing cops going up and down for about 30-40 mins I still have my phone so I made a call to my friend who picked me up I had to go through thick ass woods ended up with cuts all on my legs and shit but I made it to my friends vehicle and now I'm staying at his house out of state. Im wondering how long before I can return to my house without going to that bullshit place I'm fine. They showed up to my house and told my wife that am not going to be charged with any charges for breaking the law they would just try to take me back to the hospital and re-evaluate me with they stop looking after a week and it just be considering a missing persons report? Thanks
Day 1: Realizations,"I woke up today. I could tell it was going to be another horrible day because. . . well, O woke up.My room is a mess, I cannot find any clothes for work, my rabbit, gnawing on the cage as usual.
I feel so bad for her.
I love her, I really do but I never spend time with her.
I'm looking for a good home for her. She's so fucking beautiful and sweet. I'm a piece of shit for not loving her more.
The best thing in this play doh life.I just distance myself from everyone and everything.
Everything feels fake.I think something is wrong with my eyes or my head, but everything looks fake too.
Like I'm looking through lenses in a body that isn't mine. Like a camera out of focus.I honestly wonder if I am real, or anything is real.
If I end my ""life"" I will wake up and be in my real life.
I feel like I am locked in a very long, tiring dream.I had planned my suicide for about three years now. I told the few buddies I had what's going on with me.
It motivates me to go through with it even more, because now I have something to prove.
They're upset, of course they are.
I felt bad for them, but they're not real either.My ""father"" asked me for the first time in 3 months if I was avoiding him.
I almost laughed in his face.
He asks me now?I lost weight, a lot of weight. I thought it would help my confidence and make things easier. It doesn't. Don't let anyone fool you.
I'm sure eating well and exercise works for some people, but for me it was just a feeble attempt at changing the inevitable.I started smoking marijuana. The medicinal properties are amazing. Better sleep, it makes me actually eat, not to mention how the rock that sits in my head feels so light. I wouldn't say it made me ""happy"" but it definitely did more for me than any medication, counselling or healthy lifestyle ever has.
Too bad there is so much stigma around marijuana. It's honestly just as bad as mental illness.I honestly wished I had started smoking sooner.I always told myself people who kill themselves are week.
That, that isn't me. I am strong.
I still think I am strong.
It's just that this life is not for me.
It doesn't even feel real.7 days and counting."
Reality is keep betraying me,"I've fallen inlove with a girl. I really love her because she made me feel so alive and she made me feel so safe. She made me feel safe whenever she's around. She cured my depression. This girl is also my bestfriend we've done many things together and those times where the best days of my life. She meant alot to me. But then that day comes i confessed what i felt about her but she rejected me because i didnt live up to the standards of what guys she likes and our values are not the same, i was willing to change myself to that guy she wants but she doesnt respect people who doesnt seem to themselves. I really want to be with her she's everything to me but no matter what i do nothing will work. The depression she took away from me has  been returned to me in ten fold. This pain that have been inflicted to me is too much for me to handle. And i believed that the only way to get rid of this pain is gouge out the sickness in my heart. I've got a kitchen knife with me and i'm gonna stab my heart with it after i finish my last drink of alcohol."
What if it was your family or friend?,"If someone you were close to killed themself, is there anything that person could've done to make they're death easier for you?"
"Just don't know why I'm here anymore, I'm 18 have no friends don't talk to anyone and hardly have the balls to buy things in a shop on my own","Just don't know why I'm here anymore, I'm 18 have no friends don't talk to anyone and hardly have the balls to buy things in a shop on my own, I'm just sick of it, feel like I'm retarded and everyone around me is laughing at me behind my back, haven't even had a conversation with a girl outside my family for like 2 years, just want to give up"
I really don't know what to do next,"Hello , I have to turn to you because I genuinely feel like i've lost all hope and reason to really stay alive. I'm 16 years old and have been heavily depressed/suicidal for a good 4 years now. I struggle immensely with aspergers and social anxiety and that has hindered me severely with trying to ""fit in"" or ""be normal"". I was in a lot of discontent with my life but I managed, believing that i could just soldier on and almost suck it up in a sense; however when I finished high school I had a lot of time to think and reflect, and to be quite honest with you it has really accentuated how utterly dull and mundane everything around me has become - food doesn't taste as great, music doesn't sound as great, nothing feels like its good anymore. I debated very heavily to end my life but in all honesty, I really don't want to fucking die. When it chooses to, life can be such a wonderful place filled with joy and beauty and substance, but that euphoria has become very short and very far apart. I recently started higher education to try and maybe get some purpose in my life or try and distract myself from the sadness/suicidal thoughts by being a more academic person, but that in term made it a lot worse because it again acted as a catalyst that reminded me at how awkward i really am. I feel really dumb because I can't really concentrate much in lessons and therefore I miss out on a lot of learning. I feel really anxious because I always feel like people are looking at me and judging me and every time i walk past someone laughing i instantly assume it's about me. I feel overwhelmed because everything caught up with me very quickly and i feel like my sadness is starting to eat away at any chance of getting better. I tried professional help but it didn't work and it made me feel worse about myself because i felt like a big burden to my family.I really have no fucking idea what to do /sw/, I really want to live and be content with everything but the sheer idea of things being the way they are makes me so very depressed that it's starting to affect my physical health too; my hair is falling in clumps, my skin looks like utter shit, i'm steadily gaining weight, my self esteem is dropping to basically nothing, i always feel tired and unmotivated.I'm just so sick of it all. If you read this far then thank you, and I hope you have/had a wonderful day."
Will my work compensate my family if I kill myself on the job?,I'm nothing more than a finicial support to my family. So id like to figure out ways of making sure their going to be good money wise after I pass. Or at least have the funeral covered.
Never good enough.,"All of my relationships end in cheating and after I break it off with them for it, they eventually come back and say how much they regret it and they made a huge mistake. So why the fuck does it keep taking me being gone from someone's life for them to value me. Maybe that just means it's my time. Not a single one of my friends texted me for my birthday. Just my ex who I recently found out has been shoving dicks in her mouth left and right, and my mom. I'm tired of being unappreciated and tossed aside by literally everyone but my relatives. All I have the energy to do is get drunk and sometimes eat. I can't do this much longer."
It's been 5 years...,"Five years of hating myself off and on, of struggling to want to wake up in the mornings, of realizing I have a problem and never getting help. It's been five years of misery and sadness. And I want it to be over. The last two weeks have been especially bad, with school and work piling up and keeping me from being social. I don't want my job, I don't want a college degree, I just want it to all be over. I'm tired of pretending this all exists. It's been 5 years and I'm not willing to live for another 5 days. Good night and good bye."
I am lost,"My mother died less than a year ago. I have not recovered. My father doesnt seem to care as though he is 79 he has a new lady. Suddenly things he used to take care of around the house take a back burner. As well as my mother being my confidant. My father couldn't care less as I walk around constantly in tears and with self inflicted cuts on my arms.
 I have always had trouble with depression and this has thrown me off the edge. I used to say the only thing keeping me alive was not hurting my father but now I don't think he would care.
I am trying to keep hope alive, I am failing. My struggle now is to figure out a way to die with out causing trama to anyone who would find me.
I don't want to be like this. I can't find solace. I need help."
_________ _____,"Have you ever loved someone you didn't know very well?I'm the only fool who does. Everything about this man makes my abdomen cramp up when I feel he's near. And when he smiles it's like he's opened up a bright new world. He has the sexiest tone of voice I've ever heard. So calm and soothing. And warmest demeanor to where I don't even feel cold anymore. I wanted to know everything about this man. I mean even if he gained 400 pounds I would still love him. Even if he lost his limbs I would chop mine off and offer it right up to him. (He probably wouldn't take it) even if he couldn't use his spine and lost all uses of his lower body. I would take care of him because I love his demeanor. His spirit, his attitude, his insides. His voice. I wish I could be his shadow. I would sacrifice my own happiness just to see that big bright smile. Just to see him reveal a new world to me. I would trade my life for his and my soul would be up for sale to the most sinister deity. But I'm too dark. Too tall. My hair feels like a Brillo pad. I'm too ugly. I'm poor. I just want to crawl inside myself and die. And come back as someone he deserves. I'm just a dog. Barking here because no one will listen in real life. I'm just a stalker. A loser. Degenerate. Freak who doesn't even deserve to live. No one will read this but if there is one I know you'll ask ""where's your self esteem?"" "
Oh where to begin...,"I've been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth  This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family, and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird, out there, bad, ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me. But I just shrugged it off and kept on going.  Then in middle school I started getting bullied, couldn't walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy. Then I was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit. But I just kept going.And then in 8th grade I went back to school, and finally made friends. People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me. But I actually made friends.Then in high school everything got better at first, I had tons of friends who I considered family. I wasn't being bullied (to my face). And I was actually happy.Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia. I became extremely irritable, I was sleeping in class, wasn't shaving, dressing like shit and so on. Well I didn't know this at the time but my cyclothymia (""lesser"" version of bipolar disorder) had kicked into 12th gear. What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist. So I was getting medication. But can you guess what meds I was getting? Just anti-depressants. And for those who don't know, ADs + cyclothymia or bipolar disorder = (in my case) hypomania. What fun. Basically for 3 years I was mostly hypomanic. I'm sure you can all guess what this was like.  Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance, this got mistook for narcissism. And a certain (true narcissist) didn't like this. So he went around to all my friends (who I considered family) and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me. Which of course I didn't, I saw almost all of them as my equal.  And then it gets better, he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together. But there's no scar. So I must be lying. Even tho it did really happen. I'll find a way to prove it to you if you don't believe me. . He told everyone this. So practically overnight my family was gone.  My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope, I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep. The fallout is obvious.  So I'm left alone, addicted to xanax, going fucking mad from sleep deprivation, and I dropped out of high school.  9 months later I had a nervous breakdown, cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder. I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls. Smoking tons of weed to cope. Struggling with xanax and ativan. And I have no one. Not a single person.What's the point. None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this. I ruined everything. But no. I'm apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends. I just ruin everything."
Living life is pointless and not worth the effort. Soon I will be dead.,I won't allow my self happiness because it's all lies.
Morality,"I've already made up my mind about suicide.  In March I lost my boyfriend to cancer.  He was the most important thing in the world to me.I know my life is over.  I'm just not in the grave yet.My question is - aren't there times when suicide is the best possible option?I'm becoming more bitter and sad with every passing day.  Why should other people be burdened with that?  Isn't there a case to be made that it's actually a good, even moral thing to remove oneself from this world?  Especially if you have no further purpose and can only make other people miserable?"
I just dont know who else to talk to. I just want to vent. (probably going to be very long),"Hey everyone. Never thought I'd end up on here...but here I am. I just need to get my words out before I go insane. I don't even know where to start. I'm a 23/M, and I want this all to end, for real. I've been feeling like this on and off for about 10 years. My first suicidal thoughts started when I was in 7th grade (~2007), and I've had a few breaks from it, but they always come back harder and harder. I'm starting to have really bad thoughts and I can't focus on anything. My manager at work has had to talk to me about my performance. I really think that if my brother wasnt a manager there, I'd be out. (Yeah, can't find a job on my own. Nepotism has gotten me pretty much every job I've ever had.. lol)I don't mean to get too intense here, but I have recurring thoughts of blowing my face off with a shotgun.  I can almost feel the  go through my body, and sometimes it makes me cringe.  Thats not how I want to go, though. Something a little more peaceful. It's an image in my head that is stuck on repeat. Like a song stuck in my head. I always struggled in school ever since I can remember. I was put on medication to try and help me focus, but it just made me feel sick. All through my childhood I had to take all these mental tests, I had to go to speech therapy because I couldnt talk right (I still have trouble pronouncing some words) and I had to see a doctor all the time,  so she can ask my mom how I've been doing in school. If I wasnt doing well, they would up the dose on my medication.. I think it was ritalin or something like that. I was almost left back in 7th grade, and I barely made it out of highschool. I tried to go to college (4 times), but always flunked out. Now, I get to watch everybody I graduated high school with go be succesful people. I just ran into an old friend, actually. He's an accountant in NYC. Another is now shooting music videos for an artist I wont tell, but you've heard of him/her.Now, I was lead here because I feel like I'm breaking down again. After 6 years working jobs I HATE, I thought I had it figured out. I decided on a whim I was going to take a flying lesson, and I was hooked. I started going back for more, and I actually started to take it seriously. I felt happy, and in control. Like everything was going to be okay. It gave me a break from my head for about a year. I studied for almost a year about weather, aircraft performance, how airplanes work, etc. I really, really wanted to be a pilot(scary, huh? I can't belive I actually thought that was going to happen..I feel humiliated that I even thought I could be a pilot..It was a good distraction though). I was in love with the idea. I have many books about planes, I watched every video on youtube,and I even got to fly solo in the airplane I was training in. Life was good. I was so happy I found what I  loved to do.Well, I just found out I wont be able to fly anymore because of a few disqualifying medical conditions (both mental and physical) and  I honestly feel I've been seriously crushed. I really feel that this was the tipping point for me. All the thousands of dollars I've spent. All the countless hours studing and putting my heart and my soul into flying.. all for nothing. Now I'm stuck at home, broke,  living with my parents, making almost minimum wage working a job I . On top of that, I cant keep a relationship. Every girl I ever get involved with loses intrest SO quick and bails. I'm severely under weight, everything is a mess and I really just don't have any energy left. I'm spent. I dont know how much longer I can stand to get out of bed and go to work. I just cant stop crying and thinking about how long it's going to be before I pull the trigger. I just feel like a pathetic, dumb person, and I honestly have NO reason to think otherwise. I have nothing to show for anything. It's hard to look anyone in the eye, because I just feel so embarassed to be me. I feel like actual scum.Now, its not immenent, I know that, because I refuse to kill myself in my parents home. That just aint right. I'd have to get a place of my own, sell my stuff, say goodbye to everyone for the last time, and check out. Thats gonna take some planning. I'm way too afraid to go see a therapist(I cant even make eye contact with another person) and I don't want to reach out to anyone. I don't think they would take it seriously/wouldnt understandI really dont know what I'm going to do. It's hell in my head, and I want out. In all seriousness, thinking about death is the only thing that brings me peace right now. This is the only place I felt comfortable talking about this. I'm sorry if I went off too much, but I needed to get it out.  All the best to all of you, and if you actually read this.. you da bomb"
You'll never know,"When waking up everyday to ""be that better person"" keeps draining your inner motivation to do anything in this pointless world, look to any other human beside you and realize they may feel the exact same way. I've had suicidal thoughts for years, it's been bad these past couple months. Although it never looked less appealing to me as to when my buddy purposely crashed his car on the highway in efforts to kill himself. Hours before I found out about the incident I had been under the assumption that this ""lady killer"" of a handsome man had been happy all along and living life to the fullest; which I had been jealous of for some time. We all have the inner dialogue, but if you make the effort to keep pushing on one more day, then you're still playing the game. Maybe the levels get easier as time moves on. Best of luck to you; live life until you feel alive. Do not lose yourself on this journey. "
"I'm 31, have no idea what to do with my life, some serious debt and no passion. I. Want. Out.","I just haven't figured out a way yet. Also, it would leave my girlfriend totally crushed. We love each other. But I feel like my burden's too heavy that love can carry it. :(You know what's really ironic? I just spent six weeks in a clinic. Came out and felt more depressed than ever, up to the point where I am now. This is probably the most suicidal I have ever felt. Ugh."
How to kill myself quickly? I'm 16,"I'm 16 and suffer from severe social anxiety. Can't talk to people and can't get a job because of severe (I mean severe) social anxiety. There are no solitary jobs for people my age. Everyone else has no problem getting a job. Can't go to a psychiatrist. My grades are plummeting because I can't think straight or critically anymore and always depressed. Planning on killing myself tonight. I can't pursue my passion because I can't get a job to fund my passion. The only reason I'm still alive is because of this girl at school, and she doesn't know I'm suicidal."
Just want someone to care,"Before school started, I was really confident and knew what I was doing. Now, a month later, I am seriously considering killing myself. The only thing really stopping me is fear and my family at this point. I feel like I'm not useful for anything, I barely have a place among my friends and only get invited to places because I don't talk much, mostly listen. I'm not attractive, my grades are starting to slip, not very good at a lot of things either. Not sure where all my confidence went, but I just want this to be over, suicide or getting over it. I think it might've started at the realization that no one actually cares a lot for me. Sure, my parents care, but it feels like they don't understand and would just try to force religion down my throat. Anyway, I've never had a best friend, girlfriend, or anyone who actually asks how I'm doing. Starting to think the world easily forget me.Sorry if it got off topic, this has been building up for awhile"
''72 Hour Holds'' Are Bullshit,"Do they think they are helping by forcing you into a hospital? Do they think they are helping by threatening you? Do they think they are helpful when they are lying to you? When you get 5 different stories from 5 different people on what is about to happen to you? If that ever happens again the cops will have to shoot me dead to get me in that ambulance. Won't be easy because I'm white, but if I threaten them with a big knife that should do it. Fuck 72 hour holds. I've never known anyone that this helped, and a lot of people, myself included, that it harmed. "
I don't know what to do..,"I just feel so helpless.
My problems ain't such as no money, unemployed, having a disability.. It's just my family and surroundings. I'm under 18 and even tho my monthly income would be enough to live alone, I can't since I'm under 18. My parents are treating me horrible and give me the feeling to kill myself every day and I'm really close to it. Everyday I'm in work I just love to stay there since I know I don't need to see my parents there.
Sadly my father works at the same company so he visits me sometimes and just make me feel worse in front my work mates.
I'm not sure if he doesn't know how bad of a father he is, but he just doesn't seem to know. He things he's doing the best even tho he just makes me want to kill myself.
Added to that my parents are extremly intolerant to ""unnormal"" things like not being born in the same country we live in(even tho they're not themselve..), different sexual orientation and so on.
Being a Bisexual Guy doesn't benefits any of that.
Everytime I'm outside with my parents and they see someone who doesn't behave like a ""normal"" guy or girl, they just talk hours about ill they are and weird, making me feel even worse.
My internet access is capped as well, I have none at phone and none at My computer.
I'm not allowed to go outside of the city and if I leave the house in my spare time, they always question it and want to know exactly where I am and why, or don't allow me go at all.
I just want my own life, my own decisions, and If I don't manage to live alone and end up killing myself I will at least know it's my fault and I fucked up."
I don't know where else to go. I don't know anything anymore other than cops are going to kill me. They tased and beat me in a restaurant about two months ago and I may be losing my mind.,"I'm just the asshole that no one gives a shit about. The Truth of the matter is that they saw me and had already made the decision to fuck with me and I wasn't going to let them. I can and have proven everything in their statements to be false, I can and have proven that everything they say in their reports is a lie and They proved to me that they have not a single fuck to give about ethics because I can't do anything to stop them due to being poor. They'll kill me, they really will and nobody wants to believe that. They came to my house to do a welfare check on the man they tased and beat in a restaurant. He got what he wanted. I've lost the last friend that I had because the right thing to do was to leave her out of it, partly because I love her, Partly because I couldn't trust her knowing she knew more than she told me but, mostly because it was her family that did this to me. I lost any hope of freedom because even on the mistominor charge that they'll stick on me they have that much more time to make up an excuse to confront me. They'll confront me again and put me up against a corner again and the reasonable escalation of force from a taser is a gun. I'll never stop fighting it though because I believe wholeheartedly that it's better to die on the high road and be buried on a mountainside then be found dead in the gutter. I've played a lot of cards in my life and I know when the deck is stacked against me and I know the dealer never loses. I can't see a cop anymore without having an anxiety attack, I don't sleep much and I can barely eat. My own family faults me for all of it. My sister prefers to talk about me then to me. My mother yells at me for not having my shit together and being an asshole all of the time.
I wanted to live a life wherein if I wasn't doing the best I could I was doing the thing that was best I could do for me. I've given up on myself I know most of you think I'm some vile and repugnant piece of shit just smart enough to get myself in trouble.
I don't think it matters anymore what happens to me. I don't think anyone should care about me either. I've fallen in love a handful of times in my life and the reward is only daggers in my back and ghosts haunting me with disapproving looks on their faces.
I very highly doubt anyone will read this, I very highly doubt it matters at this point. Maybe my ranting is just a cry for attention, maybe I'm just putting an epitaph here so one day when I'm gone someone will understand.
I've never been afraid of a fight in my life in any way as long as I knew in my heart that I was on the right side, never paying any mind to which side would in all likelihood win. Most people would call it a fool's gambit but, how would I ever ascribe any meaning to my life... to my death knowing that I wasn't setting out to change the wrong in mine or anyone else's life. I would do anything I could to help anyone who comes to me, regardless of whether they ask because I would never ask for anything from anyone.
Standing in my way has never been a smart place to be and the people behind me aren't safe. I'd say I'd give anything to change that but, in truth, I wouldn't. I wouldn't give up pride or honor for an easier life, I couldn't live with the only two virtues I have to make it a better life for myself knowing that it'll end up hurting someone else, I couldn't live as the animal I'd become not having that system of checks and balances keeping me from my demons.
So here I sit. in pain, defeated and ruined seeing that the ""Good guys"" and the ones after me the most. Feeling like they're watching me now and feeling like I've lost my mind and rationality. Fuck them... fuck me and fuck anyone on either side of my life because I've been fighting monsters long enough to become one and I suppose I'm just toxic now. poison to the ones I love and hate alike.
Don't be me is the best advice I can give. I can only tell you how not to fuck up from a place of hypocrisy and self-contempt. Everything I've said is from the heart and if you've read this far know that I love you. I love you all for being you and not me. I love everyone that has ever been on my side or been in my way thinking that'd I could listen to reason that wasn't from my own heart. I probably don't even know you that well, I probably fucked up your life in some way and I know that love isn't enough to fix a fucking thing.
Whichever one of them pulls the trigger is doing a bigger mercy for me than they'll ever know which is why I know I won't do it myself."
Feeling worthless as another birthday is coming up.,"I'll first start off by saying that I do have thoughts of suicide but not thoughts of going through it, just ways of starting. With that said, I'm not in a state of mind where I'd follow through with any of the thoughts. I'd understand if this post isn't allowed for that reason. I am feeling worthless however, I'll be 25 in a few days with absolutely nothing to show for it. I've went to college for a year, trucking school for about 6-7 months, have had 2 jobs with 1 being for about 3 weeks and the other being 2 days. Bottom line is I quit everything and now it's left me trapped turning 25 with barely any experience or anything. I also have a school loan from trucking school for 3 grand. That isn't very much compared to other school loans but it sure is when you aren't making anything. The problem is that I have a mild stutter which makes interviews really difficult to get through, especially if I get nervous. For that reason I didn't even apply for a job for about 6 months due to just giving up. A few months back I said fuck all of that and started applying to places. Got a few interviews but nothing turned out. Then I got a job from a temp agency which was the job I quit in two days so now I'm right back where I started! It's just a horrible feeling watching other people from your class in high school starting to graduate college, starting to advance in their careers and such while I have absolutely nothing. I really want to be a meteorologist as I've always been obsessed with that sort of thing but I need a job to be able to pay for gas and such to even go to school. The location I'm in is really crappy for job opportunities as the closest decent sized town is 20-30 minutes away so it's not like I'm in a city with tons of job openings or anything. I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for but I feel like getting everything off my chest is a great start."
Help please,I joined today as am not coping and time is running out for me. Don't know what to do. The thoughts are so strong. I don't to die.
Living 18 years is enough right?,"I mean, 18 years sounds like a lot. 18 years of anything sounds like too much. 18 years of swimming, studying, eating, all sound too much. 18 years of life is way too much"
Feeling Like Calling It Quits...,"Hey everybody! New to Reddit here and I'm not sure if this is the place to vent but I just need to get this out there. I've been on this Earth for 19 years and I still don't know what ""Love"" is. I've never felt like I belonged to something, someone, or somewhere. And I'm not talking about having a gf. I don't share a mutual feeling of love, appreciation, acceptance, or value with anyone. I love other people like my friends - janette, danny, David. And my family - my mom, my dad, Alex, beto, Jose. But I don't feel very loved or appreciated. Like it's been so long since I've been genuinely happy... I think i forgot how it felt. I was recently diagnosed with High Functioning Autism too and I just feel so angry about it, why did it take so long to answer the question of ""what's wrong with me"". My relationship with my family is frigid at best. My dad is almost never around (job) - my mom is always angry at me and I don't know why. Is she just angry at my being? My personality? How I look? Why is she so angry at me? - Alex and beto are busy so I don't talk to them a lot - Jose hardly likes me bc I'm annoying. I don't like being home. This place seems so hostile. So unnatural, this house doesn't seem like a home. I feel nervous to leave my room. I'm afraid of getting in trouble... I'll wait until everyone leaves than I'll leave my room. My friends are a lot of fun to be around. It's the only time that I get to smile and relax.  Laugh, even. I'd do anything for them since they make me feel a little good but sometimes they make me feel very bad too - janette especially. I think I hold janette the most dear. I think I actually like her, romantically. She has CP which makes it sometimes painful to walk for her. Whenever she is hurt, I feel very sad and bad. So I try my best not to cause her any discomfort or let her feel bad. This is hard bc I mess up a lot and misread things. She gets annoyed, angry, and distant sometimes and then I feel like I should've have done what I did or even hung out with her bc if I wasn't there, she wouldn't have felt that way. I mean for her feel good bc I love seeing her beautiful smile - her amazing laugh - her pretty hair - her glazing eyes - her endearing voice - her petite cute stature. I  dont think she likes me that way. It's okay I guess. I dont feel like i deserve her. She deserves to be with someone she loves. We still have a good time together. Maybe after I become a US Marine - she'll come around. This is the only thing that keeps me going. This hope of becoming a Marine and feeling a belonging ~ in the USMC. I'm already enlisted, I just need to wait until my boot camp ship date. This is the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet. I told myself I wouldn't hurt myself until then. I only need to survive until then. My autism torments me as well. I can't tell people how I feel, I can write about it though but the speaking words don't work. I cannot feel love but I can feel anger and sadness so clearly. Why? I hate breaking down. Feels bad. I feels so useless and pathetic. No talents, no unique personality traits, no one to love, I'm alone. I'm surrounded by negativity so much and not enough positivity.  I feel so hollow, empty. Like you could open my chest and it will be empty. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of being so tired. I depress myself just so I have something to feel. I know it's bad but I want to feel human. I don't care if I feel awful... It's better than not feeling anything at all. I'm just tired of it. I need a break from it. I want to kill myself but I want t be a Marine too. I said I'll kill myself after the Marine Corps. Maybe my life will be better. Do or die, right? Hahah! Feel free to say anything! Advice, statments, thoughts, feelings. Anything. "
"Suicide is not the only option, but it's the best option. I think today's the day.","They say that there are no magic bullets, but I can think of one. A real bullet. All my problems, instantly solved. I never have to deal with anymore bullshit. It all just sounds so easy. I have my method all worked out, and I've tried it before. Last time my method broke, but I got something stronger this time. If you're wondering why, it's for a few reasons. I'm tired all the time, and either sleep for 2 hours or 12, never a normal amount. I am currently suspend for bad grades in my shitty college, and my bad grades are stopping me from transferring somewhere else, even if I had the energy to go back. I've spent the last 3 years of my life trying to get better, including getting on medication and seeing therapists, and they've all done jack shit. I don't have the patience for one more useless pill, pointless hospital stay, or fruitless therapy session. I've got no girlfriend which is honestly for the best since all I'd do is drag her down. My friends all left for different schools and I didn't make any permanent friends when I joined clubs. I have no one but my dad, and I can't talk to him about this. I have no energy, and can barely leave my bed most days.So, here you go guys. One last chance for the magic bullet words that make my life worth living before I end the charade I once called a life. "
I feel lost,Over the couple of days I have been feeling really depressed I feel like nobody loves me school is bad and I feel like everything gonna go even worse in the future I don't feel anger anymore just pain and sadness should I just end it? Maybe you can help me
I hate living with my brain,"I can't handel it if nothing changes. I moved away and started a new school where I'm supposed to live and make new friends. But it's same old shit. Same mental problems. I just can't get over the voices that are constantly filling my head with doubts. Making be overthink thing's and making me say stupid shit. I have allways been the weird kid. I've just gotten better at masking it. I feel like a fuck up. A screw up. I lose my temper over the stupidest shit. I get annoyed at small noices and I judge allmost everyone in my head because of my own shallow fucking mind sett. So many times I've tried to fix this shit. Woken up with hope, but it's all so poinless. A small victory means shit. It will allways end up the same fucking place. I have never gotten close to taking my own life, but I have thought about it before. I just want it to stop. Just for a while.There is so much pressure to be social. I just can't handel it. I'm not good at making friends. Why do I have to be so shit at everything as well. How the fuck am I suppose to have any confidence. I have this fucking urge to have everyone like me. It fucks with me so bad. I just hate it. The worst it that I should have a good life. I just can't fucking do it. Everything needs to be perfect. Fuck me, fuck me. I just want to be at peache. I constantly feel like I need to be popular. Why? Idk. I just feel so hopeless. That's all. It's the same shit on repeat. I thought I would be more at peache when I was older, but I'm not. I might end it I just don't know."
I would do anything to end my life. Maybe.,"I've been having a really hard time. I am depressed every day. I constantly have this urge to harm myself or kill myself. Now it's to the point where I'm forming visualizations or ideas in my head on how to go about it. My last suicide attempt was in March. I tied a bag around my head. I've seen so many therapists. None of them really helpful except for my current one, who is telling and helping get a better lifestyle. I don't see the point in continuing with her because this doesn't feel like it's helping me and it's really hard for me to open up to anyone in general. Also, I just really really want to kill myself. There is no point for me to continue. I have no joy or pleasure in anything. Every day is the same. I sit at home, not pitying myself but thinking of ways to kill myself. I just don't want to live anymore. I don't matter and never have mattered to anyone. The flashbacks don't stop. This is what I want. I want to die.EDIT: I am thinking about just giving up on everything. My job, my games, everything. I don't want to keep feeling like an oxygen thief every day. I just want this all to end. I keep eating junk food in hopes that a heart attack might happen soon. "
My family likes to tell me no one wants me around and tell me to shut up when I'm so depressed I'm sobbing for hours. I really feel like I'm just a burden and no one wants me around. I have no one to talk to.,That sounds like a hard situation :( I am here if you want to talk about it.
"Hi, I'm writing this for advice anyone might have for me",".I've been depressed probably from the ages of 12+ I'm now 27 and have just come out of a 2 and half year relationship. Luckily I've opened up to friends around me regarding my mental health and they've been determined to make sure I seek help which I have done. I'm seeing a �70 an hour psychiatrist and have been taking citalopram for the past month. Just to get a few things straight when I was in my teens I didn't really understand the term ""depression"" or that it was something I'd consider myself being. I just felt how generally low but I thought that was puberty and this is how most people feel. Since coming out of this relationship i feel like it's brought back my old self and I can now see it as it was before(depression). The medication I've been taking isn't working. I've been given beta blockers (propranolol) which I've been advised will help. I just feel like since I've been on this medication it's made me feel worse, my mum is a pharmacist and has told me that citalopram can be known to take months to start working. I don't feel like I've got months left in me before I start making irrational decisions. I've been self medicating etizolam as a means to stop negative thoughts and on multiple occasions considered taking all of them. I'm not really too sure what I'm expecting as a reply to this post I guess I just don't really know where else to turn to at this point in time and I feel like opening up to anonymous strangers on the internet is a lot easier.  "
Literally Don't See Point of Living,"I have endometriosis and I'm 19. Most days are spent taking pain pills from my parents and curled up in bed. I drag my ass to class and try to do good in my major. Until I have a hysterectomy (which no doctor will perform until I'm at least like 23), this is my life. It's miserable and painful and I'd honestly rather opt out. I've never been particularly positive or motivated, but right now I see no point in continuing to exist here. If I stay, I'll be miserable and unhappy until I have a hysterectomy. I'll put myself in debt until I graduate and then work a meaningless job for decades and finally my body will give out and l'll just die. Even my parents acknowledge that I've been screwed from the beginning with their genetics. I honestly wish they never had me. If I die, I won't have to deal with any more pain or depression or shots or surgeries. Sounds like the better deal."
I'm not strong enough to live,When I was younger I was much more fit to live but last few years changed me and I have become very weak and sensitive to everything.Everything has become impossibile and 10x more harder.I have no motivation to even be emotionaly strong again.At this point death is my only future.I have my method ready.
"I sort of just.. want to become one with the earth, with the universe. Humans are miserable.","I understand this entirely.I live in a metro area with huge socioeconomic inequality.  It is affecting me mentally (pervasive sense of alienation, bouts of severe depression, etc.)I read this board probably like many because it makes me feel less ashamed/alone for struggling so hard to feel hopeful.You guys, this country is in crisis in many ways.  We have a culture where so many are struggling financially due to chronic underemployment and low wages, chronic stress/depression/anxiety, high rents and living costs, and a culture that puts a huge premium on the superficial (ego, status, materialism).Half-white, I grew up around white social conservatives who reviled the government and stigmatized depression (""you just snap out of it"" mentality) and who saw chronic struggle as a sign of weakness.  It's obvious that this country is full of people who are ignorant & negligent about the pain & suffering of those around them; it's self-serving and just awful to witness.I am trying to study/understand Buddhism for survival and just about everything I read makes me realize how this country's culture pushes the inverse of the consciousness that underlies Buddhism -- ""our"" culture emphasizes ego, status & materialism.I just don't want to live in N. America for a while; bc I live very near DC I'm trying to learn about how to prepare for a stint in the Peace Corps, etc."
"I just can't do it anymore. It hurts so much, I hate myself so much.","I just want to die. So badly. I'm pathetic. I'm fat and ugly and covered in scars and just all around an awful example of a human being. I don't have any friends in real life anymore, since I left school they've barely talked to me. I frustrate and anger my parents more and more lately. They used to yell at me occasionally but now it's pretty much every day. My brother used to look up to me, but now I'm just a disappointment. I haven't done schoolwork in so long, my entire 11th grade year was just me rotting in my room. I used to be smart too, straight As in a top school, but now I can barely do anything. Fuck. I've done so many horrible things to the people around me. I'm a disgusting excuse for a human being. There's no point at all. I don't want to live anymore. I hate everything about myself and my life. I wish I could start over as someone completely different. It hurts to be alive. Physically and mentally and emotionally. I'm on meds. I have been for over a year. My therapist quit in June, and I won't have a new one til October. I don't even know why I'm posting here. If any of you actually knew me, you'd agree about how much of a waste of space I am. I just. Can't. Not anymore. I hate myself so much. I always have. I remember hating myself at age 7, because I was too fat. One of my earliest memories is being called piggy by my cousin. God, just, what do I do? All 17 years of my life have been full of mental illness and me being a burden on the people around me. If it weren't for my parents being crushed, I would have killed myself a long time ago. But they're angry at me all the time now, I know it would be better if I had never existed. I wish I was dead. Everything hurts. "
Drunk thoughts,"Oi. It's just some drunken fuck. It's someone who has a family that loves him and would do anything to help him, trustworthy, loyal and sincere frends (and a good bunch of them) but still, he wants to fucking die. He hates this, because he should be happy and grateful for what he has, he has the potential to be whatever he wants, he is not stupid.
But he finds no happiness, no interests, no motivation, everything is dull and grey for him. He cannot feel loved nor love. Everything is an illusion for him. And he is so fucking idiot cause he gets drunk only to make his thoughts flow, to make them fluid and to lose control of his mind for a bit. He also writes in third person this time. Oh, the strange effects of alcohol. Fuck life. Fuck all. I don't fucking care about anything I just want to end myself. Today I discovered that you can die eating hemlock's root. Looks doable and effective enough. They say a bite is enough but I'll fucking eat a salad of that. Also, they say a successful attempt to  suicide only comes after several failures. That won't be my case. Everyone will be shocked and I will laugh in paradise. Because I deserve paradise, since I'm living hell on this earth. This place is terrible. I want to wake up.
I can't feel love. I can't cry."
Will kill myself if nothing changes soon,"Same as before still struggling to find work. Im currently doing things to give myself the best possible chance to get into work (ie. Fitness eating right doing work experience in a sector to hopefully get into something) but nothing is happing im fed up and set a death date if nothing changes soon which i wont confirm. If not, hpefully natural causes takes me out before my life is currently in the balance "
I wish I could just stop breathing,"I don't think I can do it anymore. Everything's pointless, I dropped out of uni and I just see all my friends around me graduating and looking to the future. I'm stuck in a boring job on low pay & I feel as though I'll just be stuck like that. I've messed up every good opportunity I've ever had. I'm so skint I can't afford to do anything- all my money goes on my car, rent, food and bills. I'm permanently in my overdraft. I just feel so lonely and cut off from everyone, but I don't even want to talk to my friends because my life is so shit it's almost embarrassing.
I can't even pretend to be happy so it's easier to not see anyone. I've been suicidal before and tried before but I think I've had enough now.
I live with my boyfriend and he doesn't care about me anymore. He wants me to leave, to move back in with my parents but I know they don't really want me there and he doesn't want me here so nobody really wants me anywhere. I'm so sick of being sad and alone and bored and jealous of everyone around me.
I can't do it anymore. I just wish I could stop breathing."
Confessed to my Boyfriend,"Came home from school feeling ready today. Things just aren't going well and I was feeling like I have no future. I actually still feel that way. I'm not feeling suicidal at the moment, but I ended up confessing to my boyfriend that I had the urge earlier and he just made me feel worse. Saying he'd kill himself too and how he'd do it and how it would affect those around me and how selfish I was being. I'm not sure what I'm expecting from posting this, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Instead of thinking, ""Wow, I am so loved"", I just feel angry and more alienated than I already did."
Life is kicking my ass,"I'll try to summarize where my life is at right now. In about 3 months time, I've fucked everything up and I'm at a place right now where for the first time in my life, I can't find anything to keep me afloat. First of all, I'm 29. In May this year, I lost my job, and I didn't find a new job immediately. I had some trips and festivals planned this summer, and since I got fired I had some security with an unemployment income. In June, I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. This had been planned for a while. It cost me some money of course, and the apartment was a bit more expensive than the previous one. Over the summer, a long string of bad decisions lead to serious financial trouble. I started abusing my credit card, spending money I didn't have. Right now, my balance is at -3500 EU, and my bank called me up to announce that I have to clear this debt by September 15th. I cancelled an upcoming vacation, and furiously started looking for a job. It's been harder than I expected, and right now I don't have the time to get that money, so my breathing space is decreasing one day at a time. I've been trying to keep it together and build things up again constructively, but I've been suffering. I'd been investing a lot of time in this girl I met, and there was a real prospect of a relationship. Once I didn't decide to go on the vacation, she kind of kicked me when I was down and made things worse by throwing all kinds of insults and blames at me. Obviously, this is not the kind of person I need in my life so I broke this off instantly. Yesterday, my roommate announced after only 3 months that he doesn't want to live with me anymore because of this insecurity, which I don't blame him for. For the last month now I've been trying to stay positive. I stopped using drugs, stopped smoking, stopped smoking weed, recovered my rhythm, started working out again, dealt with all the shit that had been piling up for months, and I've been looking for a job intensively. Today though, I couldn't keep it together anymore. I'm usually a pretty positive person, and I've always enjoyed some uncertainty in my life as I was always able to see new opportunities in everything. For the first time now, I don't have any security and I can't seem to find anything that gives me the energy to continue. I know all of this has been my own fault, as I've been running away from my problems way too long. A lot of people whom I considered friends (the girl and the roommate to start with, but all the other friends I planned on going on the vacation with too) have been dropping me like I have some infectious disease. There is not a single aspect of my life that isn't shitty right now. My financial situation is dramatic, I'm out of options and time is running out. I don't know where I'm gonna live in a few months, or how I'm even gonna pay for it. The prospect of a relationship has all of a sudden disappeared, a lot of my ""friends"" are gone, the job hunt is giving me one disappointment after the other... And right now I just can't see a way out. My life is in the gutter, and any prospect I had is now gone. For a few weeks now, I've been fighting thoughts of suicide. But every time I worry about my situation, I end up with only one possible solution. Every time I come to that solution, it's becoming harder and harder to fight that thought. Today I broke down completely and just started crying my heart out, I even started writing a goodbye letter... It's not the first time I've had thoughts about suicide, the circumstances in my life right now have made those thoughts stronger than ever. My biggest problem is that I could never stand the pressure of the expectations that were put on me. I kind of 'ran away' from home years ago to get away from the pressure, but I've realized that my entire life has been an illusion. My true self has been completely overshadowed by this image of myself I projected onto the world, through which I pretended to be able to fulfill those expectations.As a result, I've always struggled with a heavy identity crisis. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, but the problem is that I don't know who I really am. I've been looking deep inside, only to find emptiness... I feel like my true self has died years ago, and I'm a ghost that's merely physically present in this body. I could always cope somewhat with this issue by looking for external distractions, by escaping reality. Through the circumstances of my life at the moment, reality has come crashing in, and I no longer have the energy to pretend. I'm down to my most humble self. I've lost all my will to fight, I'm down on my knees. I just need a fucking break already, but the bad news just keeps piling up. My back is against the wall, and I'm not sure how I'm gonna get out of this. I have a few true friends left who I can talk to about this, but I doubt they realize how bad I'm doing... I guess I just needed some place to vent and be honest about how bad my situation is right now."
Im gonna do it soon..,"See growing up i had an abusive and alcoholic dad, he woild beat the shit out of me, and cracmes my skull when i was 8, even though my mom then got full custody he still found ways to abuse me and my siblings, ans he destroyed my moms self esteem and left her in horrible debt too.(i am the baby of 4 kids). Evee since then ive been diagnosed with Chronic Depression, Extreme levels of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and add. After we finally stopped having to see my dad at age 13 my sister lets call her Anne, got a new boyfriend, his name was ashton, he would beat the shit out of her so badly and if i calles the cops or did anything he would beat the shit out of me too, he ended up knocking up my sister with my wonderful niece who is 1 year old. and then finally 6 months into my niece being born we finally got Ashton to leave, even rhough he will still come to our house and break shit, and mess it all up. fast foward to 14 years old. My friends took me out to the lake, i thought to have a girls night, but they ended up pulling knives on me and saying if i dont drink they were gonna stab me. so about 9 drinks in im already fucked, and i get pulled bejind a bush by a guy.. and he fucking sexual assaults me. ive never told anyone about that until this year. Fast foward through all of my cutting and anger and sadness to now, ive been dating my boyfriend for 9 months 1 month ago he left for college 2 hours away and no biggie because i love him and its great. well i went to see him for the first time and he did ntohing but treat me like i didnt exist, and i had brought him all of his stuff from home too, i was tryong be a good girlfriend because jes a great guy and then when we got alone time in his dorm he got really nice and sweet, the guy i fell in love with. we then had sex.. and then after he went back to treating me like im worthless.. For about the past 2 months ive been so suicidal. and so numb and broken. and i really domt feel like i can be alive. it hurts to breathe to think. i fucking hate myself, because i can put all my problems aside and help other people but i never get anu help in return, and im so just done. i fucking hate myself. and i dont wanna be alive anymore. i dont."
About ready to die soon,"As of Wednesday last week I made myself homeless and upped and left my job. As a result I moved back up north and am currently living with my grandparents, they are unwell and earlier last night I texted my dad saying that I'm going to declare homelessness and I just had to include in the text that my grandparents wouldn't stop bickering and badmouthing me as if I'm deaf. I can't believe I texted him that now as he went on the offensive and started bombarding my granny with hateful texts. It's currently 5am and the landline has been ringing on and off for the past hour. Nobody is answering but I know it's my dad. I fucked up by texting him that, it's not fair on my grandparents and they are letting me stay, I had a lapse in judgement telling my dad that.I never thought it would escalate to this I just hope it passes after tonight, I assume my dad is drunk right now. I sound like a brat yet I'm a grown man... Im 27 years old, I regret what happened since Wednesday last week, I wish I could just die. My grandparents don't need this I messed up so bad.I need a way out I only cause destruction in my path, everyone gets hurt in some way if I'm involved."
"I want to call, but fear my career","Hi, my  depression is really beating down on me today and I want to pick up the phone and call the hotline but I don't want to lose my job. My job as a security officer requires me to carry a loaded gun on a daily basis and I don't want to be disqualified for calling. I have 12+ hour day today and need the help. Is there a suicide text service?"
I was so lonely I ate my own shit as a kid,"First day of Junior year in college, and I'm sitting in my dorm alone. I guess I should be used to this. I have friends, but they all think I'm dumb. They know I have issues, but they think they're so innocent. They think my insecurities are about my appearance or height or difficulty talking to girls or some other normie shit. And of course, if I want them to be my friends I can't straight up tell them what's really on my mind. I have to pretend to have other issues. I have a couple friends that I pretend I'm secretly gay to, another few that think I'm trans, some that think I'm just anxious, because whenever they think they figured me out I run with it because I'm terrified of anyone actually where I truly come from. I have dumb friends that think I'm just dumber than them, and I have smart friends that think I'm too smart for my own good. I hate that the only way I can stay sane and socialize is to pretend to be all of these stupid fucking normies. And they give me all this stupid advice that I could have just gotten looking at quotes on instagram, none of which, btw, have anything to do with accepting yourself when you literally gave up and ate shit at age 12. The ones that think I don't think about things are the hardest. I'm in this mess because I thought about things too much, and I still do. Nobody has ever written a song about being so lonely and depraved as a fucking middle schooler that ate their own shit. My friends think I don't really care about music because I don't bother to listen. I listen, I just haven't heard a song that sings anything relevant. Even inspirational people.  Well nobody remotely remarkable's rock bottom seems to be even close to a 12 year old manufacturing their own intimacy by eating shit. Pro tip: If you can't get normal sex, just warp your budding sexuality into something that you can get! Then when it solidifies and becomes part of you, you will never have to worry about getting off again! Hate yourself for it and regret it? Even bigger turn on since you can get off to that feeling!I keep running away from people, and as I get older it's getting harder and harder to start over. I transferred colleges before last year, and honestly as much as I feel like I want to preserve my relationships and make new friends, I feel so guilty that I have to lie to them and trick them into thinking I'm not a disgusting subhuman being. They don't get why I act the way I do. The only talent I have is writing code. I fucking hate that I'm so good at it that everyone assumes I must be fine. Like, a kid who can shit out so much fucking code isn't a red flag for someone desperately trying to figure something out? But everyone just keeps praising me and giving me money and I feel like I don't deserve a reward for being the most fucked up 20 year old. Toys will keep me entertained for a while, and with plenty of money and very few friends thankfully I can afford them. But I don't see the point in living if the monster that is the real me has to stay locked away. I just leave a path of confused, possibly hurt people. The world doesn't need that. "
Sick of the System,"Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old asian-american guy in the U.S suffering from major depression, social anxiety, ADHD. The suicidal thoughts I'm getting are more intense then over. They first started when I was a teenager but have only grown stronger now that I'm in college mainly due to stress, inability to cope with real world, and having no real ""best"" friends/gfs. Most of my life I barely had any friends. I've always felt I've talked to more online people in my gaming communities then those in real life. I also have asian parents and all they can tell me is take some pills and stay in school and study so i've never had anyone to talk to with my issues. I'm near the end with almost no motivation for living anymore. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because of music, video games, anime, and tv shows."
I have decided today is the day I am going to kill myself. I haven't decided which method I want to use yet but I will have one picked by the end of the day today.,"Hey there bud, sorry if your going through a rough time, I myself have been going through a couple of few months. To start I lost my little sister, she was 25 and apparently she was a drug addict which no one foresaw. I am left with her 4 year old son to raise as my own as I raised her( I'm only 28). At first I couldn't live with myself but as time went on, I realized I'm still here for a reason that reason being him. There is a lot to live for and you'll figure yours out when it comes. Before I would contemplate everyday in which way I would go out like you, now I'm 6 months without one single thought through my mind. I do not know you nor do I know anything about you but I can assure you that what ever you are going through it will pass my friend. And one day you will look back and be thankful you didn't do it because like me I gained a son and now I have all to live for, and one day you'll have yours just give it time to find your calling. Best wishes my friend god bless"
I used to work w/ celebs but they all moved across the country and now no one gives a shit about me. Now I'll never be famous. I want to die.,how'd you get a chance to work with celebs? that sounds like a cool experience. why did they all move?
I feel nothing,"after 14 years of thinking I would be alone, I found the one girl that I truly loved. And she left me because she had fallen for one of my friends, who didn't even have any interest in her. And as much as I want her to be happy, and as much as I want to support her, I feel nothing. I don't even feel sad. I should be upset, or mad or even depressed but I don't feel anything. it's just numb. I can't even laugh at anything. I have to put on a fucking show every day and act like I'm ok just so people don't suspect anything but really I just don't care about anything. I just want to fucking choke myself with an extension lead. I've tried several times but my instincts kick in and just as I'm about to go out my hands force the cord loose around my neck. I just want this hell to end. I wouldn't wish this emptiness on anyone. Not even the people I used to hate with a passion. I just can't stand it."
Too scared to end my life... :(,"I really want to end my life for many reasons. I hate being depressed everyday i wake up, i have no future, i hate the way my life is atm, i have no parents, i have hardly any friends. And i dont want to do anything with my life and i want to end it really badly but i'm to scared to do it and i'm also scared of hurting my family and friends. So im forced to exist in a life that i want to end. I dont know what to do."
Why is my life so shit?,"So to get started, Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm a 20 year old trans-girl, I came out to a couple friends years ago, some a couple months ago. Just a few things to summarize me.However there is this sociopath in my life who I suspect fond out, the fucked up thing is, he goes as far as to file a police report making out I'M A FUCKING TERRORIST, mind you I almost committed suicide when detectives rocked up asking me about random shit I know nothing about, thankfully there not back. Who wouldn't when you're getting threatened with 40 years and the detectives are coming off like I did shit to get information out of me (good cop, bad cop kind of bullshit)If this guy hates you that much, he'll pick things to ""adopt"" and pretend to have, because he can't manipulate me directly, he manipulates everyone around me. My parents know NOTHING about transgender people, now thanks to this cunt they think there mentally ill, sexual perverts etc all thanks to this guy pretending to be transgender doing fucked up bullshit to attack me.The bastard has ruined all chances of me coming out, I joked around to my parents saying I was having a sex change, there constantly going on about this fuck tard and how I shouldn't copy him etc, and that I can do anything but get a sex change.Personally I kind of just want to grab a knife and slice my fucking neck until I die.To give you a idea of how low this cunt is, when he found out I had depression and selfed harmed in high school (though his mother) mother is best mates with mine etc, every class I was in, he would ""suddenly be depressed, make out he self-ed harmed, than would go on about how badly he was bullied in life etc. Literally copying my sob story, fucking cunt. I already feel no one cares about me, and you're confirming it.When he found out my dad was abusive and had bipolar, whenever he was around me, he would go upto random people abused the fuck out of them and say, oh sorry I have bipolar.Thanks to him, every fucking person around me has a fucked up idea of transgender people, and has made it impossible for me to transition and come out.My birthday is in a few days, and I'm considering killing myself then, every since I was a child I had nothing but bullying, people would always fucking forget my birthday, mother would be nice and say maybe they forgot it is fathers day, bullshit other people I know with a birthday a week after mine, had tons of fucking people rock up.I'm not a person who hates people, but personally if it wasn't illegal, I would beat and kick the living shit out of this sociopathic cunt. every fucking person he hates, he will destroy mentally, I suffer constant panic attacks from him, I had the shit kicked out of me by bullies, HE WOULD MAKE OUT THAT I WAS THE FUCKING BAD GUY, yeah totally I get my fucking finger sliced open, I'm the bad guy for slapping them in self defense, fuck off cunt, went as far as to threaten to break my nose and assault me simply for self defense, AFTER TELLING ME I SHOULD STICK UP TO MYSELF.I just don't know what the fuck to do. I've already had to import the drugs I need to transition and risk harming my health due to this fuckhead.Basically he'll take the role of a transgender person, destroy the image of transgender person, he is literally going around saying he is mentally ill, can't help wearing dresses and being a sexual pervert etc, just to fucking get at me for some fucked up reason that I don't know.He knows that I'm still transitioning and not giving a fuck so he has stopped because it's making him look like a fucking moron.(PPS)99.9% of trans people don't fake being transgender, just like 99.9% of cancer patients don't fake cancer etc.The thing with this guy is if he finds out something about me, the next day he'll suddenly have it go around posing like he has it, than destroy the legitimacy of such thing.He is so bad at lying that there are holes in every little fucking thing he says yet people believe every word that comes out his mind. He did the same thing with my autism he made out that he was autistic for a good week or so while doing and saying stupid shit that makes all of autistic people look bad.He does this with every little thing, found out I was deaf, would make out I was mishearing shit and that I was retarded DESPITE hearing it correctly and confirming it with the news article title that was fucking published.Last and not least, I've been searching for a job that last 2 years, I'm not getting anywhere and I'm in a shit ton of debt that is driving me mental.While I have been diagnosed with ""depression and anxiety"" I'm not on meds because my parents think I don't need them and that ""I'm faking it"", you guessed it due to the fucking sociopath."
I am going to die,"I am unemployed for more than 2 years because of severe depression and anxiety, and I could only manage to attend 5 interviews. I don't have any hope of getting a job in this life. I am in my mid 20s(m) and ashamed of myself because of this. I have  good educational qualification but still I cannot get a job.
Today I went for a job interview and it was a fucking joke. Maybe the HR laughed at me after I left because of my ackward answers. I can't even think clearly and my mind goes blank and I stutter and stutter and stutter... and humiliate myself.
I don't have the courage to commit suicide but I will somehow manage and get rid of myself. I have wasted a lot of my parents and friends money and I don't want to trouble them anymore.
I tried everything; medication for depression, nofap, yoga,  and I am working out for the last one year everyday without fail, but still my mind is not normal.
I got a job interview tomorrow and it's my last try. I will do my best. If am not hired I will kill myself for sure.
Maybe I was born to die like this, without any happiness throughout my life. "
I want to end my life,I'm sorry if I sound like I'm begging for invites but I'm really not.Currently I have no one to talk to who won't judge me. My closest friend always seems to make it out as if I'm in the wrong most of the time and it's a shifty feeling. I feel like I have no one left and I want to end it.
having a mental breakdown rn because i cant even kill myself. im such a fucking pussy. i really should find some help,Please do get some help
18 Years Old and Sick of it. (Long Post),"I honestly just want it to be over. When I think about suicide (which, for me, is a regular occurrence), it somehow makes me feel happy. I think about the ways I would accomplish it, and I'm pretty sure I have a plan for it. But at the same time, I don't want to do the world a favor and off myself because I don't want to hurt my family (I have no friends, nor am I involved in any social groups), as they've done so much for me. Both of my parents are in their early to mid-sixties, and they adopted me and my younger brother (16) after we were born. But I don't feel like I'm worth it. Depression has been my very own Sisyphus' Rock over the past seven years, and just when I begin to brighten up a bit, college comes along and depression hits me like a Mack truck full of bricks. I'm only 5'7.5"", and 265 lbs. I've been trying to lose weight and went from 277 to 254, but gained it back after two weeks of self-hatred and depreciation. I'm repulsive to look at, have no redeeming qualities, and have social skills that would make Forrest Gump seem like a Casanova. I haven't left my house or my college campus for over a month now, and can't find the motivation to talk to people, go to the gym, or take pride in my school work. I The only things I find enjoyment in is playing Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege (but I suck at both of those, another testament to my worthlessness), and reading about and working on cars.I just want to pass away in my sleep.Sorry for wasting your time."
I called a suicide hotline on my way home from work last night,"I made a throwaway account because many family members know my main. Last night at work was a particularly difficult one. Ideation would not leave my head all night and I didn't know what to do. All night I kept thinking of what I should do so I don't have to go through another one of these days. I could drive my car off a bridge. I drive over the same exact one every single night on my way home. It would be so easy. I got off work and into my car and broke down. I called a hotline to stay on the phone with me until I got home. I don't know what to do anymore. It gets better, and then it gets worse than I ever thought possible. I see no future for myself because I just get closer and closer every single time. I'm so lost.Thanks for letting me vent."
"Long story, I need help/advice.","Yesterday, I began a new job working with people on a very close and interpersonal level. The reason that I chose this job was because I have felt I needed to use my degree and if I don't, nothing is worth it. Throughout my college career, I have known I did not want to work with people that closely and I wanted to be research oriented. I come home from my job and something snapped in my head. I have been feeling as if the only way out is either suicide or suicide, nothing looks hopeful. My SO thinks I should try one more day, but I feel like I cannot do it and subconsciously, I've known I can't do something like this all along. I have also needed therapy for months, however, due to things that have been happening in my life since I graduated, I have not found the time to get a therapist (stupid excuse, I know). I feel as if I need to quit, get a part time job I feel comfortable and safe at, and work on seeing a therapist immediately. I am extremely worried about judgment from my SO and/or family (I won't be telling any of them any time soon). Please help me, what do I do? I feel no way out."
Im starting to give up again...,"Every time I think about work I think about killing myself. I been trying to get a job since mid July.
Ive at least put in 20 applications... I have been called multiple times last month but because social anxiety, the only phone call i could return was for a clinical trial. My social anxiety dramatically lightened for some reason. killing myself would be easier. I wouldnt have to make money or stress anymore. i wouldnt have to worry about medical bills at all in the future. i wouldnt have to think about school or how i cant go until i reach my 2 yr goal. Im trying to find something where I stand on my feet less because the pain is excruciating if I don't... but thats hard without a college degree and without decent experience...Im getting a strong want to just choke myself to death now...
We own plenty of things I could use."
Any advice?,"hiIm 16 years old and currently at the stage in life where i need to consider what to study at university. I have no clue what to study. I have thought about dentistry but it seems hard and i cant do it. Thats why i want to commit suicide. I feel i serve no purpose on this planet. I have no motivation to work or study and i dont want a job. i enjoy sitiing on my laptop. please can someone ofeer me any advide? thankssorry for bad englisj, from spain"
"Visiting a new psychiatrist triggered a panic attack with intense suicidal thoughts. Please help, i am really suffering right now.",What kind of help
Back to school,"If I fuck up this semester, I'm going to kill myself. Tried and failed before. Not scared anymore. I've ruined my life and broken down some key friendships. I'm a shit student so I don't plan on passing my courses. It was all going so well until shit hit the fan. I just don't care anymore. "
Does life seem a bit pointless to anyone else? (Rant),"I've felt suicidal for as long as I remember but managed to keep a lid on it the past year since I've been busy with school and personal issues. Yesterday, my only friends (and the people I love the most) have told me they want nothing to do with me. No reason for it, either. The love of my life also confessed to loving me back, only to have my drunken mind reject them so they can explore during university and not have to stay tied down for the greatest days of our lives. This turned bad, and now he wont talk to me much anymore.I've been thinking about suicide all night, wrote a note, relapsed a bit and listened to sad songs. Read an inspiring article on why not to commit suicide, but then started to realise that no matter what I do from here on, everything will be for nothing. I can become the best in my profession and become rich, marry the love of my life, meet my best friends and have a great life. But eventually I'll have to die. We all will. Why should I suffer for the next 60+ years just to have it all mean nothing and all end anyway? Nothing means anything, and one day no one will remember my life and everything that I gave a shit about, everything I slaved over, everything I worked hard for. It will all be gone forever. What's the point anymore? I'm probably not going to kill myself tonight, I'm too afraid of the afterlife to go through the process of hanging myself, and I have no other options right now. This just sucks. I feel pain wash over my entire body every time I press another button on my keyboard because I remember my life is meaningless and I still can't do anything about it. Damn."
I want to stab myself.,I don't want to kill myself. I just feel like I can't continue with all the stress. I have so Much work and responsibility. I want out. I want to stab myself in a non-lethal fashion. I don't know what to do
A method that is the least painful and less chance surviving,"Please only comment if you are helping me with this question because I have already made my mind I am just planning how. If someone cares they wouldn't tell me to live this miserable life. I will truly appreciate and believe that you care about me if you suggest a less painful and quick method.
Even if it is quick and less chance surviving I can take it I guess."
What good is a hotline when you have a chronic illness?,"Yeah, I called one.  Told the guy everything and he told me he couldn't help me.  Of course he was right, I just thought I'd make a stab in the dark.  Suicide prevention has nothing to offer those suffering chronic illnesses.  They can't offer hope for those types.  When you get older, you begin to see that life can be hopeless and that some people have no choice but to bail.  "
Rambling about my obsessive thoughts,"I cried in my car today about how unfair it was that I can't kill myself because it would hurt my family too bad. My brother has learning disabilities, obsessive thoughts, social anxiety, PTSD and psychosis. My dad is likely bipolar and has attempted suicide, and my Mom is just a nice freaking person. I know they care about me but that doesn't make my obsessive suicidal thoughts stop. I honestly just can't imagine how much it would destroy them. That said, this is the furthest I've planned. I'm thinking of who to leave my things with, I'm glad I done have all that much. My head just isn't in the same realm as the living anymore. My obsessive suicidal thoughts aren't even ideation but like a girl inside myself telling me ""kill yourself, die"" every 2 seconds on repeat during every waking hour. A bit of being called ""slut"" ""whore"" ""worthless"" as well. I can't shut her off. The only way I know how to stop the thoughts is to shut myself off. I really don't know if I can take them much longer. "
Need advice,Texted me ex cause I was pissed off she blocked my number and I feel relieved and terrible . Not sure I did the right thing about having the last word . Been heart broken for months and thoughts about suicide during this time period. I wasn't that harsh but not nice either . Made it clear I was hurt and my intentions to do the same back to her . I was tired of being the bigger person and letting my feelings build up inside me . Was unhealthy and I said some things that I can take back . But clearly she played the victim still and made it seem like I'm the bad guy . She broke up with me and the reasons were petty . Just don't know if I did the right thing or not . It's like I hate her and still love her at the same time . I feel like I couldn't gain anything or lose it by telling her off and how I feel. Any options?
I wanna talk about Suicide,Simple enough
"BPD, depressed and pregnant","Hi guys, this is my first time writing here.
Yesterday I found out I was pregnant from a guy I was seeing.
The ""funny thing"" is that he not only pulled out, but I also took plan B the following day. I'm only 2 weeks pregnant and I'm definitely getting an abortion. The thing is, I've been through so much in this life (mother's death, adoption, weird father, economic problems, housing situations), that I don't know if I will be able to emotionally survive.
I just can't understand how some people like me, have such fucked up lives. Can somebody relate to this?Thank you."
Scared of the inevitable,"I thought I had been clean for a month before a few days ago when I made a mistake. I bought a new pack of razor blades after making a point to leave my old ones at home. I was determined to get better. However, instead I've been spending my time the same as always, skirting around excuses for cuts. I really thought I was getting better & recovering, not just from self harm, but from constant suicidal ideation.
I've been just as depressed as ever and I have an unshakable urge to just kill myself already. It won't go away & it's driven me to massive breaking points several times. I'm not sure what to do. I'm afraid of myself but maybe finally getting what I was meant to do will help. "
Suicidal sister in hospital,What is a good step after my sister's release from the hospital? Social services are on observation this first 24 hours. How can we help as a family for the short and long term effects of this problem.
I think it's time for me to go now,"I've reached my breaking point this week and feel so oddly relieved, like I'm finally being able to breathe again knowing that I'll finally get to experience the end. I feel at peace with myself now."
"I'm not worth it, I'm truly not.","I'm not worth the air I breathe. I hate who I am, I hate who I've become, I hate the person I see in the mirror. I've become such an empty lifeless shell. I leech the happiness out of everything. I've ruined my life through apathy and laziness, walked through this depressing worthless life filled with this and that because woe is me. I can't stand myself anymore. I used to think I wanted to get better but I don't think I do anymore. I think I just wanted to finally give up. I've ruined every relationship and friendship I have ever had, even my own mother despises me. She regrets me. I'm jobless, with no transportation besides a bike in 100+ degree weather. Stuck in a home filled with conflict and negativity, but that's my fault. I'm the reason for the conflict, because I've become nothing but a piece of shit. I'm selfish and I can't even do that right. I don't deserve help, I don't want to be a victim because I'm not one. I did this to myself, and I've known this day was coming for a long long time now. I don't want to hurt anyone else but simply by existing I hurt them more. The least I can do is make it end. My birthday is coming up and maybe that's significant. Maybe its time to finally close that door. I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry but the world is truly better without me."
Am I a coward for not killing myself yet?,"As the title says, am i being too much of a coward about this? I have been thinking of committing suicide for 2 months now but I can't seem to do it. I have a mother who I know just wants the best out of me, but the words that she says to me makes me think that she doesn't care about me at all. I have friends, but I can't even determine if they are truly my friends or just a bunch of fakes. I get bullied in school almost every single day. Video games are the only thing that makes the pain go away but I get addicted. My grades have plummetted and I can't even see clearly now. I know that people will just say ""just look at the homeless people, you have it better than them."" But money can't buy happiness. I'm no longer happy. I spend my time at school depressed and when I get home, I have a mother who constantly scolds me for nothing. But, even if they are like that, I still think to myself if my pain right now will carry on to someone else or they would not even care if I disappeared from this world. Would they even care? If I hang myself right now I know that it could cause more pain to them than I'm experiencing right now. Because they will lose their son. So basically the only thing that is keeping me from committing suicide is fear."
I really don't want to live,"Let's start off by saying I'm a teenager. I've had moments of happiness, sadness, everything. Many times I felt suicidal, but today just takes the cake.
Recently I started high school. I had one friend in the class I was in, yet I decided to change the class so I could be with a ""friend"" that I was in class in middle school. Well, I changed the class, and he treats me like dust. Like I don't exist.  I can't believe this. I made my situation from bad to terrible. I had one friend to talk to - now I have literally none. All day in school, alone.
I don't think I'm able to change the class again, because you need a replacement person to take the place.
This really might seem like a minor thing, ""you'll make friends in the new class"", no I won't. It's full of scum and I have 4 years of this, everyday in front of me.
I left the school early because I wanted to cry and I wasn't able to sit there any longer.
I had a mental breakdown today and stood on the train tracks thinking if I should end it. I decided not.
Then I go back to my house, and it appears the teacher called my mom. There, I had an argument with her. I thought that it would get better. But it didn't.
It seems like no one cares about what I feel. I'm completely alone now and this really makes me want to put an end to this. In the end, we all will die, so it's basically like a shortcut.
I don't know. I really don't. It's such a simple thing to fix - just change my class back to the old one. But these pieces of shit teachers don't give a single fuck about it.
Fuck this shit man. "
"Please read, im breaking","Hey, lately i having been down, sad and suicidal. I plan on ending my life in a few days due to my reasons i shall say. 1. My first problem would that im lonely, i want a girlfriend, someone i can hold by my side when im sad. Someone to talk about video games and anime. I feel lonely while ALL my friends are out kissing and fucking random girls im here beating off and sobbing in my bed. I can make girls laugh and be my best friends but they never want to date. girls say im cute. I hate having dreams about a girl and  we dating to wake up and realize the spot on my bed that she should be is cold. :(. 2. Im starting grade 10 in 2 days. All friends and family say imma love it, but i dont known anybody (New school). Its a trend to be a dart boi (Canadian fuck bois, smokes cigarettes but they call them darts) (i smoke occasionally but am a skater) 50%  are nice 50% are dicks. Last year dart bois LOVED me. But i cant be bothered getting in trouble with police for breaking a guys arm in a fight again, lol. 3. I hate how my life is plane boring . 4. I made a post a while ago. "
Without my psychiatrist I want to kill myself,I miss him so much. I developed intense feelings for him over 2 and a half years and he let me go 8 months ago. The only thing that gets me through my school work is living in the delusion that I will see him again in the future if I study hard and get back to the university where he works.I feel pathetic and I actually thought about buying a rope and hanging myself. I'm not sure where I would do it though.
I'm just so sick of existing,If I wasn't scared of hurting people I love I would have killed myself so long ago. Life is shitty and I'm forced to go through it alone.
"Gawd help me. Hurricane, etc.","Hurricane Irma is bearing down on us. Unlike most other people, I have no money to go get hurricane supplies. I'm out of food stamps. I'm unemployed. I have no car. I posted on Facebook for help. Not one fucking relative has offered me help. Only one friend, outside of Facebook, has tried to offer me help me suggestions but is unable to provide tangible help. I have called for the special needs shelter plus transport because I rely on a medical device to stay alive when I sleep, and I've heard nothing from them. I don't want to live through this. I haven't wanted to live for years. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid of being hurt and not dying. I absolutely am in shock at how absolutely freaking alone I am in life. Virtually nobody cares. My best friend said to me yesterday that nobody wants to hear it. And she's right. Nobody cares. I don't want to be in this life anymore where I'm going through fucking hell and not one person, not one relative gives one flying fuck. I've been cutting. But it's not providing the relief and calm that it usually does. Maybe I should just execute my plan before this thing makes landfall."
The Balcony,"I'm working on the 6th (top) floor of the office building. For the past few days, I've used my break to go out on the balcony. You know, for a breath of fresh air. Turns out, it is SO tempting to just dive! The first day I went out there, I was actually shocked, because instinctively I went halfway over the handrail.One of these days I'll actually manage to do it (:"

"Sometimes, when it gets too hard to be happy and positive, I am drowning. And I need a human-shaped lifeboat to hold on close, and cling desperately for warmth and safety.","And that's how I feel today, I guess.I try so much to be a nice, positive person. A good person. Check my post history, if you don't believe me. But today, I'm not strong enough to do that on my own.I need help.I desperately long for someone to hold me and to take me in unconditionally as theirs. I am clingy, insecure, and so horrified of being lost again. I just don't want to be unhappy."
Ballet frustration,"Hi all, I know is silly but I am ballet dancer for quite some years now. I am not bad but not Etoile either.
If anybody is a ballet dancer or know somebody who is, for sure you know what I mean when I said this is really frustrating.
After every rehearsal or class I just what to end it all.
As I said, this is silly but this is something I cannot take out of my head.
Some days I fantasies about putting a rope around my neck and other just hit the walls until my hands bleed.
Sometimes while I dance I enjoy it, but most of the time I get frustrated seeking perfection.
I thought many times of quiting but there is this little voice in my head ""Perhaps if you try this you may archive it"" so I keep on trying. I know this is a very stubborn position but... Thanks for reading, I am not expecting Amy responses. Just needed to said it "
I'm living 95% of my life for the 5% I'm happy.,"So yeah. 95% of the time I'm contemplating suicide. I've been told all my life that it's the most selfish thing one could do, but is ending your life really selfish if continuing to live would be worse? The top reasons I want to commit suicide are as follows:1) School. This is my first year in a public school (I've been homeschooled all my life). Now that I'm in the NCVA, my grades have plummeted, even though I spend a lot more time doing schoolwork. As a homeschooler, most of my test results were in the college level, as a public schooler, I'm below average. It's absolutely taken over my schedule, and it's the number one reason I want to die.2) My Mom. She certainly knows how to make my free time miserable. She treats nobody kindly, not even my Dad. She has no clue how to raise someone with autism (more on that later). So yeah, quite frankly, she's a b*tch.3) My siblings. I know numbers 2 and 3 are stereotypical, but in my opinion, I have the most selfish, self-centered, bratty siblings ever. At least my youngest brother is cute.4) My schedule. Most of the free time I have I have to lie about. My parents don't even know I have a Reddit account, and they would kill me if they found out (at least then I would be happy).5) My disorders. I have autism, and I'm 80% sure I have bipolar too. Autism I actually like, although it does make my social life awkward, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't lose it if I could. Bipolar on the other hand I would gladly lose. And the worst part is, nobody else knows I have it.Sorry if that was a bit weird. I just like to lay things out mechanically. You could say it's an autism superpower. So 95% of my life is hell. The other 5% of my life is when I'm at church (and I don't even consider myself a Christian). When I'm at church, I help out in children's ministry, get to see my friends (the main reason I haven't committed suicide yet, aside from me being a p*ussy, is them), play video games (yeah, my church is awesome), and just have an all around blast. Unfortunately, 5% of my life isn't enough to keep my going. I'm 12, and nearly jumped off a wall on Wensday. I don't know how long it will be until I follow through with it.P.S Thanks if you read all that. At least there's someone out there who cares..."
Who Can I Turn To?,"I've been in psychiatric hospitals 5 times and I'm coming 17 soon. I've attempted suicide more times than you could imagine, I've been raped multiple times, I have no friends, my family hates me and I'm broke. To make it worse I'm also resistant to medications and talking therapies don't work for me. Anyone i know leaves me alone. What do you do when your at rock bottom? Anyone got solid advice cause I'm lost.."
I will probably kill myself in a week,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, I don't want my few friends to know because they'll try to stop me. Probably also be posting this on subreddits that have helped me to say thanks.About 6 months ago I was dumped by the first girl I ever truly loved, before that I was getting helped for my depression and starting to feel better with her by my side. Everything is different now. Since I've gotten back to college, and back to near her, I've stopped going to counseling, stopped talking to everyone about how I'm doing and acting like I'm really happy to when I think about slicing my neck open at least every minute.I can't focus on school or friends. I'm too afraid to leave my room, my school is very small and I don't want to see her so instead I just rot away in my personal hell. The few friends I have rarely ask me to hang out or talk to me so I don't have much of a social life.Everyday all I do is think about my ex, she's the first thing I think about when I wake up and last when I go to sleep. It hurts me so much to see her so happy and doing well without me while I'm still upset about everything. I guess depression doesn't make that any better. I wonder if she even still thinks of me.I've been blowing off classes and it's only been 2 weeks, I've gone to maybe 3 classes. All I do is sit around and watch stupid videos or listen to sad music.I was told that this would all get better, that after a few months I'd be over here and that's clearly not the case. I'm so sick of feeling depressed and even when I'm not thinking of her, there is always something else to make me upset. I have nothing going for me and life just sucks right now.So yeah, after this week I will probably end my life, I'm just going to take this time to say goodbye to the people who matter to me and just so I can take a quiz, that's the last thing I need to not do."
My small size is pushing me towards a breaking point.,I'm a fat young adult.  I'm not very good at that many things but I do want to get better. I know there are things in my lifestyle that I can change and am changing. I'm eating less food and I'm working out more. I'm trying bur thats not my problem. I've always had self image issues being fat and all. I'm self conscious about every part of my body and recently I've come to the realization I have a small penis. I get this might not be that big of a deal to a lot of peoole but it is to me.  I can change my hygiene and my weight and with enough work I can get better but I can never change what's down under.I don't want to kill myself over this. The more I think about it though the more I feel like my genetics are making me let down not only myself but also my parents. If I get s future partner would I even be able to pass off the legacy my parents left me to another? Am I letting them down?  Am I letting my partner down? I get there's more than sex and how big your penis is but my penis being small means a lot to me. I got a bad roll and its too late to reroll.  I dont know what I should do anymore but the more I thinj about it the less reasons I find for living.  If anyone can help please help.
Alone and introspective,"I hate myself for being this way. I have a great marriage. Husband is amazing and supportive. We are very comfortable financially. My family is crazy with their own shit going on but are generally loving people. Friends are plentiful and kind. I'm educated and easy on the eyes. I turn 32 soon and don't think about suicide as an urge when I'm stressed out or emotional. It's just kind of an accepted end whenever things get to be too much.Been dealing with kind of covert depression for awhile with self harm behavior for as long as I can remember. Suicide always feels like a decent/reasonable option, like leaving a party you didn't really want to be at anyways. It's constantly on my mind as a way out. Just spent an evening by myself today and as I was heading home I casually thought about walking in front of a bus. Why didn't I? I wouldn't want my husband or family to deal with the fallout. ""What would people say?"" Lol.Does anyone else feel like you're mainly wearing a mask for your loved ones so you don't jostle their idea of your perfect life?Just looking for insight, I guess. "
I feel silly posting this when others surely need the help more than I do,"I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place; how do you find the capacity to be a good person when 99% of the time, it takes more energy and ability than you can muster to do so.  (Yes, it can often take 'ability' to do the right thing, it is not innate or a given to some/many in this stupid-ass universe.) I know people say that doing the right thing isn't easy, but what does it say about you when it's consistently out of reach?You are supposed to be yourself, but what do you when that's a bad choice?  And then how sick do you have to make yourself while you ""work on becoming a better person"" as an indefinite project, either in the forefront or the background of your life?  Hell, I think we all understand now that we can't do things like ""pray the gay away"", meaning there are some things about yourself that won't change; what the hell do you do then?  Good people get cancer and die suddenly, so what the hell are your prospects like?One of my biggest motivators in life is believing that my circumstances can change, whether through luck and/or my own actions, but sooner or later it just seems like life comes to find you with that deep pain, that deep shortcoming that takes away all hope of change.  Are other people just that much better/stronger/smarter than I?  I don't know which thought is worse; that what I fear to be unchangeable is truly unchangeable, or than it could or can change, and I've simply failed to do so.It's the worst when you see the happy, the attractive, the successful, the good; sure, it may not be as it seems inside a person from an outside view, but are you telling me that some/most of the people are not living better lives, have meaningful or satisfying relationships, etc etc?  While I was unsure, scared, indecisive, reserved, a lot of people were out there really living, growing, experiencing, connecting, feeling on top of life.  Not only did I not experience that, but I will continue to not experience it, because they will keep being them and I will keep being me; shit, such depressing thoughts.I'm getting kind of tired of this me vs the universe bullshit.  I get it, we are just humans, but fucking shit, we are PEOPLE, sentient animals with dignity, all of us.  I won't settle for being a second-class citizen of any kind, and neither should you.  It's just crazy how much your experience can vary as person, being very abstract and existential when most or all of your needs are met, but then very base and biological when they aren't.Oh well, back to dreading tomorrow, back to not having answers.    I'm hungry now so I'm a lot less likely to make a bad choice.  It's kind of funny how much biology runs the show.  Tonight was pretty bad, I wonder how tomorrow will be.  They say to take it day to day, but is there much point in simply surviving?  Most people with anxiety and depression know how to survive like a mofo, internalizing all that misery, over all that time, maybe even to the point where your loved ones don't even realize how intense your experience is.  Hell, people are drawn to power, so why would you want to show any of your weakness?  Just keep it all inside.As negative as I sound, I don't hold much of a grudge against people; I think that ultimately, environmental factors play a large role in forming people, and as such, it's more the universe that I dislike; I hate the way things go in this existence, it's just so arbitrary.  At least with a game of cards, you could calculate probabilities; what such reassurance do you or I have?  It's great if you have things figured out, but when you don't... holy shit is it bleak.  I hate the idea of suicide, but I don't want things to keep going on this way.  But I also don't think they can be changed.  I'm no superman, so I'm at a loss now.All I can say is that if you are feeling down, for what it's worth I'm in your corner; I don't even have it that bad, and I can't cope.  I truly believe that it's who I am, too, so that ""be yourself"" shit goes right out the window.  It just sucks."
Feeling trapped,"Hello everyone. I don't know why I'm writing this here, I guess it's because I catch myself contemplating doing this thing more and more. The pain is so great, I feel it broke something in me. The main reason is that I don't feel that, due to climate change, there's going to be a future for my child where she can live happily and have children of her own. This makes me break down every time  I see her coming back from work or helping feed her. Every smile or a cuddle is like a stab in the heart. I know she needs me, that she needs me to be ok and fight for her, but I don't know how to continue like this."
Enoughs enough,I really dont know wat to do any more my boyfriend of 10 year has left me i have nothing my life is not worth livin i already self harm and feel like just ending it all
Death,I am always told there are people who is out there to help me but my friends dont response to my messages and when they do they get scared. My family the only way I know how to talk to them is by yelling I get frustrated when they try to help why do they bother there is no point. I'm a waste of space worthless human being who was probably a mistake. School is stressing me out I graduate in 2 weeks then it is exams once that is over I have to wait to see whether I will be good enough to be accepted in UNI. I am not good enough I wont achieve anything in life so why should I bother to continue living. But I'm scared I can never do anything right I will probably fail at killing myself. The only thing I have available to me would result in death just health implications. Should I just mask how I feel for the rest of my life get some anxiety meds to hopefully make me function like a normal person. I tried but when its been nearly 4 years of suffering. Sum everything up I hate everything about myself i am not good enough for anything I dont deserve anything in life since I am a pointless worthless human being. I envy people who are death. I wish I was them
I don't know what I'm living for anymore,"There was a time when I would just buy things online and wait for the package to arrive. That used to give me something to look forward to. Nothing expensive, just some small things for my pc or an acccessory maybe. But I know that I really have nothing to look forward to in the end. After every package it's the same old ""Why do I suffer at all?"" I can't really find anything to keep me going."
Why doesn't anyone care.,My Empty Record Message
Should I stay or should I go?,"Today is the day. But I am having second thoughts. I have tools in my backpack to do the deed after work. I want to go though with it, because I hate myself so very much, and I feel like my life in in an irreparable place, and i just want this ball of paranoia in my stomach to go away. I am scared of the damage im going to leave behind. I have no empathy left for family. I could care less how my parents or siblings are going to feel, my girlfriend is not going to be to happy about this. I have twin daughters who are 10 months old, and they are the only people who I actually care for. They do not understand, all they will know is daddy isn't around anymore. No more playtime, no more funny faces, no more snuggles. I want to push through for them, but I cant... I just cant handle these emotions and this constant whirlwind in my mind anymore. I am such a piece of shit for even thinking about this. I am in my office right now until 5, and than i want to do it. I may go to the hospital instead, I haven't decided yet, either way, this is getting settled tonight."
I set the date for Nov. 1. Advil and Bleach.,"I'm thirteen and i cut. I feel like a failure and a disappointment. Everyday I wake up alive is a day of money, energy, and breath wasted. I'm fat and I don't deserve to live. I guess I'm kind of at peace for now. Everything is set up. I have a plan that's probably too detailed for my shit. I'm selfish to think this way, I know. People have it worse than I do and they care too much for me. They should give all their attention to my younger sister. She's kind of spoiled, but she's really smart and talented. I wasted my time when I was younger and didn't work hard enough. I ran away from home when I was nine, heading for the railroad tracks, not to run away after my mom and dad dragged me down the stairs and tried to hit me with a hobby horse. I was barefoot and was dragged home by the police. From then on, I started to be depressed. On some days, I would withdraw from my family and friends. My mom and I fought more often. She cared about high math grouping. High grades. She made sure I didn't read too much fiction. She pushed piles of non fiction books at me. She told me I wasn't smart. She denied she ever said anything when I confronted her. I started to cut when I turned eleven. Just scratches, no blood. Then I found glass and a scalpel. I cut deeply until my mom found out. She gave me the silent treatment for a day. Then I found myself halfway up railing on the Kennedy center roof in DC on a school trip. I regret not jumping. I cut more. I cried over a bottle of pills. I wrote over five separate note hidden in my room. I made a plan to jump off the golden gate bridge. I saw 3 therapists. And here I am now. I'm done with this life. A little over a month left. I've told myself to stay strong, keep the mask I've been keeping for four years from crumbling. I've given up all hope. "
Like I'm stuck,"Hello, never thought I'd find myself posting here as I'm not ready to die, although I do live everyday wishing I already was/ never born. Since I was in second grade I've had feelings of sadness in me, baseless feelings as I grew up quite loved and still am, it wasn't until my junior high school years that I really started feeling the way I do. I don't want to live the way everyone else does. I don't want to work a job and live by society's rules, I want to just go my own direction but I can't, we live in a world that's run by money, I have no motivation to work or earn. I just want to do me and go on, but I can't. I feel like I'm just wasting my time, I'm not gonna do anything so why am I here now? I just wish I was still in the endless nothings of prebirth existing with everything and everyone at once but instead I'm stuck here at 19 with no motivation to take myself anywhere. Just waiting for the day my parents kick me out because I'm not doing anything so I can disappear and they can forget they ever had me."
I'm so afraid,"I can't do anything that isn't already part of my routine and recently those things have become difficult as well. Going to work is the only thing I can do alone anymore. I used to be able to go ti the store alone but now I have to rely on my brother because my anxiety is so bad. I'm so afraid of what other people think about me, how they perceive me and every little thing that could go wrong, even if I know that it's improbable. I have trouble sleeping because I just lay in bed thinking through worst case scenarios of things even though they're almost impossible.It wouldn't be so bad if anxiety was my only problem but it's not. I've known that I'm transgender for a while but I can't really do anything about because I'm so afraid. There are plenty of people in the community who are willing and able to help me and they've given me good advice but I'm too afraid to do anything. Plus I'm poor. I work in retail and they've been cutting our hours significantly because of corporate bullshit. I was already making so little but now it's worse. I'm also an alcoholic so I tend to prioritize buying alcohol over anything else.I've been suicidal for a long time but these past few months have been so much worse. I'd been putting it off because I hadn't found an easy method but things are so bad that I'll do anything if I think it'll kill me. Hell, I almost got excited when I heard that Irma is supposed to be one of the most powerful storms to hit the US but I live further up the coast so it will probably lose a lot of energy before it gets to me. Regardless, I'm probably going to kill myself soon because I can't deal with my problems and it's all too much for me to handle."
"Life is on repeat, and there's no way to stop.","Every year I think the same thoughts, do the same nothings, cry the same tears. I want this year to be the last year. I want this time to be the last time. I want out, but my body would rather hang around in this suspended animation. I want to turn myself off. If anyone can help stop this noise, please send me message."
Suicide vent,I wish I could just escape who I am. I'm so dissatisfied with myself. I feel broken. Blah blah getting better is too much work. My brain doesn't work like it's supposed to. Feeling broken at all is too hard to accept. It's too hard to laugh about. It's too hard to joke about. It's too hard to talk about. It's too hard to connect with people. It's too hard to stop feeling anxiety. I'm a whining child who would rather complain about how unfair it is that this is my life than do something about it because that feel impossible. Other people have it way worse than I do. Some people didn't even get to live this long.  What the fuck is my problem?
Troubled mind,I am a 25 year old male with depression and suicidal thoughts that wax and wane for the past 3 years. I feel I am unable to deal with the stresses life brings me. I feel so inadequate and useless despite being relatively smart in school and having a degree in chemistry . I feel I'll never be able to achieve the only dream I have of becoming a doctor. This brings me down so much that I have contemplated killing myself many times . I know that many people will think I am much better off than they are and I probably am. But even where I am I constantly do battle with toxic thoughts that keep coming back. I sometimes wish I wasn't alive anymore so I won't be able to let anyone down in the future. I have the means to get it done. My family really loves me and I shouldn't be crying like a little bitch and appreciate their love. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY BRAIN! I'm not the same person I used to be.
I'm 16... I don't want to live anymore,"I made this account just so I can share my story I need some comforting as I sit here writing this tears roll down my eyes, thoughts running through my head thinking is there really any point living anymore? I am turning 17 next month but I don't want to be here anymore. I have extreme anxiety and depression and I try to hide it away from everyone, I keep everything to myself and shy and embarrassed to tell anyone. Due to my anxiety I pushed everyone away I lost my best friend of 14 years and all my other friends so now I have none, my mum and dad are not really supportive about my anxiety and don't understand, I feel like they don't love or care about me, my little brother treats me like shit and I don't really see my older sister as she lives far away from me. I have no cousins that I can even hang with as they don't live in the same country as me, my mums side of the family live in different countries and my dad side of the family live far away from us. At 14 I had a 2 year relationship when I thought I was really in love and found my future husband ( I know sounds stupid at such a young age but I guess that's why... I was so young to know anything about love)  to who I lost my virginity to, where I was mentally and physically abused and hit and threatened and controlled and cussed for the last months of the relationship, everyone was telling me to leave him all my friends, my sister, my mum, even my school teachers but I didn't listen to them and I chose to find the good in this toxic person because I loved him but one day I finally had the strength and realised I deserved much better and left him because he was also cheating on me which left me heartbroken and which triggered my whole anxiety and depression and has left me as a broken person till this day, he also made out I was the bad person in the relationship and somehow he got everyone to believe him because everyone thinks that I did him wrong when I really didn't and they don't know what happened behind closed doors, but after that relationship I was so hurt so I kept meeting up with lots of boys with my friends and getting drunk and kissing and hugging lots of boys just to feel loved again but I would NEVER EVER  let my broken heart lower my standards to go and have sex with these boys but rumours got spread by my ex and now people call me a ""hoe""  and all his friends (girls) see me on the streets and try to fight me or call me names. My parents have noticed I have changed and became such a angry, short tempered, unsociable person even my ex best friend kept telling me I had changed. I used to smoke I started with cigarettes and it lead to smoking weed all day everyday, I used to stay out until midnight also drinking alcohol, lying all over the roads and floors throwing up but also enjoying myself so much, the reason as to why I turnt to weed and alcohol is because it made me feel better about myself and made me feel more confident and I could be myself while I was high or drunk I felt happy funny, talkative,bubbly and so happy with life. I find it so upsetting how I have to take drugs to make me feel like myself, but I haven't drank or smoked in quite a while due to being inside my house all day which I think is making my illness worse. All I ever do now is sit in my room all day on my phone I only go downstairs to get my food and bring it back into my room to eat. I go to the hospital twice a week due to some problems I have but that's the only time I really step out of my house since I lost my best friend. The tiniest things can make me cry and hurt my feelings and I hate feeling this way I want to be strong and confident. I also feel fat, everyone tells me that I am slim and that I have a big bum, I have a flat stomach and that I have a beautiful face and all the boys go crazy for me  but I just can't stop eating due to feeling upset all the time and being inside bored. My mum and dad don't ever get me anything anymore, they used to spoil me get me whatever I wanted and treat me so special until I changed and now I'm starting to think the way they treat me is my fault because of the way I am towards them, I feel like they only love my older sister and little brother and that I am the odd one out. There was always jokes made about me being found in a bin ( my siblings would say it when I was annoying them) but even though they are joking it makes me think maybe I was adopted due to not feeling loved as much as my siblings by my parents.  I have to start college and everyone has already started whereas I have not even applied for one due to not wanting to go to any where I live because of all the people where I live screaming nasty things to me that my ex rumoured about me to everyone that even my ex best friends are joining in with it. I really wanna move house out of this place where I live but my parents don't want to move yet but the more and more I think about it there just gonna be everywhere so I had asked my mum if we can move country to where her family are but she said it would take at least 2 years and I can't wait that long. I also deleted  all my social media due to being scared what everyone thinks of me or getting rude messages from anyone, I really want to do my course or apprenticeship and make some money for myself but I am too scared to go out and do it and meet new people!! What am I going to do :( my mum and dad don't understand they keep telling me off for it and saying I have no ambitions when I really do, today a education lady from the council came to my house to speak to me about college and further education and my mum told her about my anxiety, she is also someone that helps with anxiety and depression so I am going to have sessions with her and hopefully she can help me get better but I feel like this anxiety will never go away I've had it for years now... I've just had enough, I also used to cut my wrists but I stopped a year ago, something happened this year which made me do it again but that was the only time. I am even afraid to post this incase anyone hates on me but there's nothing I can do, I pray to god every night to make my life better and protect me I guess it's all up to him now because I really feel like leaving this life forever and I'm sure no one will care ..."
I can't keep doing this.,"I don't care that this is on my main account now.
I don't want to spill out my life's guts, but I know I've struggled with severe diagnosed clinical depression and suicidal thoughts (some attempts) for 10 years now with a multitude of different contributing factors.I've tried seeking out help. I've tried various treatment methods. I keep trying to look for reasons, to find things that help, to find my last desires to live. I want to make it through. I desperately want to not feel this way. I hate when I cycle back to depression whenever I've been making some actual positive progress in life and with myself.Am I worth coming out the other side?
Am I worth getting through this?
I don't believe I can win.
It's getting increasingly hard to pick myself up and try through each day, through each moment.
I feel this impending doom in knowing that if I continue along this downward spiral, I won't be able to find any more will or effort to make the choice to keep fighting."
Day 2: Curly Hair,"I have beautiful curly hair.
I never really saw how nice it was until later on in my life when I saw other women of colour rock their curls.
They were so healthy and bouncy.As a child I grew up in a predominantly Caucasian town. There was one Afro-Centric boy at my elementary school, and one other mixed girl.
Her mix however is Japanese and British.
My mix is Irish, and Bajan.
My mother never really knew how to take care of my hair. As I grew older my grandmother told me to cut my hair.  That's not true though. It was my father who told me to cut my hair. I don't know why I stuck to that story for so long.I was often bullied for my skin colour, my hair...  I couldn't understand it.
I didn't get the joke, or that I was the joke.
My mother is a blonde with green eyes. I myself have green eyes and brown hair.
My skin is not very dark.
Yet I was always compared to shit.I remember a girl hit me and pulled my finger back as I rose my hand to answer a question. I cried of course, and when the teacher asked her ""Why?"" Her response was as simple as ""She's different than ""
When I tried to point out the prejudice in her statement I was scolded and sent back to the classroom.Anyways,
I later permed my hair, straightened it and it was destroyed. Short, dry hair.
Finally into my adult life (about 20 years of age) I decided to grow it.
It took a long while for it to repair itself.I wore my hair down at work today.
Threw together the shaggiest outfit In existence, paired it with some two dollar flip flops and headed out.My day was the same. Nothing eventful or new.
One co-worker even said to me ""You look like you got smashed last night.""
However towards the end of the day many of the girls were complimenting my hair, saying how healthy it looked.
I became really self conscious after that.I hate standing out.
I fidgeted with my hair all the way home.
I thought my hair looked ugly that day, but they kept saying how pretty it was.It adds to me feeling like everything is fake, or my perception is incredibly flawed.
It was comparable to when you see a very fat person, and tell them they are fit. . .Like it's a lie.Anyways. Acceptance from my peers or compliments doesn't change anything.
I still feel so blurry.On the upside, I finally have beautiful curly hair.6 days and counting."
"How to actually stop myself, as someone who has tried the stereotypical advice. ACTUAL advice needed.","When I google the question ""how to stop myself from committing suicide"" I am met with  written by people who clearly haven't had a sad day in their lives. The answers are shit like yoga, doing things you enjoy, thinking that depression can pass, just not thinking about it etc. Its not that fucking easy.I can't do yoga because I am physically disabled - I have a pain disorder associated with hormone problems and traumatic brain injuries (of which I have had both), and yoga makes it hurt worse which makes me want to die faster. I don't ""enjoy"" anything because I am severely depressed and have been for as long as I can remember, even considering I have suppressed memories from most of my childhood. When I was younger sure I had hobbies but I never grew out of them, never expanded on them, and I can't enjoy them now anyway so why bother? Depression is a chronic disease it doesn't just go away its like a cancer of the soul except if chemotherapy was even more likely to kill you. I've met twenty three more people who have survived stage IV ""you have 6 months to live"" cancer I have not met any who survived this level of depression. Most of my extended family is dead from the various shit we deal with. My dads always been lucky enough to just be strong enough that although we both have severe pain conditions he doesn't also suffer depression issues. My mother survives on pure spite and making other people want to kill themselves. I can't stop thinking about how I feel because there's nothing else for me to do but think about it. I'm a physically and mentally fucked up failure who isn't capable of enjoying anything except seeing my own fucking blood and maybe that's just because I'm so used to seeing my own blood (from chronic wounds like MRSA and side effects from hormone problems) that I don't feel like I exist if I don't make myself bleed. I've had to wrap up eight of my fingers and three toes to prevent from getting blood everywhere, plus dealing with the drama of MRSA sores (which come and go as they please and bleed a sick mix of white blood cells and bacteria and blood plasma almost constantly). The literal only reason I haven't killed myself is because it would hurt my wife and I would do anything to protect her from pain, emotional or physical. I put too much weight on her shoulders as it is - she supports us financially with a job she hates because I am disabled (due to severely painful long term effects of a forced genital reassignment surgery and subsequent surgical site infections and sex hormone overdoses before I turned 2). I have no one else. My family was fucked up growing up so I can't confide there. I'm in a legal dispute against my doctor right now for fucking with my anxiety medication in a way that basically EVERY industrialized nation agrees isn't humane so I can't go there. I can't go to therapists because I was molested by a therapist when I was forced to go to one as a child (no one believed me, until finally my mom said she believed me except she also said she didn't give a shit to hear my 'excuses'. I wish my wife didn't exist so I could die in peace. I love her so much I couldn't do this to her but I have nothing else to stop feeling this bad without flirting with the idea of death. She deserves so much better than me. She deserves someone who could take care of her and love her properly. I can't even show her I love her because of how fucked up I am down there (sex is extremely painful and traumatizing for me because of the shit I have been through). On top of my fucking joke of a life, yeah it gets funnier, my doctor decided last week to just cancel my ongoing prescription of anxiety medicine. No stated reason in the documents but when I called the office, the secretary told me it was because, ""[anxiety med] was meant to be a two month trial basis and you were supposed to come back in."" except because of my multitude of fucking problems I have been in the office at least twice every month, and I have been on the anxiety med for about two years now and have reported multiple times that I thought it was helping me. Now that the migraine from withdrawls are over I finally have a refill (because the doctor was pressured/forced into refilling it because of the truth of her actions being considered medically unethical because her choice to force me to stop anxiety medication cold turkey having severe side effects like moodswings and suicidal thoughts).  Even if it weren't for the anxiety medicine issues I have right now... I would still be in chronic, severe, daily pain from the damage to my pituitary gland and from a painful disease process I've been diagnosed with that still has no known cause, and I've yet to find an effective treatment other than getting so drunk, high, or stoned, that even if I do still feel it I don't care any more because of being high. Apparently it was too much to ask to be born into this world without being mutilated within weeks. It was too much to ask to have a therapist who didn't do things to me before I finished puberty. It was too much to ask to live a car crash that should have killed me and instead left me like this invalid piece of shit I am."
I have nothing to live for.,I dont want to be alive I will kill myself.
Hopeless,"I had a falling out with some friends at the beginning of the year and have only talked to them intermittently since. A few weeks ago, I was shown screenshots of them trash talking me for something that was out of my control, and because I apparently started the arguement again, two of them have cut ties with me entirely.What did I do wrong? I never mentioned anything to them, I didn't even confront them about the messages. Why does it even hurt? We haven't spoken for over a month, I shouldn't care!Just 8 months of hating myself for not having the courage to talk to them has lead to this and I feel fucking hopeless."
I'm feeling really low...,"I'm a junior in highschool and I've had my first 2 days of school. A 16 year old boy... I'm a competitive swimmer living in Canada and am training to go to a prestigious school in the US. Recently I've lost all motivation to do well in swimming, school, and anything that feeds success.... I think I'm depressed and today I'm feeling really low. I've been sad for a while. Today was the first day that the idea of taking my own life wasn't a bad one. I probably won't kill myself, but knowing that my brain some how got onto the topic of wanting to kms scares me and I don't know what to do. I'm so lost, I feel like empty. I have one really good friend but I think he's getting really close to my ex now that school started:/ All my other ""friends"" seem so fake and one dimensional and distant. I don't know what I'm asking for from this post but I think im depressed and I'm just lost."
My depression is getting better. Why am I still often fantasising about jumping?,The increased energy and motivation but not full rectification of the problem. It's why anti-depressants have that black box warning. Do you think that might be it?
Suicidal thoughts every hour,"I'm 19 years old person with a clich̩ depressing life situation. I have no job experience, no real friends irl, family is planning to disown me, college denied my application, I made so many wrong turns in life to the point of no return. Also I'm living in a foreign country without able to hold a proper conversation. Right now I'm at home having absolutely nothing to do, trying to find a job is a task I wish I could leave it to the someone else but I realized I'm a so-called adult now. My family constantly pushes pressure on me, I'm very tired, I'm becoming a burden, I don't want to cause anyone troubles. I regret everything, from my decision of going abroad, my life, to the point I wish I was never born. I'm thinking of killing myself whenever my family starts talking to me, they don't make me feel better or trying to guide me in some way. They are adding up the criticsm I already gave myself. I feel like gabage every morning I wake up, I have to suffer another day. I wish I have the courage to go on but realizing that I'm totally alone in this strange land. No one would help someone pathetic like me. I can't stand the way other people look at me when they turn me away, like they pity me. I wish I could just disappear from this world, turn into some kind of flower, star like in fairy tales. I don't really want to live anymore, I'm quite positive at times but when these things hit, I don't see any way out anymore and I just want to end it all here, at a young age with so many unobtainable dreams."
"As im recovering from being unwll, I am feeling so lonely.","lately things have been rough, with medical expenses, a hospitalization from illness and the vomiting, coughing etc... I am so exhausted. Today was my first mostly well day in a while. But... I realized how lonely I am. most everyone in my life messages only if I message them. A few check in on me but... Not many. I noticed people hate hearing im unwell but thats all I have to share lately... Maybe thats why? I just miss people, and im starting to think suicidal again... I feel so disconnected from the world. Anyway, just had to put this somewhere. I did not feel I had anywhere else to share it."
Both my parents tried to kill themselves last week,"Craziest week of my whole life, was called at 4 am that my parents where both rushed to the hospital because they tried to kill themselves.
My mother has been suffering from depression ever since my dad got he's bypass surgery 8 years ago.
My dad did not work for like almost a year, then got he's job beck only to be led off since the company closed 3 years after.
He's 72 now and of course nobody want's to hire him. Me and my brother have been supporting them since then.
My mom got this skin rash issue since this whole thing started, sometimes it gets better, some times it gets worse but his skin issue makes here even more depressed.
Apparently in the last 8 months she has been constantly crying to my dad that she does not want to live anymore and she wants to kill herself. Now my dad is a very impulsive person and he kept telling here that he will not allow her to die without him, so last week with my mother crying my dad just explodes, says ok, let's do this, swallows tons of sleeping pills. Then my mother after him did the same, only that she mixed all kinds of pills, he fell asleep but she was awake, got scared that she he will die and she will stay alive but loose her motor abilities since she could barley hold herself on her knees.
After a while she decided this is not going to work, manages to call for help and then I get into the picture.
Now I have both of them in separate nursing homes since where I live there are not depression or suicide specific help centers. Since they need 24/7 surveillance this was my only choice.
Both of them are getting psychiatric treatment, me knowing my dad I'm sure he will be let go in a month or 2 since he's not actually depressed, the big issue here is that we had to cancel there apartment rental, sell most of there stuff to pay for hospital expenses since they are not insured and sending them to the government hospital would probably kill them so this was not a choice.
I already have some ideas where to place my dad when he's out, my mom I don't have high expectations of her recovering that soon. My mom already knows that we're getting rid of the apartment, she's already depressed and it did not make any more damage to her with the issue. She understood that it was the only way we could help her. My dad on the other hand doesn't know yet, he's a very simple guy, yesterday I installed a computer in he's room with internet and that's pretty much what he needs for he's life, internet, movies and food. He's getting all those treats without having my mom constantly crying about here suffering and it's doing good for him. I actually see him very positive and generally happy as always.
So you guys think I should throw him the bomb of getting rid of the apartment now or should wait a month till he sets in.
Also generally speaking what else should I take into account of this whole situation that's basically flipped my life upside down."
Tried to kill myself and failed.,"Last night, I tried to kill myself. I had been planning to do so for awhile, and finally built up to courage to take the plunge. My method of choice was oxycodone. My mom had a whole bunch from a shoulder surgery that she didn't take, some were 5mg and a few were 10mg.I haven't taken any oxycodone other than when I had my wisdom teeth out 15 years ago, so my tolerance was literally zero. I didn't count how many I took, but based on how many were left vs. how many I had when I started, I believe that I consumed about 65mg in a single dose. I'm not a big guy, about 165lbs or so. I know that people take way more than that throughout a day's doseage, but that's after having built up a solid tolerance, and admittedly I hadn't done much research on how much should've been enough to kill me. But I remembered seeing somewhere that 40mg can be lethal for someone with no tolerance, so I thought it would've been enough since I'm not a very big guy and I didnt really eat anything that day. What I hoped/expected would happen was that I would pass out unconscious and stop breathing. Boy, was I wrong.I simply laid down on my bed, kept my eyes closed and waited to die. I kept thinking about my dogs that I missed so much, and trying to relax and let sleep take me away. But it didn't work out like that. I felt the dizziness kick in, went through periods of profuse sweating all over my body. My whole body became quite itchy. My breathing became very laboured. My heart was pounding uncontrollably. After longer than I expected, I opened my eyes to look at the clock. I couldn't see what time it was, and the blurred light appeared to be bouncing up and down. The slightest movement resulted in the world swirling slowly around me like swinging a cloth underwater. I didn't try to stand, but I know that if I did I would've fallen straight to the floor. I just closed my eyes again and laid there and waited. I'd like to point out that despite all of the physical effects I was feeling, my mind was unaltered throughout this entire process.It turns out I laid there for at least 5 or 6 hours straight, sweating, shaking, dizzy, itchy, taking long deep breaths. It was absolute hell. The whole reason I'm posting this here, is because of one very important part of all of this: You've probably heard that happens before, and I guess it's true. As soon as I realized ""holy shit, I took the pills, this is for real. I've really done it"" I started having 2nd thoughts, and debated picking up the phone and trying to call 911. I didn't, but it made the experience even more gruelling.So all of those hours later, I guess I ended up finally falling asleep, and I woke up feeling like tremendous shit. I  vomit at any point during the experience, which was one thing I was worried about in terms of failing. But I am still dizzy, my legs are wobbly, and I've only briefly left my bed all day. I haven't really eaten much except a couple granola bars, some water, and a cup of coffee.If any of you are thinking about taking pills to end your life, it's not a peaceful pleasant experience. It's an absolute nightmare. I'm still depressed, and I still feel deep down like I want my life to end. I just wanted to share my experience, in case somebody might see it and think twice."
I want to D I E,just  D E A T H
My only reason to live: my angel,"Not long ago, I was depressed. In fact, I still am. I wanted to kill myself. I thought that no one would ever love me and that no one cared. I made a Reddit post saying goodbye and the reasons I would give up. That's when I found another post: it was from a girl in the same situation.We started talking, we exchanged numbers. A month had passed and I started to develop feelings for her. Still, I believed that she didn't like me back. I was wrong. One day I was telling her: ""no one loves me"". She said: ""what if I told you I do?""We started dating. She lives in the USA. I live in Brazil. She will come to visit me in January. But here is the problem: she lives in South Carolina, one of the states that will be hit by the Irma hurricane.I told her that I can't live without her and that she is everything to me. I am so worried about her. I love her so much. If she dies during that storm, I won't be able to keep on living. If she left me, I wouldn't last a week. I would kill myself.We swore not to ever leave each other. Even though the distance is great, even though she is in college and I am in high school (3 year age difference), we will make this happen. I love her so much.I am so worried about her. I wish I could get a plane now and go there. I don't want to live without her. I am so nervous. I hope she'll be okay. I would give my life for her. I would go through any sort of pain or torture for her. I love her. I can't live without her."
Anyone else feel like a shell of a person?,"I've been feeling like this for quite a while now, I don't feel anything anymore, just emptiness. Nothing excites me anymore, it's a struggle to just put on a fake smile for family and co workers. I'm just ready to leave this world behind. Anyone else feel like this and changed for the better?"
Is it inevitable?,"I am extremely worried for a friend. She has a degenerative disease with chronic pain being a major symptom. 5 years ago she was relatively normal girl.These days she can barely go out, sometimes she is too fatigue to even walk  a block. She has been on long term disability for almost 2 years, the disease is getting worse & and depression has been significant and worsening. The meds she has to take to control her disease impair her so much, she maybe has a few ok hours a day... best case scenario.She has a therapy dog which has been a god send for her. Interrupts her panic attacks, follows her everywhere, can lead her to local shops & carry groceries. They are on a waitlist to join a service dog program that helps those with disabilities.But her condo board filed a court removal of the dog within 24 hours notice else a bailiff will remove the dog. I've been trying to help her out with this, she has very detailed medical information that this dog is a necessity, but that doesn't stop the law. The final decision if she can stay with the dog or have to leave will be on the 20th.I know something is seriously wrong, she is very reserved now. I encouraged her to make a Facebook post and IG account posting all this info, she did but she's given up. She doesn't have much family or friend support besides me. She has accepted that society will just outcast her, she doesn't want to fight another day, or have another painful day or puking all day. I can tell she's exhausted.I've even noticed her dog can tell, she stays attached to her hip & brings her stuffies when she's sad & last few times I've visited her she has stuffies surrounding her & you can tell she has sort of gave up on herself.I don't know what to do... I can't stop this, I can't fight the law, we live in a very conservative province and victims are typically overlooked. I can't fight her disease, the only available treatment slows down the progression of the disease, but her benefits don't cover the cost of the medication & it costs about $7500 a month.I don't think I can post Facebook links here, so if anyone is interested in hearing/share her story PM me & I can link you. Maybe if she saw there were other people out there that support her it could help.I just don't know what to do anymore, this feels so wrong to me. She can barely take care of herself, she has no where to go, she can move away back to her family but she won't have the medical support there. It just bothers me so much knowing that she has months worth of pain pills & anti depressants at her place & I'm fearful on minute she'll say fuck it... she has done it before except this time her life is much much worse (less support, bleak future outlook).Does anyone have any advice? Should I just sell my place (I'm not very attached to it) and find  a safer spot?"
Mom doesn't believe I was suicidal. She didn't believe I had mental illness until now. When family members don't believe in mental illness. Has anyone experienced this?,"I'm 25 year old female and dealt with mental health issues all my life. All my life my mother didn't believe I had mental health problems until I shaved off all my hair last year instead of killing myself. Even when I went to the psychiatrist and social worker she still didn't believe I had depression. Fast forward a year later to know she accepts that I ""probably"" had depression last year, but she still doesn't believe I was suicidal even though there were multiple times I tried to end my life. I'm okay and I'm happier (upswing) but I don't think I'm going to end my life just yet. I'm semi happy. Mom doesn't believe I was suicidal. She didn't believe I had mental illness until now. When family members don't believe in mental illness. Has anyone experienced this?"
Some questions about hanging yourself to death,"Hello, I'll keep this short as possible. I'm considering suicide and hanging is the only way I can afford at the moment. I don't have anything to keep myself up, I mean nothing condemned to the roof of the room so I think I'll tie a rope to the heating radiator and jump from the window. I live in 3rd floor which is far enough from the ground. My questions are, if I don't get a neck break how much will it take for me to die and will I make any sound during the hanging phase? I'll do it at night so no one can interrupt my attempt but If it takes more than 2 mins top I'll probably be saved and taken into a mental hospital. I don't want to live my life swallowing pills and listening to fake motivational bullshit. I just created this account to prevent you from doxxing, ratting me. Looking forward for your replies and thanks for reading."
I don't think I am going to make it.,"Hate to post here, but it's real and I know people here will understand.I have been struggling with depression my entire life. I recently got out of the military after ten years and have not been able to get my medication that I had to quit cold turkey about 4 weeks ago.I was looking forward to moving out of state and starting over with my wife, as things were not good for some time and she wanted to sepeerate awhile back and we had. About a week ago she told me she did not love me anymore and did not wish to continue the marriage, I then found out a few days later she had been seeing her boss the entire we were separated, even though for the year we had been trying to work on things I thought.It sucks man, I was molested as a child and raped by a man while I was active duty. Compiled with a lot of other shit I really have no desire to keep going. I have been through large amounts of therapy but I really have lost the will to live. The call of the void is constant now.  I know it will hurt my parents, my cousin killed himself two years ago on my dads birthday. I just really feel like I have no other choice, I do not talk to anyone anymore and spend most of my days alone. Sorry for venting. I was closest I have been to committing in years the other night. I am running out of road."
"I want to die, notes are already written to send to loved ones. Reasons to live no longer outweigh the reasons to die. I don't want to exist anymore.","Throwaway for very obvious reasons:Hey Reddit,I don't know how to be able to word this properly or make any sense of what I'm writing but I will do my best. Long story short, I'm at my wits end and want to die. The following is going to be a LOT of verbal diahhrea so just bear with me.I have had mental issues most of my life, mostly dealing with depression. My mom wanted me to see a therapist from a very early age but my dad (prideful newfie that he was) never agreed to it. So most of my issues went unchecked and was just chalked up to just me being ""how I was"". Fast forward to two years ago and it caused me to lose my significant other, and I became homeless. We have a kid together that I haven't seen for almost a year now. I have been sleeping on couches ever since.Because of all of this, it was like Pandora's Box exploded in my head. Everything that I held in for years suddenly all came out at once. I because wreckless because I just stopped caring. I took out loans to be able to afford a place of my own (I've stayed at friends houses on their couches since), and when it seemed like things were somewhat looking up for me I lost my job. I ended up having to use the loan money to pay for myself to survive while waiting for unemployment to kick in.I have been homeless for two years, haven't seen my kid in almost a year and I miss her so much it kills me. Since my seperation my relationship with my ex isn't good. We had tension since we broke up (our relationship by the end was a fucking train wreck but that's an entire story in and of itself) and when I was able to take my daughter on weekends I had difficulty taking care of her. Like I said with my mental issues I couldn't function at all, let alone take care of a 1-2 year old. So we changed it to visits. Visits became fewer until she wanted me to sign her over because apparently me being the way I was was detrimental to my daughter so it was thought to be best that I back off. It took a month for me to make a response, and I did by email. I explained that I wanted to be part of my daughter's life and wanted to be there for her. That I was trying to get better to be the man she needs me to be. There was just too much to say by text. She never responded, I know she got the email because I've sent her emails before, and she does check that email because she has cancelled any attempt for me to send her money to help with my daughter. I can no longer afford to send money and have given up on that since every attempt to send money has resulted in it being declined and I am charged every time I try to do so.I had to go from one friend's house to another friend's house (I've been at each friend's house for a year now, and the friend I'm with now can't really deal with me being here. He's not said too much minus one email saying he is hoping I find another place to stay, but hasn't said anything since). I've given up at this point. I've been diagnosed with severe depression, type 2 bipolar, and borderline personality disorder. Meds aren't helping. I've been told before I can even start therapy I have to try to find a place to live that I cannot afford (My therapist is suggesting I try to find a place first because if I have a home of my own it would reduce my stress greatly). I've sent in an application for disability (therapist/dr's recommendation) but it could take up to three months to process. I have no money, my paltry social assistance can't help me afford a place, I can barely afford to eat. I'm also a binge/emotional eater (Being referred to an eating disorder's clinic, so eating my depression definitely doesn't help with money). I'm on a wait list for affordable housing but that can take years (I'm on an emergency list because I'm homeless, but it doesn't really help with wait time). I'm ready to give up, I can't deal with this anymore. My daughter used to be the only reason to keep going but now she's gone. My ex got a new boyfriend 3 months after breaking up with me and apparently my daughter calls him daddy now. So she might just be better off without me. I've got lamotrigine I can O/D on, there's a bridge not too far away. I'm just trying to decide between the two. before anyone says anything I've already read what a lamotrigine overdose can do. And I've read what suicide by falling/drowning can be like, but I am past the point of caring.Thanks for listening, sorry for the wall of text. There's lost of stuff I haven't included (mostly because it could be a little too specific, but there's a LOT more going on). Hopefully it wasn't too much.TLDR; My life is in shambles. Soon to be homeless, no money. Owe money, collections calling. I want to die."
Want to kill myself but I'm too afraid to and have no access to a gun,Throughout my entire life I have been in and out of depression. A never ending cycle of feeling a little better and then wanting to jump out a window. It's exhausting. I'm physically emotionally and mentally drained all the time and I just want to be done. It's not going to get better I've been told it will and so I've hung on this long but in reality I know it won't. I'm just so tired. The thing that makes me smile the most is when I think about pulling the trigger. How it will finally all be over. No more waking up to nothing. No more insomnia. No more crying alone in the corner of my bedroom. No more disappointing anyone. No more saying the wrong thing. No more looking ugly and most importantly no more of the feeling of emptiness that can't be filled. It leaves for a little when I have a distraction but it comes back five seconds later. I HATE IT. I'm just so done. I want to die. I'm so tired of crying. I'm exhausted. It's time to go. The biggest problem though is im too afraid. I tell myself it doesn't matter I'm going to die anyway but I'm too afraid of the unknown. If I stay alive atleast I know what to expect. Pure fucking shit. But atleast shit is better than nothingness. Or maybe it isn't. That's the thing I wouldn't know if it was worse or better because the unknown. I want to go but I'm too afraid. I also currently have no access to a gun. That's the only way I'll attempt. Least chance of failure. Anyone know how to get a gun unlawfully and/or the best way to get over a fear of death? Thanks.
Life Is Pointless,"I don't want to keep living.  Every day is an uphill climb.  I wake up in a virtual panic attack, struggle to get ready whilst my toddler and infant scream, cry, make messes and put themselves in mortal danger.  If I want to work out, I have to get up 3 hours earlier than usual so I can be home before my husband leaves for work.Then I go to a job I am beyond lucky to have, and, despite my best effort, do a mundane job.  I am buried alive in debt and even after 2 bankruptcies, know I always will be.Nothing brings me happiness, let alone joy. Nothing.  Everything is a chore.  All I want to do is sleep.I live so that I can suffer another day.  Why go on?"
Am considering ending it either tonight or tomorrow.,"Firstly, thank you to anyone reading this. As the title says, I've been having some serious considerations into committing suicide either by tonight or tomorrow, depending on how much I prepare. This has been something that I have been strongly considering for a few months now. In all honesty, I'm kinda at peace with this decision. While the thought of ending my life does sadden me especially considering what I'll be leaving behind to my family, it also feels oddly comforting; it's like I have a way of letting go. I've cleaned my room, arranged my belongings, prepared my suicide note, and am now just mentally preparing myself. I guess if there is anything I fear, it would be what happens if I should fail in this."
Been having suicidal thoughts,"I keep thinking if I don't get what I want and things don't change next year, I won't stick around
Like, what's the point of being here if I'm not wanted the way I want others?Or my works aren't celebrated?Or my activism is ignored on Facebook?Or I'm belittled or treated like I'm an annoying bug?And dont tell me I should love myself!It's hardIt won't lastAnd I'd rather love others, instead "
He's going to leave me,"I try my hardest to be good for him but I constantly fuck up. It destroys me to see him frustrated and disappointed with me. The only reason I haven't killed myself in the last two years is because of him but I know he can only take so much. I'm constantly miserable and bring everyone down around me, I would be doing them a favor by just going through with this."
Inject me with some happiness. Why do psychiatrists think medication is the answer to everything? They won't provide therapy unless you go on medication or hospital suicide camp?,I'm doing better than least year. Don't have as many suicidal thoughts. But I'm tired of mental health professionals thinking medication is the answer to everything. I'm tired of dealing with horrible mental health professionals that lack empathy. I stopped seeking therapy because I didn't find it helpful and things are looking up. Sorta. Inject me with some happiness. Why do psychiatrists think medication is the answer to everything? They won't provide therapy unless you go on medication or hospital suicide camp?
nothing matters anyway,"living is too much for me, I don't want to be here any more. I want to think that life has a meaning but I don't think it does. I know that for everything good that happens to me, i'll have to live through so many more days of this. It's too much all the thoughts and I've done horrible things that people don't know about and I don't deserve anything good even if it would make me happy. But nothing does anymore because I'm just faking the feelings because I like to deny it when something's badly wrong. My situation doesn't matter but I feel like the only way I could stay alive would be to fuck up my life even more and self-destruct until I die anyway. May as well end it when I want, it'd be so easy as well. I know people would be upset but it wouldn't affect me either way because i'd just cease to exist. I'm not a person who deserves to fix this anyway. I'm sorry i dont know why I'm posting here I'm sitting with a note written and a lot of pills and I'm still too scared to do it"
Literally cannot stop thinking about it,"I don't know where to start or if this will help, but I just need to get this off my chest somewhere.I've struggled with my mental health for years, had some good therapy, some bad, been on a bunch of medications, some worked some didn't.  I've been pretty stable for the past 3 years. Things took a bit of a turn in March/April this year and I guess it's snuck up on me more than I realised. This summer was bad, really bad. I ended up having to move back to the town I grew up in where a whole bunch of bad shit happened, and I put everything down to that. Like the acceleration of falling into a hole. I just sat around in pajamas all day, refreshing facebook, or wandering from room to room crying and trying to figure out a way to off myself without ruining everyone's life. I moved again a month ago, and started a new job. I thought this would help, and like maybe for a couple of days things were much better. But since then everything has just gone back to how it was before. This horrible aching feeling in my chest like someone has died and I've forgotten who it was. I cry, every day. I'm in the toilet cubicles crying at least twice a day, coming out and putting eye drops in and going back to my desk smiling as if nothing has happened.I have very little to be down about. I have some fantastic friends, kind family, my boyfriend of two years loves me to bits and I love him (even though it's been hard to feel that much lately), I have an interesting, well paid job and a home with a couple of great housemates. I am extremely lucky.But I just feel so fucking trapped and horrible. And when I am not distracted I spend most of my time trying to justify that it would be ok to kill myself. I honestly don't know how much longer I can do this. I have a big bag of pills in the cupboard and want to just make all this stop. I feel thoroughly not cut out for life and just broken. I feel like I have some awful defect and as much as it would devastated those people in my life who love me, I don't know how much longer I can do this just to save them from suffering.I feel desperate."
Feeling suicidal yet again,"I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to die and leave behind the people who still love me, I don't want to hurt them like that. But I've just got so much pain inside I don't know what to do, I feel like I'd be better off not being around anymore but I know this will hurt the people who still love me. I feel trapped and in a world that will never accept me and I don't want to be in this shit world anymore, it's so horrible. I don't want to live anymore but I can't do anything about it! It's a good job I don't have a gun because I would seriously consider shooting myself in the head. "
Last help,I am a single 35 yr old woman. I lost my father last year. Mom is in a sorry state very fragile. As a child i was not the preferred one and was sidelined for my sibling brother. I was led on by my bf for 8 years and now I have run out of options to settle down. Since I come from India I stay with my family. I am not treated well. I am also facing issues in my office. I don't have friends. It feels like not a single soul on earth really cares for me. I dream of running away and ending my life every second. I just needed a friend but no one cared. I only see one way out of this misery. And that will benefit everyone. I won't be missed for sure.
I want to talk to someone when I'm still alive... Any volunteers ?,I'm here if you want to talk
"I want to kill myself, but I can't do it","I've been considering suicide for so long. It's almost unbearable. Every time I think about it, I always end up chickening out because of the consequences I'd leave behind. Killing myself would have no purpose since everything that's happened to me up to this point is all my fault. I can't handle it, but I can't kill myself. I don't know what to do now."
Living with a deadline,"It's almost comical how I always fail at stuff. It makes me wonder if somehow some god/a higher being/the universe has made a sort of comedy out of my life, like the shows where the character keeps slipping up. I've always fantasized about dying, what it feels like to not be here, and what the world would be like without me. Ever since I was in grade school, I've always wanted death to kiss my life good bye and send me off to whatever's beyond the brick wall. It was a want that gradually grew bigger and bigger until I was crying for release because I was tired of everything repeating itself, of all this darkness and nightmares. I justified my want as something necessary; all I cause was problems and what the world needs less of is me. So I tried, and just like everything else I've tried doing I failed. I've lost count. Somehow even in trying to kill myself I keep failing, another addition to my list of failures. At this rate and luck I'd probably even be most likely to get myself killed by accident (or by some politician's henchmen or maybe a bloodthirsty policeman, one can never tell in this country)It's been 21 whole years of trying and failing, and I think I need rest. A long one. A deep slumber so I could drift away from this world of mine that is slowly tearing and crumbling. I'm planning on trying one more time, December this year, because everything's too heavy for me. Though, I'm really trying my best to reach December since I almost find myself really itching to off myself sooner. (Sorry if this is so badly written.)Before anyone else suggests, yes. I've tried seeking professional help and failed. There's a large stigma when it comes to being mentally ill in my side of the world, plus meds and consultation charges are rocket high. Additionally, I'm a useless NEET and I could really feel my presence being a burden to everyone I interact with."
This feels like the end.,"I don't wanna do this for one more day. Everything feels hopeless. I'm too ugly to be loved, too weak to go on. I don't wanna do this another day. "
I'm just angry that I exist,"I hate being alive, I hate it so, so, much and I'm really getting to a point where I could end it all. I think the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm scared but there's always a part of me that truly believes there must be a better option.I'm so sad that my parents forced me to exist when they didn't even like each other that much; I'm sad that I'm ugly and stupid and generally a horrible person. I can't believe I have one life and this is the body I have to spend it in and I wasted my entire youth being sad about it and I can't go back and change it and yet I continue to be the exact same way. I sound like such a child but it is so incredibly unfair.I think I'm mostly angry because I've really begun to realise how short life is and that we are in fact incredibly mortal; I hate the way the world is but what I hate even more is that I'll miss so much after I die. The complete lack of control we have over when we die and how much time we have makes me want to kill myself because at least then I can be in control of it. I don't feel in control of anything anymore, I just want it all to stop."
I've been thinking about doing a very public suicide.,"I've been having fantasies recently about committing suicide in a very public place. The last time I did that was falling onto the Metro tracks, but I was saved at the last minute. But now, I've been thinking about a very public suicide, maybe jumping out of a window of a very busy building into a crowd of people would be a good way to go. I was also considering stabbing myself in a busy shopping area and slowly bleed to death while everyone watches on. if I could get a gun (I can't in the UK) I would shoot myself in the head in the middle of a busy street where everyone can see. I would also try and get run over by a train again and see if I can get run over or maybe stabbed by another person. There is endless amount of ways I could go and leave my shit life! These fantasies have been creeping up in my mind lately as well as in my dreams and it makes me feel that I'm ready to go. My life has been shit for so long that I wish i could end it now, but I would much rather make a spectacle out of it!  I hate my life and I don't want to live anymore, I fucking hate myself, I hate my body, I hate myself for not being as good as I should be, I hate living in a shit place and I hate knowing that my future is fucked already! FUCK MY LIFE, I'm going to kill myself and I don't give a shit what other people think. No one cares about me, neither do you guys, you're just here because you want to make yourself feel good when in reality, you do not care about anyone here whatsoever! This world sucks and I can't wait to leave in the best way possible. "
My family is against me I have no friends to turn to.,My family is turning against me because of the mistake I didn't do.I don't have friends to whom I can pour my heart to.I really don't have a reason to live and I m serious this time I have been suicidal on/off. But this time is last time I m turning suicidal
"I'm exhausted, depressed, and a majority of everyone I know would be loads happier if I were to end my own life.","I wake up every morning to at least 2 people calling me names, insulting me, or abusing me in some shape, way, or form.
I'm tired of being called virtually useless when I'm doing everything I can, and when I already do a lot.
I know that if I killed myself I wouldn't have to hear this any longer, which is the thing that seems the best to me. I am convinced that I wasn't meant to make life past high school graduation, and the thing is- it's my senior year, and I graduate in May.
I can't go a day without thinking about how purposeless I am. I don't know what's keeping me here. I have no real reason to be here.
I've had very little life experience, I guess, I won't make it in the real world. I wasn't ever very social or liked or loved. I know my suicide would hurt a few people, but then again, I'm at the point where I don't really care. It might be selfish to some, but in my opinion I'm doing a favor for myself as well as a few other people. How is doing a favor selfish?I feel like suicide is my last choice but...
I'm terrified of what comes after death. I don't want to fail. I don't want to live after a failed suicide attempt. I've failed suicide attempts before & I'm terrified, but I just want to END it. I want no more pain, abuse, or depression. I just wanna be gone. I don't know the point of me posting this here. It's not really serving a purpose. Maybe someone can relate, maybe not.Comforting words would be appreciated. I'm at one of the lowest points in my life. "
I wish there were specific depression/suicide resources for nerds or other smart people,deleted bc idgaf anymore and this subreddit is dragging me down even more
I hate my country and this world so much,"I am not going to lie about this, I am a Chinese. I hatred communism, I hate Majority of Chinese are so conceited and stupid, they bragging about their 5000 years history but tend to forget their life is in a shithole. They are ignorant, always judge people when the situation is not clear, or they think they have understood the whole situation. They are idiots thinking that Chinese is the hardest and language with dense history in the world but never thought that other languages have their charms. They are foolish, ""more child equals more fortune"" is a god-damn idiotic phrase I have heard in my life, some poor Chinese people are struggling with their life but still want to have more Children. In some poorest villages, many left-behind Children are straving and staring at villages gate to wait for their parents to return from outside work, many parents only go back home once a year, some of them don't have money to buy a return ticket. They are hypocritc, many Chinese people acting friendly to you but doesn't mean they will not backstab you. They are jealous, why there are many talented people immigrated to western countries? Because in China, nobody care if you are smart or talented, if you don't have relationship with certain powerful people, your talent is a waste. They envy, they envy western world while screwing up their country. They are Heartless, they dared to add poisonous ingredients into baby' milk powder. They are arrogant and narcissist, they only care about their family and not give attention to puclic courtesy. They will cut the line whenever they want or never queue up. They are dirty, just to see the environment. They are hopeless, I grew tired of being a Chinese. Don't be fooled by China' major city, they are just the image that regime want you to see. Deep inside China, people are suffering.
They can also be timid and scary, timid in front of government officer and be scary in front weakling.
I hate this world for give me such a negative environment for my upbringing, I hate myself, I am going tot end it, once for all."
I've lost everything,"This last month has been an avalanche of bad news. I left my seasonal job and most of my friends were there. I found out that I can't afford to finish college so I lost the rest of my friends and the last three years feel like such a waste of time. I haven't spoken to my family in weeks and we weren't even on speaking terms when we last spoke. My girlfriend just broke up with me because I can't show her that I care about her. Now I have no friends, no job, no family, no money, and no motivation to keep on going. "
i cant talk about it,we may not spend a lot of time together but the only people close to me are the ones who can help me feel better and i feel like.. if i were to tell them about.. it would kind of damage the relationship if that makes sense? not necessarily ruin it but hanging out with them would definitely be different and i dont wanna lose what we have but if this keeps going on i will lose it anyway
Fucking end everything 14 years old,"I�۪m 14 years old, it could sound pretty crazy that at my age I want to end everything but it�۪s the truth since 4 months I have suicide thoughts, I been a cocaine addict since 12 cause family problems and life has only getting worse than ever I had talk with my only true friend but she didn�۪t even helped only make me feel worst, I don�۪t have nothing to lose so here is my last hope to live.
If anyone thinks that could help me give it a try."
"I'm fucked up. I thought I was becoming happy. All downhill again. Don't want to go therapy but want to. I like my shitty minimum wage job, boss, and coworkers but I hate being 25.","I'm tired of everything. I have difficulty connecting with therapists. Finding a good therapist is like buying a good pair of shoes or buying a car. I'm tired of being 25. Suicidal thoughts over teeth
Depressed about how fuckboy doesn't like me
Sad because I didn't get the job offer
Disappointed that I don't have any good offers just AmazonI'm just tired over everything. My past is messed up. Therapists triggered me. I have a fucked up past because of fuck boys from my past. Yet I still want guys validations. Single for five years because I was uncomfortable around guys (ex: abusive guy friends, bad relationships, etc.)I wish guys liked me.
I wish someone would offer me a job.
I wish I wasn't who I am.
I hate my teeth.
I hate looking in the mirror, yet I'm obsessed with makeup. I'm tired"
I just...don't want to be here anymore.,"I've been listening to that song by Logic, 1-800 blah blah. It's like...the song was written for me. I feel such pain constantly under the surface. Nobody in my family knows about it. I've become very good at hiding my depression out of shame. But sometimes I let little jokes about suicide slip, thankfully people saying 'I'm gonna kill myself' has become mostly a joke, even a meme. As long as I laugh after saying it and say 'just kidding' my family doesn't get concerned.I'm dealing with some shit with my dad, he hates me and has manipulated everyone in my family since we were all born, he has cheated on my mom countless times (as I got older I learned he even gave her STDs from cheating). He makes fun of me for my weight, has told me to stop eating a dozen times. As a result I have gone off the deep end of anorexia a few times. I think the longest I haven't eaten for was a week, but I almost passed out from walking up the stairs so I ate eventually. He just...gets in my head so much and affects me so deeply that I feel like dying.I remember one time I was outside in the garden, sitting on a lawn chair. He told me I shouldn't sit on it because I probably surpassed the weight limit, and I might break it, and it was expensive. When he went inside, I got off and checked the tag. The weight limit was 350 pounds. He really thought I was over that weight. Even as a young kid, he would emotionally abuse me 24/7. I spiraled into self-harm and had 1 suicide attempt, nobody knows about that attempt. The only person I have ever told was my old therapist (who I had to stop seeing because I turned 18 this year, and she only treated youth). My real father figure, my grandfather on my mom's side, died of a heart attack when I was 11 years old. It broke me. He was my best friend. He was more of a father than my actual father was. He hated my dad...he always did...and he did his best to hide that from me, but when I got older and my mom began telling more things my dad had done, I began to realize why.My mom is the only parent I have, as far as I'm concerned. The thought of her dying is making me cry as I'm writing this. I know if she died...I would kill myself. I couldn't live. I think her still being here is the only reason I'm not dead right now. That's really all that's holding me here right now. Aside from that...I'm completely empty on the inside. I just want to die. A couple times I've held a cord in my hand in front of my closet and contemplated tying it up there and hanging myself. I felt so numb, so ready to just...say goodbye. But I can't. Well...I couldn't. Now I don't know.I've been writing my 'will' as I call it for a few months. Every few weeks I will come back to it and add a little more. In it, there's a personal note to important people in my life, from my past and present. Really, its just one giant suicide note. I've been stewing over this for months, really ever since I was 12, but seriously stewing for the last few months. I'm just so lost. This post is a mess. I've been watching 13 reasons why. well, rewatching it. ive read the book too, when it first came out. I feel like...im exactly like Hannah baker. I mean...look at me...nothing nearly as bad has happened to me. ive been sexually abused as a kid, emotionally abused, bullied, all those things. but still not as bad at Hannah in the tv show. I feel so selfish for feeling this way. but I cant help it. I feel like half of the time I'm not even in reality, like other people are more in touch with reality than I am. there are voices in my head, thoughts that come and tell me I'm absolutely idiotic and worthless. ive been having derealization too. I have periods of being happy and 'normal' and then times like this when I'm so suicidal and depressed that I cant even function. I feel like I'm going crazy. and the worst part, I cant even tell anyone about this, because my family will think I really AM crazy...I'm on a gap year right now because I don't know what I want to go to university for. its hard to decide what you want to do with your life when you cant even decide if you wanna be alive. I guess I just...needed to get this out there. I'm so lost in the world, nobody understands me, allllllll my friends from school have lost contact with me since I graduated, they are still in school and I feel like they are alllll having fun without me, acting like I'm not even in the world, not like they paid much attention to me in the first place. I always fade into the background. even in school it was so easy for me to slip out of class halfway through because I'm invisible. that was my catchphrase throughout high school...im invisible. people thought it was a gift, I can skip any class I want and the teacher wont even notice I'm gone. but really...I truly was invisible. nobody could see that I was not okay. not even my closest friends. I was always a quiet kid, never really smiled, never really talked in class, so I think people always assumed I was just a quiet person. but really...99% of the time in class I was trying to keep it together and nto cry. I just don't wanna live. my life has been so bad that I want it to end. I don't even know. just please "
Worried partner.,My partner suffers from deep depression and is showing signs similar to previous suicide attempts but is closed off of me and their family. Any tips on getting them to talk about their feelings before it's too late?
Withdrawal from Paxil is no joke,"This is horrible, this drug should not be legal if this is how you feel while trying to get off of it. Feel like I've had motion sickness for the past week. Cannot find any relief for the nausea or vomiting. Actually felt like I was shaking last night.. if this actually lasts 6 weeks there is no chance I'm going to make it. "
I don't know if I can do this or if I even want to anymore.,I wish I liked me.
My six year old is tucked away in bed,"If I don't wake up tomorrow he'll be a millionaire at my age and that gives me pleasure. I can't find joy in life anymore, everything has been an uphill battle and I can't find the strength to keep carrying on. I just wish I could find a reason why I still should keep fighting and I can't. I'm stuck in a downward spirrel and can't find a way off this ride.Killing myself would be extremely selfish of me to do, if I didn't have a child I wouldn't even give it a second thought.I'm sick of feeling this way. I want to feel normal again, I want to love life."
i'm going to kill myself,i'm a 14 year old girl and i want to be a boy. nobody cares about me. i just play video gamrs all day. people lie and say they like m but i know they're all juwt pretending. i'm sick of all of this. i want to die. i wish iwas normal.
I fear for my future,"I am 25 but I am afraid I won't make it to 40, I live with my mother and father, my sister moved out when she married.I am sure I have Aspergers and I know I have depression and social anxiety. I have a very hard time holding down jobs, I don't really get on with my parents as they are very old fashioned Irish types who think you just need a job to sort out your depression, they love to slander me behind my back, my mothers favourite hobby is slandering people especially her siblings, I have bad genetics with alcoholics and depression in my close family background. I can't move out as I couldn't afford rent and even if I had a job I still couldn't move out as I wouldn't be able to fit in with housemates, I am essentially beat both ways and unfortunately I worry that I will be gone by aged 40, though I suppose that wouldn't be that bad since I would have lasted longer than many of my forefathers from 100 years back."
eh.,"im not 100% sure when i might take action to kill myself yet, but im going to get ready soon. my gcses are around the corner and the only subjects im good in are science and math, that doesnt matter since im in the n level stream. i may be one of the top students in class but my other subjects can drag me down and im actually really fucking stupid. other than all the education stress, bulimia decides to cling onto me since june of 2017. ive been doing it non-stop since. it takes up most of my time now and i would either 1. starve or 2. spend 3 hours each binge and purge sessionfamily issues also barged in near the beginning of the year where this drunk prostitute from my fathers side of the family decides to barge in and thinks shes superior enough to let her hatred towards my mom drive her to spread rumours and manipulate other family members. she tried to physically attack my mom at one family gathering and i ended up fighting and strangling the bitch. now i feel nothing but hatred and betrayal from the family because everyone begged me not to call the police, stop fighting, etc. i only recognize my dad and mom as family now despite them hating each other. sometimes, my dads side of the family comes to visit my dad, and when my mom isnt at home, they would take the opportunity to talk to me but i would throw shade at them or give them short answers. sometimes, they give me money as if they fucking pity me or are trying to bribe my trust. fuck, i dont want to feel like a orphan or a beggar, im doing well without having to deal with them as much as i had to in the fucking past.dad is basically driving himself insane since hes getting old and skipping multiple work days. he also tells me constantly about how he doesnt want a funeral and just wants to be cremated. as well as reminding me that when i leave the house(get married) hes going to kill my mother slowly, torture etc. hes all words and no action. did i mention he stays home 24/7 most days and is racist as hell? (he denies being racist but all his verbal remarks and actions with our muslim neighbours differs) my mom is just lonely and barely hanging on, trying to help this sack of burden here to get a good education, live healthy, etc etc but shes kind of a hypocrite and has 0 knowledge about food and nutrition(just like my dad) and tries her best to ignore other possible mental disorders i might have. (ptsd from the family fight, depression from bullying in kindergarten, primary and secondary school, anxiety from wherever the fuck it came from) i have had panic attacks infront of her, i have randomly started crying infront of her, i have screamed and yelled at her because i was too scared to eat, but she just always tries to blame it on something else, ""this is what happens when you use the internet so much"", ""you got your fathers genes"" etc. i had three very close friends. one of them is skinny and emotionally abusive girl , another pretty and charming girl , and one funny and reckless guy. lets name them x, y and z respectively. y left me first because apparently she has found other friends who are much more humorous and flattering, then z because he found that my personalities and humour was dying along with my body through bulimia and x? she hasnt left me yet, just constantly sticking to me on my worst days to drive me insane.haha. yeah. thanks for letting me rant, reddit. "
I don't wanna fight anymore,"I've been more or less depressed for 5 years. I dont wanna do this anymore. For me life is constant pain (also physically). Im addicted to opiates/pain killers.. I have absolutely no energy to do anything, I cant go to work,  I dont want to see my friends at all anymore because Im just so tired. I feel pathetic living like this and Im just a burden to everybody else. This aint life It's just me trying to survive day after day. My family and my boyfriend are the only things keeping me alive, mostly because I dont wanna hurt them by killing myselfNothing can make me happy anymore. I dont even wanna be happy, I dont want anything anymore. Nothing really matters and I'm just wasting time here. I think I should just quit"
getting ignored by other redditors is awaking my histrionic personality,"so i keep posting shit posts, and gain even more ignorance.oh suck this is killing me.
why is reality even better than internet
how could it be....  omgOMG   hell the shit pisses me off"
loved one of a suicide victim?,what does it feel like for the family and friends of suicide victims? how does it feel 10 or 20 years after? do you ever get to find a peace of mind about it ?
Freshman in High School. I know I'm young. I don't care.,"My parents are abusive. My class has already made friend groups. The kids from my old school have been settling in fine. I have a feeling my only friend thinks I'm annoying. I failed getting valedictorian for middle school, it was my dream ever since my older sister got it. I'm a failure. Nobody talks to me at school. They wouldn't care if I died. I know I'm too young. I don't care. I want to die.Edit: I can't believe the amount of advice I'm getting. I love you all."
"IAmA mandarin chinese don't go 2 school don't work for years, like things of anime or game","OH hi guys But i havent really talked to anyone today. need someone to talk to.anime is really great .
i want a wifu."
I guess I'm done.,"My whole life I've had a different aspect on life. I've never truly been religious, nor thought about my future. It's my senior year, I've had one attempt and hospital stay which helped temporary. I'm taking online classes and have a few months till I can grad and enlist, but I don't want to. I have amazing family members who have pushed me torwards I.T and getting different Certifications to help me get a better job in the army, but again, I don't want to. I constantly have sad thoughts at night driving, wishing I had someone to text and risk my life whole driving to talk to. Tonight I went with friends and seen IT, a few girls were with us and I hit it off with each of them. But the one I liked the most turned out to just be a ""hoe"". Apparently my buddie and another friend were planning to run a train on her, showed me texts and everything. Then she didn't snap me back, so I guess my confidence took a hit. Another girl hit me up on Instagram, and don't get me wrong, she's hot but she's not my type. She's the type to over react to scary stuff and act like she's a baby. I guess I just don't see a reason to live, I'm lonely but only because I can never be happy with what I have. I'm probably going to do it tomorrow after drinking some and maybe smoking, I want to go out happy and on my own terms. Thank you guys for taking the time to read this."
I don't think suicide is selfish. I can't hang on for other people.,I am in too much pain. I can't hang on any longer just to not make other people sad. They don't have to feel my feelings day in day out.
Feeling overhelmed. Currently looking for ways to kill myself,"23, been depressed for the past 10, the few friends I had moved elsewhere. I'm currently living in my small and dead town with my two parents. Besides them i am completely alone. I never had a girlfriend, I've always loved one which never saw me as anything more than a friend (and I never even tried to tell her my feelings knowing how fucking ugly and repulsive I am) and she is now living her life god knows where. I have no past, no present and no future. I've been sleeping  10+ hours for the past few months to minimize my waking life but its just not enough anymore. Going to kill myself and end this miserable, pathetic and excruciating fucking life. Yes my parents will suffer. But on the other hand its their fault for having given me a life that I never wanted."
I feel I'm ready to die for a pathetic reason,"I been suicidal the last couple days, I been reaching out for a lot of help, but I still feel the same. I just want to die because I can't get a girlfriend. I know getting a girlfriend is a privilege, one that I'm not worthy of. It eats me alive, I know its a pathetic reason, but it's the truth. I truly can't see my life being happy without a girl, and I truly can't see myself getting a girl. I just want to die and be over the pain of it."
When you feel like nothing matters anymore.,"I feel my life is so empty right now. I feel like I don't have the strong to do anything right now. I have been in psychological treatment for around 4 years to heal my depression  but even if I have all my medicines I still feel like is something missing in my life. I don't have the Strength I used to have before. I just feel numb. I don't want to do anything. Even if I am having the bigger opportunity of my life I don't want to do anything. Sometimes thinking on the suicide makes me believe alive, makes me think that there is an easy way to feel alive again. To avoid the pain I feel inside of me. Everyones see someone that is constantly smiling but this is not my reality, this is just my mask, my presentation card, inside I am just a lonely sad and boring person. I'm into a whole where everything just becomes darker and darker. My only hope is to have enough Strength to finnish this, just one more I thought but my reason is so afraid that I couldn't finnish. I'm completelly alone I find no reason to live. I'm a disgrace to my family, I have no friends, always in the darkness!!. I am so tired of everything or everyone. I just want to rest, to disapear, to simply evaporate... Where is my Strength? Where is my hope? Where is my love for live and dreams? They don't exists anymore. I'm just a hopless person in this world. Someone whose existence is just a problem for his family. I'm so tired of being an obstacle for everyone else. I just want to be free. I just want to feel alive again..."
I set the timer for 150 minutes.,"It's been like this for a year. Things have not improved.Woke up this morning. I set the timer for 150 minutes. Put it in God's hands.Two and a half hours passed.

Love you always Mum and Dad. Everything will be fine Annabelle.I can't write well anymore I'm too sad. Have to go.  Train nearly at station. This is my suicide note."
"Help, a rant","I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post. I hate talking about typhus to my close friends cause I feel like they dont understand, I feel like no one does. I've been chronically depressed 4 years and cut a little bit and have tried suicide once. The last 6 months though I haven't been very suicidal, I've been wanting to conflict self harm though and I have. I had a girlfriend and every time I cut she would be devestated and cried and I felt so bad so it was like mind fucking me to not cut when I wanted to and one time I punched my arms and face until I bruised, I hate myself haha. I've noticed every time I get so depressed like I am now, my main concern is that I'm not talented enough I have no meaning on this earth, and also I feel like I always disappoint everyone... my mom, ex girlfriend, family, friends, I feel like a mistake God made. Anyone else feel that way? I'm sure some of you do, I don't know where I'm trying to get to, I'm just so fucking sad I feel empty and numb, like I have crossed the threshold of depressed. That's all, and I don't want to talk about it except here cause I'm anonymous, yeah that's it, you guys have a goodnight! "
I can't believe I just tried to walk off,"I was in some stressful situation (really not THAT stressful, like I've had a lot worse but I have a lot of pent-up stuff from the past few days) and I just announced that I had to go. Nobody questioned the fact that we were miles from town walking, I don't have a car, and that the only bus stop nearby went out to the city 20 miles away. I don't really know, I was just kind of numb. I packed everything up then walked out. I didn't know where I was going. I had a thought to take the bus to the city, but then what? Go back? I could go home, but that was a few miles uphill, and I didn't really feel interested in going home. I kind of just wanted to keep walking forever and ever...disappearing came to mind. So did suicide, which is not an unfamiliar topic to pass by me....then someone leaving the place from where I'd walked early pulled over and offered me a ride, then insisted when they noticed that I looked distressed. I'm home safe now. I'm just freaked out that all that happened so quickly and without barely any premeditation. "
Im scared school is going to drive me insane,"I had a massive mental breakdown (my second) last year that lasted ALL YEAR and now I suffer from PTSD and have a form of Dissociative identity disorder (depersonalization if youre curious, i guess) and a lot of other fucking things on top of that.guys I cant fucking take this im in my senior year and i have short days but just
its like one thing after the other adding up against me and everyone's telling me not to take a gap year because it'll fuck with my schooling BUT BITCH MAYBE I DONT FUCKING WANT TO BE HERE OR IN COLLEGE OKAYEveryone tells me it's better to be in college but I actually have plans to move out of this fucking god forsaken country and leave before I get the chance to kill myself School is like half the reason i want to fucking stop everything and give up. If that isnt fucked I dont know what is. If i have another mental breakdown I'm probably going to actually kill myself. The only thing that kept me from it last time was my best friend being in my life. She's still here but if I fucking snap my mental state in half again i dont know if i can convince myself its worth it. Is life just one breakdown after another? How many fucking disorders can i accumulate in a lifetime? How the FUCK DO I GET THIS TO STOPps dont fucking tell me to kill myself it's my decision and I'm not resorting to that until I know theres no other way out"
Tomorrow I come back to the college,"And I'm scared, I think it will be my last period, after finishing I intend to commit suicide. The pain and the sadness will become very strong, I do not have many friends there and I feel like a great encumbrance in my family I think it is better that I withdraw from this life. The girl that I like will be there too and well we do not talk anymore she rejected me and it's okay that she did, it only served me to realize that I will never be able to fulfill the things that I always crave as a child. Classes have never been a problem for me so I would like my family to see what I could have been able to do. I think my final trip starts tomorrow, I just hope I can accomplish this in the end. Thank you for reading"
how to get help when you don't want it,I have and have always had a fear of reaching out for help. I'm scared that whoever I talk to is going to be dismissive.I'm worried if I go for help I won't like who I talk to and won't ever reach out again. Right now I'm mostly scared that if I'm given medication I won't be able to stop myself from overdosing on it. But I know I need to do something because I want to die every single day despite the fact that my life is actually really good and I'm a pretty successful person. I'm also scared that because my life is generally Good I'm gonna get told there's nothing actually wrong. What do I do
I will be free this weekend.,"I don't know why I'm even bothering to post on here, but I don't have anyone else to open up to so here I am, I guess. I've been depressed for 7 years now, and this past year has been the worst. I've never really liked who I was as a person, I'm fat, ugly, untalented, socially awkward, incapable of getting a girlfriend...the list just goes on. I tend to stick to hobbies/things that I feel like I'm good at, but I tend to shift away from them after not too long cuz I just realize that I'm completely shit at everything. I just can't do anything right. The only thing I'm good at is school at this point, and I'm losing passion for the very major that made me go to school. I'm in a great school (top 10 in the world for my field of engineering) and have a good gpa, but I feel like I've given up everything to get there. And I'm realizing that I'm really not that smart...i'm just good at school. And not only that, but being the socially awkward fuck that I am, I can't really get back into being social. I'm a horrible mess, and I hate being me.This past year has been rough because I lost my best friend. Long story short, I ruined the friendship, and she's moved on. I still open her snapchat stories, crying and reminiscing about how things once where. She was the only one I've ever opened up to. We were best friends for 6 years...and she's gone. I don't know how to live like this.Sorry if this is getting long...I'm just miserable. I'm going to blow my brains out with a shotgun this weekend, same way my father died years ago. I'm empty and dead inside and I miss my bestfriend. I'm sorry, Sara. I know I promised you that I would never do this, but I can't. Please forgive me.."
So scared. Someone I love might be at risk. He lives far away. I'm crumbling.,What do I say? What do I do???? Someone tell me it'll be okay.
I'm ending my life tomorrow.,"My loneliness is to the point that I have no optimism. I can't find a relationship and when I do they end in heartbreak. I have no patience to wait for one. I have depression, social anxiety, and I get angry with people easily. If I kill myself I won't have to live this painful life any longer. It's not my fault that everyone else is so full of themselves and immature that they don't respect me. If I leave, maybe they'll realize what they missed out on. I want them to be sad. I want them to cry. They deserve it for every thing they've done to me. Or, for every time they ignored, purposely or not - my pain.They'll cry about how they miss me but they're all liars. They denied my requests for relationships and now I get to leave them permanently. They deserve every ounce of guilt they'll feel. I messaged them all suicide letters or cryptic goodbyes and told them just how guilty they are. Only a few are spamming my inboxes, begging me to stop.Funny how they didn't message me before, though. They didn't message me to ask how my night was going, or my plans for the weekend. They ignored me because I'm fucking worthless to them. So now they deserve to live with my ending on their guilty conscious.Why shouldn't I kill myself? I haven't tried therapy or filling myself with artificial toxic pills yet, are those two any good?"
I will kill myself if I do not get taller,"I don't know why I'm posting this seeing as I'm not looking to be talked out of anything and if months of therapy, counselling and three different types of anti-depressant in increasing doses have not done a thing to shift this feeling I doubt Reddit will. Maybe I just want to write it down for the sake of conviction, I don't know.I'm 5'5"" (male, 19) and never had a growth spurt. I can't accept that this is my maximum height. The only reason it has not been so great an issue earlier is because I was previously given false hope by doctors that I would grow while being simultaneously being put on sex hormone therapy to accelerate puberty and as result speed up the sealing of my growth plates.I refuse to live being shorter than everyone. It is something that some people can deal with but I can't. I cant go outside anymore because being around taller people makes me physically ill and can induce panic attacks of varying intensity. I haven't left my house in days and the last times I did go outside I coped only by keeping my head down to avoid looking at anybody, and piercing my skin every time I walked past a tall person.Some time this week I'm going to meet my GP and ask about being prescribed HGH in hope of alleviating my suicidal thoughts. I strongly suspect he will say no as he does not believe I can get any taller and radiologists have already refused an x ray to examine whether my epiphyseal plates are fused. I considered purchasing HGH on the black market but I wouldn't know what I was doing concerning dosage and don't know if I would get the safe, genuine stuff or some other dangerous drug. Anyway, assuming that I can't get some HGH I plan to commit suicide exactly two weeks from now.There are, of course, also other things contributing to my feeling this way but my height is by far the main issue. I haven't had a genuine conversation in person to anybody outside immediate family and therapists for about two months and all but one of my friends (who isn't aware of how I feel and hasn't met me in person in more than a year) has not responded to any recent attempt to contact them online. I am therefore reasonably certain that while nobody wants me to die, I will not be greatly upsetting any of my friends. Indeed, given the fact that we only ever talk online anymore, and I haven't spoken to most of them in weeks, I doubt that they would even be aware of it.My family are of course a different story, but the people whose feelings I am most concerned about are my mother (who would probably be destroyed) and my Grandmother (who is already unhappy at the moment on account of being ill). I am unable to cope with the pain of continuing to live, but also unable to cope with the pain of causing them such upset. I need advice in this regard, I feel conflicted between my firm intentions and what it would do to the people I love.Anyway that's the situation. I wanted to write it down somewhere, thanks for your time if your still here."
16 year old struggling with life.,"Hello everyone, I haven't posted much on reddit so I hope I'm not breaking guidelines. This is going to be a long write and honestly, I'm very grateful if someone reads all of this. To introduce myself, I am a 16-year-old in college. My parents are divorced and I have no siblings. I am an introvert and I have social anxiety. I have 3 friends in my life. I consider them all my best and only friends. Both of them moved very far away and are also busy with school and their jobs so it's very hard for me to talk to them. My mom fought stage 3 thyroid cancer ever since I was very young until 2013 where she got into remission.  In 2012, my parents divorced after years of constant fighting. I became aware of their fighting when I was 9 when I woke up 3 in the morning due to their fighting. Ever since then I have been fighting with depression since I am an introvert who was consistently bullied all throughout high school. I was hated by most people and I was consistently told by people in my class to ""just go kill yourself,"" ""no one likes you, so it would be better if you were just dead."" I have been struggling with the thought of suicide ever since I was 13. I have switched to many different schools, eventually, I would hear the same relentless words from my classmates and peers. I have attempted suicide twice, both times were unsuccessful when I was 13. I cut my wrists as a way to cope with my feelings. I have been through multiple psychologists and I would feel better for the time being, but after a few days, I would immediately feel like shit. I am constantly alone, but I have a fear of being rejected by people and staying alone. My mother knows about my depression, and she's tried to help before. I have consistent dreams about me killing myself, some feeling lucid. But I would always wake up to the horror that is reality. Fast forward to now, my mom has regained her thyroid cancer and now it has spread to her lungs. She fears that she won't be able to make tomorrow as she's consistently in the hospital. She's having a paid leave as she's in the hospital almost 24/7. I am struggling with my classes as I can't focus anymore. I'm dorming at my university but I feel alone even when I'm at a campus full of people. I can't decide my major and what I want to do with my life and it's all stressing me out. I'm scared of being alone and I have my thoughts tormenting me day and night. I'm emotionally unstable and I don't know what to do anymore. I have to find a way to pay my tuition and I can't get any student loans since I'm a minor. I also owe my father money since I spent a lot on my debit card. I can't love myself anymore, I stopped taking care of myself and I haven't slept or ate in the past few days. I would usually eat one meal a day and that's it. I'm trying to find a job to pay my dad and my school. I resorted to cutting my hair (I had very long hair) and selling it for $100. I can't afford anything and I have held on to that $100 for the longest time. I have told all my best friends about my current situation and it's not like how it used to be. I can't see them on a daily basis like how I used to and it really hurts. I hate being alone as an underaged kid in college with no family and no direction in life. As the school year has just started, I have no idea if I have the focus and motivation to be in my classes. I really want to be in college and hopefully, go to medical school or become an animator.I have constant suicidal thoughts that torment my mind and dreams almost every day and I can't seem to stop it. I've noticed that it has taken a significant toll on my attitude and relationships. I have become a very pessimistic and negative person that repulses everyone that I speak or interact with. I complain that I can't make any new friends or interact with people but I can't stop my negativity. If it wasn't for my supportive 3 best friends I have no idea where I would be right now. But most importantly, I'm terrified that I'm starting to get a personality that is like a sociopath. I have a full prescription of Minocycline 100 MG pills that is intended for my acne, but I just want to swallow it whole and end it all. I've tried twice before and failed. Hopefully, third time is the charm. I'm scared. I want to die but I also don't want to die. I'm confused and helpless. I don't know how to help myself or how to practice self-care anymore. I want to give up. I need somebody. Anybody. "
You Left Me,"You left me in the dark,You left me all alone.From my chest, you took my heartAnd left me with no place to call home.You left me without concernAnd no matter the season,I want to end all of this hurt.And that's my only reason.You left me broken and confused.You left me thinking I wasn't enough.You left me feeling really used.Now my upper thighs are rough.You left me thinking I should die.You left me on a painful highOf feeling burning on my thighsAnd thinking that what I was doing was right."
"Wouldn't it be great, great, if we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown..?","I wish I could die while sleeping... peacefully. Take me out and finish this waste of life. Suck my soul out of my body and reset my mind. I'm tired of having these thoughts. I'm tired of breathing just to live. I'm tired of taking my own life. Someone end it, please."
How do you know when its too late?,"At some point in my life I felt I could get better but now I feel like its going nowhere. I feel shitty for having access to a therapist but feel worse in that I'm not getting any better. I feel like I'm wasting their time. The receptionist, the health insurance rep, the therapist, the psychiatry, everybody. Even my friend who's moved away had been concerned for me but I've been wasting his time.I don't even want to improve anymore. I think my mind is deteriorating from the overwhelmingly negative thoughts that have clouded my mind and I'm now some emotionless husk trying to find meaning in a fucked up world. I don't even know if the world is fucked up because I've heard that the world is what you make of it but I can't see the world any differently than I do now.The voices I've been hearing have been putting me down even more and I don't know what to believe anymore. I believe they've entered the auras of everyone I encounter as I fear every time that their preconceptions of me are enough to avoid any sort of confrontation. I feel so emotionally immature that nobody would find me even appealing. Why society even places such value in finding a significant other is beyond me. I'm sorry for being a deviant but this is exactly why I'm here. I don't want to be angry at people. I don't see myself as one to spite every couple or group of people I see. Seeing that I can't seem to change anymore, I wonder if I was unlucky. That perhaps in some other life I'd live happily. I've been told that the problems are from within. The ""Furies"", they called them - demons. My accomplishments from previous years I'm afraid had not been enough to cure my Furies from within. I'm afraid simply finding somebody to talk to will not help. I don't know what to do. I won't commit suicide. But I'm afraid of living.You've all heard this before and I don't know why I'd ever be different maybe its just that I'm such a deviant that makes me feel special but really I don't even want to feel special. I keep lying to myself and I can't control it. The relationships I've made in recent years have been meaningless and stagnant. I'm getting tired of it all.  I don't even want to graduate. I know I'm young but my Furies will remain. I'm planning my life now: when I'm decades older I'll remain the same broken man I've always been. This delusional individual that had never been able to fully do anything. The deviant that resorts to watching bugs fly into their death imagining that they possess some sort of sentience. I'm sorry I don't have anybody to talk to and I'm tired of writing to my future self in the journal. I couldn't find a subreddit to consult to. I'm just so confused.I don't want to die but I'm so close to living in a way I'm afraid of. Please help me. I'm terrible at asking for help. I can't rely on my friends in real life. I just can't trust them. edit: tldr: i dont want to die but i'm a piece of shit. let's have a laugh together. you can talk to me, i've been practicing my social skills."
Going to jump to my death in London,"I'm 18 and I wonder why I'm so stupid, I can't even pass my A-levels at college. I barely passed my GCSEs. I'll never make it to university.
Thinking about it I'm pathetic at everything I do. I can't make friends, never had a girlfriend. People always look at me weird like I shouldn't exist. Don't even get me started on my looks. I'm so far away from reality. I don't fit in.
Everyone thinks I'm pathetic.
I'm going to jump from a bridge in London.
//Bye."
I should be dead by now,"But life some how manages to fuck that up for me too lol. I've been craving some good Chinese food before I kill myself today, went to my favorite place and it just happens that of all days, today is the day they're doing a ""deep clean"" in the kitchen so I couldn't order what I wanted. Whatever fuck it, it was just another slap in my already bruised face. I started making my way to the destination where it was going to finally end, I planned the perfect spot for week and what'd you know, roads fucking closed for construction lol... I was trying to be considerate and not leave with a bad image for everyone, but fuck it, firearm it is. ��Ε��"
My dad is killing me,"15 year old guy with depression and anxietyEvery night at 11:00pm my dad turns off the intenet. Whenever I feel suicidal I turn to the internet so someone can talk me put of it. I''ve feeling extra deppressed recently and I'm scared that I might not make it without the internet. I don't know how to tell my dad that he's removing one of the few things keeping me alive. He knows about my mental disorders, but it's like he doesn't even care. I've been thinking of telling my therapist, but I dunno. Any tips?"
The prospect of working a shitty job for the rest of my life just for the sake of breathing may be enough to drive me to suicide,"I graduated college with a liberal studies degree like a fucking idiot because all the stupid college advisors, parents etc assured me that I would be fine and I wouls get a job. It's now going on 6 months and the only jobs that i can get are shitty customer service jobs which I rathee kill myself then take. Why do people bother working when that is literally all they do? I can't grasp it for the life of me and nobody else in my life seems to understand the issue. I rather die then sell my fucking soul. I was at the top of my fucking class, I wrote an award winning thesis. Now I'd be lucky to get a job at fucking walmart. College got me absolutely nowhere. I would be better of it I didn't go with my current degree. If I could go back in time I wouls have went into a STEM field. But it's to fucking late not. How fucked up is society that you have to make the most important decision of what you want to do for your entire life at 17 fucking years old. Fuck the world, fuck our shitty dreamboat education system. I can't live like a useless sack of shit any longer"
Anyone want to talk? Hopefully not just text,I'm home most of the day by myself and everyone I know only wants to text. Having the voice or video of another human being means so much. Makes it hard to reach out sometimes when all you do is pound out words on a keyboard or a phone. Wish I had someone or people who didn't mind audio or video conversations. Feeling suicidal and needing  that human contact.
Brought up in a sick world then I lost everything I had worked for when I became schizophrenic,"At age six I was abused, then age 12 I was propositioned for sex, then at the same age I was asked to take my top off. At 14 I had a man of 26 interested in me that makes him a pedophile. Then at 17 I had sex with a man of 26 it was wrong and I feel suicidal about it. Then I was taken advantage off in my teen years, then at 22 I was sexually assaulted by a photographer. Not only did he assault me multiple times but he completely ruined my life. I did beautiful modelling work and never wanted to model again. When I was 18 I fell in love with with a man five years older than me and I had never experienced anything like it. We were madly in love and he taught me so much. We smoked weed together and i was already sick from a young age with borderline personality disorders but the weed made me think. It made me think about the world and that we live in a sick twisted world and everyone is sick and evil and I know that my experiences have shaped my beliefs about the world but I truly believe we are over run with evil. That we live on a hell planet. One day after all this and more had happened to me, I was smoking weed and I started hearing a voice, it told me to smoke the weed more and to watch the smoke in the chamber. I thought it was some kind d of spiritual awakening and my third eye had been opened and I was able to access the spiritual world. I still believe that to this day. That this world is not what we think and it could be a world that is so much more beautiful than we can imagine. I started to believe that there was a god and my voices were guiding to become more and more spiritually enlightened. They told me all kind of things. They took me on a journey. They told me to look up a documentary called war dance and I had never heard of it before and it's about the children in Uganda who were forced to murder their parents. I did everything the voice said, or voices, I couldn't tell if it was one or not, told me to do. They told me to get all my slutty underwear and put them all on then it told me that each one represented a sex slave and to throw them in the river. It told me more and it revealed to me what I was like and I don't think it thought I was a good person in a lot of ways. I was told what it was like like to be homeless, I was told to look at the stars and I saw the southern cross over and over again in the same spot. One day I came back to my boyfriend's place and there was always weed there and they told me to smoke the weed again and after that they told me to clean the place which was an absolute pig sty because I had been taken away to hospital, pinned down by 7 men over and over again while I was screaming and begging them not to drug me, that I didn't need drugs that I was on a spiritual awakening and I needed to see these voices or the teacher plant weed through. That the weed and my experiences was teaching me what kind of planet we are really living on and it's full of sickness. So the place was a mess and I cleaned it for hours. My boyfriend was always working and never took care of the home like I did. The voices were helping me they were waking my mind up like ayahausca does. One day the voices told me to open up my gates and let my husky off the lead the voices talked about freedom and that my husky belonged to the universe not me. They told me to follow her into the streets and told me to say come and she came back to me, when she came back to me I was so thankful that she had but then the voices told me to let her go again they were teaching how to train her. I'm a dog trainer by trade and she was already well trained and she loved me dearly. My husky had come from a couple who owned her and I had been training her. I would walk her three times a week and I would take her into the Australian Bush and let her run off lead for hours we walked and ran for hours free in nature like she should be. Like all animals deserve to be. She would follow me everywhere then I would drop her home. One night I was sitting in my garage with my boyfriend, as we live in a small garage where my boyfriend build the bed so it was on the ceiling so we had more space as he is very intelligent, and here was Harley at my door. She had escaped from her owners house and had come to find me so we spent an hour with her before returning her home. After a week or so I got a call from her owners and they said we want you to have Harley because she sits at the gate and howls all night for you. So we took her and she became my dog. She was under socialsed as a puppy and I made her into my little dog training side kick. We went everywhere together I even stopped seeing my friends and my boyfriend and my dog became my life. She helped me train other dogs and came on all the dog walks I did with me. She was my angel and I was doing angel work. I was helping people and she was helping me. I was setting these animals free and giving them a better life and they loved me like I loved them. So I set Harley free like the voices told me to and I got upset because the voices started telling me to walk to the city barefoot to prove my love to my love like the spiritual girl I was but somebody called the pound and I was crying on the floor because I didn't want to go to the city barefoot and they came and took my dog away and took me into hospital. There were signs during my spiritual trip... Like numbers, the voices led me to a house number 69 and they had been telling me to do 69 with my partner as it's equal and beautiful . And we can both get high naturally off oral sex because he used to do it to me all the time and make my mind run wild. The hyper priming that went on in my brain while I was getting oral sex was incredible. I can't think of another sign ATM. Anyway they took my dog away and put her in the pound they said they were going to kill her because she killed a cat but in hospital I prayed for days and for hours and hours on my knees praying to God because the voices told me to and my dad manage to get her sent to a large property in the northern territory to be a pest control dog because there are no dangerous dog laws in the northern territory. God answered my prayers. He saved her through my dad. When I was hearing voices my boyfriend had been ignoring me. It all started after I got back from visiting my mum in the UK I was a lonely person but I had my dog and my boyfriend. There is so much more to the story but I can't tell it all just yet I have thought about writing a book but I'm still dealing with everything that has happened to me. So I was all alone in hospital with the pound trying to kill my dog, my boyfriend who I loved so deeply that I would die for him was ignoring me because he just thought I was sick and couldn't cope with it plus I had set Harley free and he blamed me for losing her and was really really upset about everything because he loved me so deeply. I called him so much that the nurses called me stalkerish but they don't know true love like I do. That we are all slaves to money. Slaves on this planet like my boyfriend had to slave his life away to support us and I never got to see the love of my life in this one lifetime that I get on this planet. I was too Ill to work full-time and we were living in a garage so needed the money. Unless we became completely off the grid like we had planned on doing. It all fell apart I lost my dog, my job when they locked me away, my sanity when they injected me with drugs against my will. These drugs they give you are bad for your soul and your brain and made me feel incredibly ill and stiff and I couldn't shower properly I couldn't move, I couldn't talk properly and they never made the voice go away, the plant that was speaking to me or the God or whatever it was that was speaking to me no amount of drugs made it go away. Then I ran away to England I lost everything and I was so sad so so sad. And I ran to england. I got a flight assesment done and they said I was ok to travel after a month in hospital the voices stopped and they said I could fly to England. So I ran away from the drugs because my doctor said I had to be on the injection for a year but when I got to England, my mum, nan and grandad made me go to the doctor's and made me take my medication which did nothing but make me sick and the doctor said I was far too over medicated and took me off the injections. She still thinks I'm talking the pills but I'm not I haven't told anyone. They block dopamine receptors in your brain and make your brain produce more receptors to compensate when having an over reactive dopamine system is what they think causes schizophrenia in the first place. So the drugs just cause you to have an even more over reactive dopamine system. Not only this but the drugs reduce grey matter in your brain and cause Parkinson's like symptoms. I have not heard the voice again for the month that I have been here except for one hour one night. I have been having terrible nightmares. Nightmares where I have a hole in my stomach and my insides are falling out of it, I was looking at my heart pounding on the ground and my body was made of dead fish. It was strange I've never had a dream like it but I think dreams are spiritual things trying to tell us something. So after all this I have been having thoughts of throwing myself off the cliffs that I live on because I don't see myself ever being happy again. I lost the two loves of my life and I will never see my angel dog again. My spirit animal. And I just can't deal with that. It would probably be better if I my boyfriend hadn't left me before I came to England. The reason I left was because they were going to drug me for a year and my boyfriend broke up with me. I'm just so miserable I think the world is sick and evil and I keep having suicidal thoughts for good reason and I can't take drugs just to pretend that I don't feel this way when it's a completely valid way to feel. I want to die. Part of me doesn't but part of me does and im just so sad. I'm hurting so bad my heart aches and stomach aches and my head hurts and I cry and I stay strong and pretend I can cope but just sometimes I think of throwing myself of a cliff and how much better it would be. Can anyone help me I don't have any friends except my nans dogs and my best friend who is in Australia. I missed a couple of things that happened to me. When I was hearing voices I was told to run through my boyfriend's parents house naked which I did they had all godly ornaments all over the house and the voices told me that it wasn't God and they weren't really truly spiritual people. I ran through the house and into the drive way and they told me to dance in the street like I danced in the strip club and told me if I thought I was so beautiful why I couldn't I dance naked in the street. Another time was I followed my boyfriend to work on the train and the voices told me to do lots of things and I filled him an hour into the city he kept telling me to go home and I just kept following him listening to every little instruction they game me word for word. I went into the city and he went inside the building and I broke into his work and called his name but he ignored me as he was on a call. I left after that and went back to the train station and the voices told me to jump in front of a train but I didn't listen to they then told me tell out that I was being told by my voices to jump in front of a train and two people started following me and they called the police and I was taken to hospital again for more trauma. After I wrote this post I dreamt that I was in a tunnel behind a man on a scooter and I couldn't get past him o started to suffocate on the fumes and in the end I got out of the tunnel and could breathe. This is some kind of sign either advice on how to do it or...not. this is my Instagram "
i don't want to stay anymore guys.,"there's nothing to my life anymore. i don't feel lucky or want anything, or want to be in contact with anyone anymore. my face and head hurt these days. i can't talk to anyone i know and whoever i have tried to talk to even my close friends or whatever ahven't come back. i feel so weak these days. my life is now on autopilot and the way  i never wanted it to be. there are billions of people unluckier than i am but i dont' deserve what i have in more ways than one. social anxiety isn't much of a problem but my brain feels scrunched up now like i'm getting a gun pointed at my head when tomorrow arrives. people have given up on me and even my parents. there is no incentive to talk to me anymore and nobody does it, and not many really want to reply either. i have made myself distant from everyone else by trying to be the funnyman in the room. how fucking bitter i've turned. that's all that's left, now that the humor's dried up. nobody's laughing and especially not me. this is so goddamn tiring and it hurts a lot. i'm old already.and it's not that i've become something extraordinary in all this isolation. i have rotted. i am completely worthless and in no way redeemable. people who were invested in me and had faith in me walked away. i cannot even help anyone i am incapable of doing this. i'm barely 25 and i've been away from everyone long enough to silently do the deed. no one's missing anything, for twelve years i've been jerking off and going to bed and insulting others for laughs. who gives a shit. this is not close to a news story to anyone within a mile of me. and the oh-god will turn into a shrug. and i'll have rid myself of all this. like i'm stuck in some godforsaken contraption and i cannot move. the frown takes more muscles but comes more naturally to me. i need a bit more sleep this time."
"I cant take this much longer, i NEED to kill myself","Everything is just getting worse and worse. My whole world is falling apart around me. Im longing for that moment that i gain enough courage to do it. I never have the chance. Im going mentally insane. I cant think straight. I cant do anything properly, and noone seems to care if im struggling.Im losing what little i have. I used to have 1 friend and i drove them away. I dont know how or why. But they seem to despise me. And my family hates me, i hate myself. Whats the point. next time i get the chance. Im killing myself. Dont know how or when, just that i will. "
everything is repeating.,"i can't do this again. i will not do this again. i passed through this once, why the fuck i'll do it again? haven't i learned my lesson? hasn't life punished me enough years?please, not again. i swear this time i'll do it. i won't handle this again, i can't."
It's coming Back,"I never expected to get this far. I was seven years old when it happened, when the one person in my life who had never judged me, probably because he saw himself in me, died. He put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. That�۪s all I know. I�۪ve been too afraid to know the rest or ask. I�۪m ashamed that I still think about him all the time, I�۪m twenty-one now and I still have his picture on my dresser and I look at it every morning. Wondering, was he ever happy? Did he ever love me? Where is he now? He was a broken soul and I fear that I�۪m becoming him every day. I�۪m closing myself off, refusing to acknowledge that the world does indeed go on, even though he�۪s no longer in it. He was never my best friend, he wasn�۪t even that important to me, but he was my first loss. The first person to ever leave me, without a trace or an explanation. I know it�۪s na��ve to think that he�۪ll come back to me or that the answer to his passing will magically fall out of the sky, but I just want to know. Will life ever be okay? Will I find my place? I never expected to get this far. I should be dead right now, but I�۪m still breathing and I don�۪t know if I can anymore. I�۪m not cut out for this world. But I�۪m scared. I don�۪t think I could do what he did and that makes me angrier than anything. My blood boils at my fear, why can�۪t I be strong enough to take the knife and slit my throat? I don�۪t believe in God, not like I used to, I have no family holding me back, so why am I being a coward? He was brave, while I sit here and watch the world pass me by like a complete and utter coward. I�۪ll never laugh a real laugh again, I�۪ll never feel complete again, and I�۪ll never know what it means to be alive. Not while he�۪s gone. I miss him. I miss him more than I can say. He was a kind and gentle soul who didn�۪t deserve what the world brought him. I brought about my own pain; I deserve to be punished in the deepest depths of Hell. I�۪m not a good person. But he was, and he paid for it with his life. I love him. I loved him. I�۪ll always love him. I miss you; I�۪ve never stopped thinking of you. Never once. Please don�۪t forget me."
I feel like I'm going insane,"As the title says. I question reality and whether if any of this is a simulation, figment of my imagination, etc. I heard it's normal for a 13-year-old (m) but I don't know...I have dreams of suicide. Ones where I steal the police officer's gun (at my school) and shoot myself, jump off a skyscraper, etc. I have existential crisises a lot. Not knowing where I am in the world. I always feel expendable and worthless. Nihilism hits me hard and it seems like every life is the same- grow up and be a kid, get an education, get a degree, get married, have kids, retire, die. I've been depressed and suicidal for over 7 months. Without my meds and music I would probably be dead by now. "
Mental Health At a Low,"I have, twice now, strung up my laptop and phone charger cables, with clothing for padding, and spent entire afternoons sticking my head in and out of them. Sometimes I feel like I am about to pass out, and then I pull back. I saw all of these purple shapes of lights one time. I don't even know if I can die this way. I'm kneeling on a blanket on the floor to do it, because of the long lengths of the cables. I am beyond sad. In a psychiatric outpatient program. Haven't been given a medication yet. Am attempting CBT. Am still sad sad sad. Am 35. Divorced. No kids. Bisexual. Type 1 Diabetic. Smoker. Live in Israel. I see these as my reasons for not wanting to live. I want to be happy and stable but in all my years that I was married someone else took care of me. My life has become more and more hellish since I left my marriage. I dunno why I'm posting I'm just reaching out. I need more help than I can seem to find in this world. "
I'm tired of this life. I'm not going to be tired anymore. Actually feeling excited.,"Throwaway.
I'm a 17 yo guy. Home sick today. I have been in a cycle of depression and happiness for the past year. For a month I'll be doing fine but then something triggers me to fall into the pit for a few weeks or a month. Ive tried therapy couunceling, antidepressants, marijuana to try to help the depression but all it does is make me anxious and hungry. I have been in and out of drug rehab for smoking I didn't mind because I got counseling in the rehab place. Well I'm out of it now but I'm back in the pit.  Life has been so shitty for the past year since my mom died of cancer. My dad doesn't know how to raise the family and my family is falling apart. I love my father, he has given me everything I have but he doesn't understand what it's like to wake up one day with no will to live and no desire to do anything besides die. He basicly told me in so many words this morning that I'm worthless because I'm not doing what I should do.I'm planning on my suicide at noon today before my dad picks me up to take me to talk to my school principal about my many absences  and skipping. I have a plan and I'm writing notes now. I write this because I want to talk to people that won't judge and don't have the ability to send me to the psych ward or hospital.
Tldr: planning on killing myself in a few hours. Depression, anxiety, zero self worth, family shit etc."
It is very difficult to find help,"I know exactly how I would do it and I'm not afraid of dying.  I am, however, afraid of failing at dying, and I do have people in my life who would be sad if I killed myself, and so I'm trying to get help.  But I've been unsuccessful so far because I still can't find a new doctor to prescribe me my meds (I take adderall and moved to a new city in may) and EVERY SINGLE FUCKIG THERAPIST IVE CALLED WONT ANSWER THEIR GODDAMNED PHONES OR FUCKING EMAILS.  I have nothing left to give anymore."
On my way down to London for what could be my biggest career developing opportunity and having written a suicide note a matter of days ago I'm at my absolute lowest.,"Hey,So I've been pretty low this year and it appears to be getting worse. I've never struggled with feelings like this until this year - in fact I've been fortunate enough to be an incredibly happy person - but due to many issues in every area of my life all happening at once, I think about how low I am and how I can 'get out of it' very often.A few days back I started writing a suicide note for my sister. She doesn't know what I've been going through and I began to explain the terrible year I've had. Then I got to the point where I was telling her why I was leaving this note for her and not my mother or any of my friends. I believed she'd find it in her to understand and forgive me more than anyone else. I just kept writing and writing until I had a dissertation sized note and I broke down, cried, then stopped writing. I had no plan of how I was going to end it but I hoped I'd have it in me to finish the note and go and do it one way or another.Right now, I'm on the train down to London for a week of writing sessions. I'm a songwriter/producer for a living and will be in the room with many high profile writers, some of which have written for the likes of Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, John Newman, Kylie Minogue etc etc. Not that these names matter, but I want to emphasise how I'm really not in the right headspace for this and I feel so fragile and inferior right now. It's a feeling I've become familiar with this year but I just have no idea how this is going to go when suicide is so frequently on my mind. Stress of this level is not what I feel like I need right now but I can't get out of it.I don't know what I'm expecting by writing this on here, but I felt like I needed to do it.Thanks for reading."
I found myself preparing today.,"I measured out the pills I was going to take today. It was trancelike, normal even. I was just sitting at my desk and I looked over at my pills. I immediately just reached for them and measured out 5000 mg like it was a normal activity. I'm worried that I'll finish it in the same way. Casually, just all of a sudden. Soon. I don't want to hurt my family or anything, but I'm finding myself wanting death even if it means taking more painful methods now. I don't know what to do."
"Jammed a belt through a my top cupboard and looped it around my neck, nearly fell off my computer chair freaked out and managed to take the belt off. I'm so scared of dying but I don't want to be here either :(",One day i will have the courage to kill myself. That day will be the best day of my life. I hope It happens as soon as possible _��_
Does anyone feel sort of worse going on this sub or other similar subreddits?,It's great to see people that understand but almost all of us feel like we aren't gonna get better. What's the point? Why do you come to this sub?
"I'm writing a story were somebody is talked out of cmmiting suicde, it's suppsoed to be positive, help with making it tru to life","Like the title says I'm writing a story were a teeange girl plans to jump off her high school roof. A school counselor and her best friend ralk her out of it. Before the counselor and best friend get to the roof they call 911.So I know when talking to a suicidal person you're suppsoed to be understanding and kind. But I'm not sure what happens after they talk the girl out of jumping off the roof.Would they take her to the hospital? The best friend is taken in by the police for qustioning, along with some other students who texted the girl that morning telling her to kill herself.A part of the story involes the best friend going to see the suicidal girl in the hospital. And the school counselor is there, as suicide watch. At that point she gets a lot of get well letters and presents.Also this suicidal girls is a lesbian. One of the reasons she tries to kill herself is because a lot of students call her a ""faggot"" and even her own parents throw her out a few days before the incident.The sucidal girls girlfriend broke up with her a few weeks before hand, and afterwards spread rumours that she fucked animals and had sex with her brother. Even though the suicidal girl stood up for her girlfriend when she was being bullied in the cafeteria for being a lesbian.I'd like any input anybody could offer."
"so lonely, so long, so","Ive thought about death so much, for so long. over 14 years now. Everyday for as long as i can remember i think, just do it. But i never do. Im a coward, or was. Something that kept me before was the knowledge that something is odd in my brain, something i cant control. But i dont know if i want to live with this brain. Not anymore. I see more of what has been. I should not be suicidal and think about death. There has never been any reason. Ive had my share of bad experiences. But nothing to be suicidal over. But this brain keeps going. Its a badly tuned violin, tense and making strange noises. I have it better than most. But that does not matter. I dont know anymore. I gave some people some music today. I dont know. Im fucking lost. Before, i have been lost. I feel so sad and frustrated and everything i just want to start bashing the keyboard. Atleast I write here, so I'm not dead yet. I've never complained much about my odd brain. But now I do. I dunno I just wanna get rid of it. Even tho it is also my best friend. It has always been there for me, the only thing thats been there. Everyone leaves, everyone has better things to do. I do alot, it's not easy with people for me, and it takes a toll. But I endure, I fight for my life to spend some time with you people and you just fucking leave. I know I cant force u to stay, I do not want to, I've never wanted that. Here I am. Tears. I am lonely, and cant comfort myself. I look out the window and it's dark. No rain, I like rain. This feels like the eye of the storm. "
I don't want to live.,"I should be decomposing under the dirt right now. I don't know why I'm hanging on, but there's gotta be something I'm holding onto if I haven't killed myself yet. I will soon, though. Hopefully before next month. "
"Fuck me, right?","I just need to rant, so sorry. ALSO if anyone has any suggestions, great. If not, great too.
So to start, I'm a 20-year-old female, and I have self harmed a LOT over the last 5 years, mostly clean for the last year or so.I really am not good at talking, sorry. I just....don't see why I should even exist anymore. I mean, I had to give up my cat because my last roommate/someone-I-thought-was-a-friend, but who really wasn't, gave me no other choice. She wanted to put him down, I compromised by surrendering him, the only thing I had that kept me clean and safe, to the animal shelter. She then, a week later, tied to shove me down a flight of stairs, then kicked me out of the apartment anyways. So I moved into the local homeless shelter, and it was not good either. God shoved down my throat 24/7, and my pentacle necklace confiscated, then kicked out of there because I said that I did NOT believe in the Christian god.
Now I'm in that position again. I have less than 3 weeks to find a place to live, or I'll be homeless again. and this time, the shelter is NOT an option for me. I have one friend in this town, and his roommates won't let me move in, even though I can pay rent.Goddess, I just....I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm so close to harming myself again, and I just can't take this. I have nothing,and no-one, to turn to here. And there's nothing I can do. I just...I'm so fucking empty right now."
I just want it to end [Rant],"I have CPTSD (complex post traumatic stress distorder) and as a result, I've always felt broken.  My parents would fight and hurt eachother in front of me for years, almost daily, and almost every night was me sobbing in terror.  They'd come to me when I was 5 and complain about the other, and I'd try to play marriage counselor cause I didn't know any better.  They never listened to me, they ignored my pleading for begging to stop, and even today (they are still together for god knows what reason) they are like 'well, sorry that happened to you but that was years ago.'Fast forward to being 31 and divorced, living alone, and having next to no friends.  I ended up the best of my siblings too, which is incredibly sad, and am just tired of trying.  I tried to save my parents, I tried to save my husband, but no one can save me.  After my childhood I have extreme abandonment issues, social anxiety, panic attacks and probably anger issues on top of that.  My husband left me suddenly after 6 years together because I (quote) ""would not play in the snow with him during the last snow storm.""  True or not, that's the reason I need to live with until I die.  We were 30 and despite my being for him during his suicide attempts and bipolar (diagnosed with bipolar 2) meltdowns, it was still my fault.  It's always something I can not fix.  Now I'm hooking up again, with another long time friend that knows how badly my husband hurt by suddenly leaving me, but he's suddenly distant as well.  And it hurts so, SO much that someone who would know my deep abandonment issues over the years is now trying to ghost me.I don't know what I do wrong.  I am extremely attractive, physically fit, self sufficient and really don't ask much of anyone now adays but to be honest and upfront with me.  He can't give me that, AGAIN, someone I love can't give me that, and I don't understand it.  I just want to understand why people treat me like this and think it's OK to dismiss my feelings.  I just want to stop existing.  What, if anything, can I do different then what I have been?  I see a therapist, I don't like any medicine I've taken over my lifetime, I'm afraid this is me and I don't want to do this anymore."
I start cleaning my rant/status at twitter from now before the day comes. Next few week start moving private data to the encrypt disk and implement FDE on my laptop.,"Hey, sup? What's bringing you down?"
"Meds stopped working, not sure how to manage","Hi Reddit, Throwaway here, having a bad time.I suffer from Bipolar 2, a disorder characterized by hypomanic highs and deep depressive episodes happening seemingly at random.  I will be on top of the world for months at a time, followed by being suicidally depressed for years.I've rewritten this post 3 times at this point, never really sure if I've gotten it right.  There isn't really a whole lot to say, but I want to say it right.I live a life of unpredictability.  never really sure when everything is going to go to hell when things are going good.  The nature of Bipolar 2 is that everything is going to go bad eventually, and who knows how long it will be before that happens.I started diving into this depressive episode about six months ago, but I didn't think it would last this long.  I had a medication adjustment, and hoped for the best, but then my social circle imploded and now I only have one person left who cares about me.  She's doing her best, but she's going through some bad times herself, so I can't lean too hard on her.Over the past six months, things have been getting gradually worse every day.  Now I sleep as much as possible, crying when awake, hoping I'll die in my sleep.  If I had a way to just stop existing, I'd do it in a heartbeat, but life isn't like that.  The only way I can think of escaping is through drugs and alcohol, which have become an extremely unhealthy crutch.I have a psychiatrist appointment in a little over a week, but it seems hopeless.  Last medication adjustment didn't do a damn thing to help, why would this one help?Thank you to whoever reads this, I have replies going to my inbox and I'll stay logged in until I forget."
Finding it pointless to keep on struggling in life,"My life up to this point has been miserable, for the most part. I was born with a speech disorder, so I was bullied until about 15. Also, being on the autism spectrem and having  undiagnosed ADHD made my existence almost unbearable.  In addition, my mother most likely had Borderline Personality Disorder and my father, perhaps, had narcissistic personality Disorder, which caused me to parent myself.  I was forced to start working at 11 years old to buy, food, clothing and other necessities. I am now 21 years old attending University and am tired of struggling throughout my existence. Due to being hospitalized during summer and  clinically depressed, I was unable to save up money for housing this semester. Now I have to live at my father's house, which is two hours away by two buses and the train from the University, so a total of four hours everyday. At his house, in addition to the neighborhood being located in an unsafe area, I have to sleep in the car outside, due to a massive bed bug infestation.I was homeless while attending University about two years ago, and lack the will power to do it again.
I applied to campus positions that would have granted house, but, however, did not receive any of the positions. I am currently working weekends and saving up money until I can move out, which would probably three months from now, though that feels like a life time. I realize that life is unfair; however, knowing that life is unfair doesn't do anything to mend my soul. I realize that I must accept my reality as it is and keep on working towards a better future. Ultimately, however, I find it futile to keep on struggling through out my existence, especially for an existence that I ultimately lack control of. Plus, knowing in the grand scheme of things that life is utterly meaningless makes me want to end my suffering even more. "
"im 15 and i hate myself, what a suprise. Its only the second week of school&2nd day and im already tired. i just want to kill myself so i dont gotta go through life, and me missing another school year ive missed a couple years due to depression and anxiety but ive never seen professional help for it","im sick of ruining my own life, if you were in this position you would understand. I cant make friends, im shy as hell and im native american, i feel ugly in school, i compare myself to people, it's horrible. School is my only problem right now. Currently lying in bed when im supposed to be in class, i am doing this to myself. I need motivation, to do the most responsible thing i can do right now. I just cant, you know. Im supposed to be in grade 10 but i missed grade 9 because of myself, i want to go to school and be successful and have a good life but how? When all you want to do is end yourself, idk if its me or school, Im asking for somebody to i can speak to and some life advice, thats all. "
No motivation to kill my self because of depression,"I have no motivation to do anything not even killing my self. I dont want motivation to ""try harder in life"" or to ""chase my dreams"" or whatever. I am 100% done!I just want motivation for suicide . just a little bit It took me so much energy just to learn how to tie a noose. I just need these moments where i am depressed enough to commit suicide but not too depressed to motivate myself to continue my plan. Probably will try drugs"
Not sure what im doing. Everyone i love has left me.,"I posted here a few days ago on a different account about taking a box of benadryl. In the end i only took about a third of the box. Another friend that I love (like a sister) just told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore either today and she blocked me on social media. while i was sad and crying i ended up dming the person i love about why everyone is leaving me. i shouldn't have done that and he ended up blocking me. then i went on skype and i acidentally sent an invite (I was planning on doing that months from now, not today). Now i feel like everyone i love is gone, as my other best friend is also gone aside from the one i loved as a sister. and my romantic love is gone and i feel like a stalker. all ive been doing for thge past few hours is checking what medications i have here would kill me painlessly but the ones that would kill me will just make me die painfully. I'm not sure what to do"
"No longer want to live, no support system. I've pretty much sold everything I own now, I have my weapon of choice ready, quit my job and putting my letter together. Can't live with this guilt I'm haunted by any longer","I need advice because I can't live like this anymore and I just want to end it all. No one loves me or cares about me at all and I just need someone to talk to. I've started selling my things and getting ready to pick my date. I know my post is long but I wanted to give the full picture. Its Been 11 months since I put down my best friend of 16 years, my cat i got when I was 9 years old. I had a terrible abusive upbringing and he was my only source of support. I hate myself for what I've done and I've suffered everyday. I cry so hard almost every night to the point that I throw up.I feel like I missed the obvious warning signs over his last few months... He was keeping to himself and started urinating out of his litter box, vomiting often and he got so thin. He was a very large cat before and I had put him on a diet so I thought he lost weight from that and I started to feed him more again but he didnt gain any back. I took him to the vet to discuss his urinating out of the litter box and vomiting and she told me it was stress and old age and to try a bunch of different stuff that didn't help much. Changing his food helped a little so I just thought he had a sensitive stomach and neglectedly left it at that. I remember being very busy his last month of life because it was october and I was all over the map doing Halloween events. I had finally made a friend and a was so excited I never wanted to say no to her when she wanted to hang out. So I wasn't home much. I didn't spend much time cuddling and playing and just plain loving him. Then I went to a Halloween party and stayed at my friend's overnight until late that day. I got a text from a neighbour saying my cat was meowing a lot and to come home and check on him. I brushed it off because he had a tendency to meow loudly when he was looking for me and I was really hungover and wanted to sleep more. A few hours later I came home and found him, cold and meowing in a tone I had never heard before. I picked him up for the first time in a couple weeks and realised how light he had gotten. He went limp in my arms and looked so sad. He spent his last night and morning all alone and scared because I was out partying and didn't come home. I have so much guilt and hatred towards myself for this. I rushed him to the animal hospital where they did a bunch of tests and said he had kidney failure. They gave me the choice to leave him in hospital until he was stable but then when he went home he would have to undergo fluid injections twice a day, take pills and go for dialysis. There was no guarantee of this being a cure. The other choice was to put him down. The vet said he wasn't in any pain so the decision was so hard. In the end I realized I wouldn't be able to help him with all his care needs and I didn't want him to be poked with needles all the time and be subject to medications and side effects. I now feel so selfish for this because I should have been willing to quit my job and take care of my cat when he needed me to care for him most. Before the vet came in to euthanize him I got some time to have him in my arms for the last time. I couldn't stop crying. I was about to murder my most loving and longest best friend. I saw the little IV in his arm that they were going to use for the lethal injection and I cried. He smelled so bad from the toxins that had built up in his body and he was so cold and wrapped in a blanket. He walked away from me to go lay on the other side of the couch. He could barely open his eyes and he had exudate coming from them. He looked so unhappy. I can't believe I wasn't there for him his last night and I left him alone to cry and be scared all morning. I fell like the most horrible person on the earth. The vet came in and I asked if I could hold him. He jumped as she put in the first injection and then she put in the lethal injection and she asked me to lay him down. She listened to his heart and I asked her if he was gone and she said yes. I sat in the room crying, petting his fur watching him just lay there. Dead. Because of me and what I just did. I covered him with a blanket and left the love of my life alone in that room never to be seen again. The amount of guilt and regret I feel every single day is enough to make me not want to go on in this life. My actions haunt me everyday and no amount of people saying I did the right thing will ever make me feel like I did the right thing. I don't know how to go on and accept what happened and ever be okay with myself. I don't know how I can ever forgive myself for not spending everyday of that last month playing with him and picking him up and just loving him. I took for granted that he would always be there and I always thought we can cuddle and play tomorrow then I got busy and suddenly tomorrow never came. Now I'm left to struggle with the fact that all I have left of him is a album filled with pictures and a ceramic set of paw prints. I will cherish these items forever but I'm not sure how I will ever be okay again. "
"Texted the crisis line, big mess after","I am new here and read another (archived) post similar to this one. I am just so sick about this. I texted a crisis line when I was feeling really down and depressed, a bit suicidal (but stated that I didn't intend to kill myself nor did I have any method of which to do it) the person responding was really rude and I got annoyed, told her she was not helpful, then deleted the conversation and went to bed. About an hour later 4 police officers showed up at my house, searched my house for weapons (which they obviously didn't find), woke my family up and made me go to the hospital where they took all my stuff (my bag) and tried to commit me, but I refused. I feel 1000 times worse than before I made the text. I am a mom and they dragged my child out of bed during the whole thing. I am so freaked out now having police with guns in my house too. I don't even want to leave the house now, I am so stunned by the whole thing."
I wish I was a kid again,"I know some of the people here didn't have the greatest childhood, but still, for me those times were the happiest for me. Everything turned to shit when I've graduated high school. I wish I was that teenager again, being carefree and not worrying about earning money or my future.I could have all the time in the world to enjoy. I could watch cartoons again, play video games and not give a fuck about anything. I miss walking home from school and listening to music. I miss my mom's dinners, having summer breaks, roleplaying with my friends.Now everyone expects me to act like an adult and I hate it. Everyone says how they love being out of school, but they have a job that pays well, a degree and discipline to learn.I'm like that pouting little kid, who refuses to live life and take responsibility. I feel like death is the only answer."
17 year old failure,"Has missed two years of school due to his fucked mind
Has been hospitalized three times
Takes a cocktail of pills every day, became impotent
Is obssessed with mass murder
Sad and anxious for no apparent reason
Should die already but doesn't have the balls to slice his carotid"
I feel so down i can't even be bothered to get up and kill myself,Anybody got some suggestions on how I can do it quick and easy?
"I hate this: ""if you were gonna do it...""","I can't stand variations of this phrase:if you were gonna do it you would have attempted by now
if you were gonna do it you would have done it already
if you were actually suicidal you would have cut yourselfI don't know maybe they are right."
Considering suicide because of my conservative political beliefs.,"This comment isn't much help, but why?"
Because I can't get a hold of a gun or pills,"I'm a former overachiever and recent college grad and school is all I've ever been good at. I'm insecure about everything from my body image, my intelligence, my social life, my finances, entering the field I studied in, and my home life sucks and my parents are making it damn clear they don't want me around. I have nowhere else to go and my crippling self doubt makes it damn near impossible to create any opportunities to look forward to. I've been wanting to not be alive for a while now, but this summer has been the first time I could actually visualize myself ending my own life, and I've recently developed a feasible plan. What's keeping me from buying antifreeze and chugging it on my next day off (other than my current bank account balance)?"
I'm so upset.,"I've tried everything. Changed my entire lifestyle and everything. Taken any piece of advice given, sought all the help I could and thinga never change for the better. To top it all off my parents chucked me out showing that even they don't like me. I'm sick of being alone and now I'm homeless. My work sucks and a can't afford a place to stay on the wages and I suck so much nobody else will hire me. Not that homelessness matters when nobody will ever want to be with you. The only option to not living in this pain is ending it all. Set a date and stayed alive past it by months. I've given life plenty chances to improve. It doesn't. I wanted life to work out but it's clearly not going to. I'm nobody, just a worthless ugly loser that never had a chance. "
Run out of solutions. There is no help.,.
Did I assault someone?,"I am so scared. I recently met with a woman for quick, anoymous sex. She has a partner that likes to send her out on ""adventures"" and we met in an empty parking lot for oral. The bj got a little rough for sure. She got some tongue bruising and a scrape inside her lip from her teeth. Afterward she was feeling really messed up by the roughness. She consented and never said no or changed her mind or asked me to stop. Post event her partner said she is traumatized. My last partner liked rough and, playing it all back, I probably took what people like for granted. I'm freaked. Did I assault her? I can't live with myself with that. I have two young kids. I'm awful. Might I be charged? I couldn't handle that. I hate myself for it. I'd rather their mother be who they know rather than me if I were charged. They're so young, they'll forget their horrible father. I wanted to be better for them. I think not making them go through the confusion is better. Not going through seeing dad like this. I want a good role model for them... not me. I didn't intend to hurt her or traumatize her or assault (?) her. Had she said anything I would have immediately stopped. She didn't at the time but is feeling pretty bad now. I thought we were all consenting participants. My life is over. I want to add I'm currently seeing a therapist for sex addiction and I fell off the path. I already lost my wife due to that and coping without her is already too hard. This epic fuck up cherry on top? Done. Advice? Help? Please.  I'm scared for myself and my kids. I love them more than anything but could never face them after this."
I think I'm done.,"I grew up with a pretty cushy life, I think -- my parents did everything they could to help make sure I was successful, and so did everyone around me. Everyone has high expectations for me since I was young. That said, I've struggled with learning disabilities, severe anxiety, ADHD, and depression for a number of years, and it's only gotten worse in college, despite years of therapy and several different combinations of medication. I don't think I can keep going anymore. As silly as it sounds, I honestly can't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy. It's just constant depression, day after day, and all I've managed to do with everything that has been given to be is completely squander it. I don't even enjoy doing the things that I used to love doing anymore. I've already pretty much figured out that I can't handle the work required to do the one thing I wanted to do with my life, and my only options are to do something I hate for the rest of my life. The only thing keeping me alive is the fear of hurting other people with my death."
37 and i've had enough of life and i want to die,"i've got to the point where i feel isolated, depressed and alone i work in a job i hate.  My boss makes me feel terrible, nothing is ever good enough, sometimes i wish i could hang myself outside my place of work and she can see my dead corpus hanging from the tree as she drive into work maybe that would be good enough? leave a suicide note on my body. I've never dated in my life, i got no children, no family, no friends. My only wish just to end it all i got myself a rope i want to punish myself for being so pathetic loser i hope i fucking suffer. why couldn't i be born normal. I hope i can have peace when i die."
Not doing good.,Came out a few years ago that my dad molested my little sister when she was 8. Never did anything to me though. He denies it. They are no longer speaking. My older brother thinks my sister is crazy. I'm the middle child. It's taken its toll on me as I try to mediate and keep this family from imploding. My wife no longer trusts my parents and my three kids aren't allowed any sleepovers or babysitting from them. Fast forward to April of this year. Met a girl. Things progressed. I was NOT looking for an affair but it landed in my lap. Told my wife everything in August and now my life is truly over. No family. No friends. Alone. Ruminate every day about what I've done and how I've thrown it all away. Depressed. Miserable. Don't see any clear solutions to my problems. Feeling suicidal daily. Not sure what to do next...
A friend I have been speaking to online for awhile said she was going to kill herself. I haven't received a message from her in awhile and I'm worried.,I didn't know where to post this but I'm heart broken and extremely worried. I have to find out if she's alive. Can anyone suggest what I can do?
I'm an incompetent dumbass,Everyone I know knows this.You should know to.
I dont see myself getting better anymore,I used to enjoy things.. even if I was down I could see the light and now I can't. I'm stuck.
I should have ended it months ago,"So I'm 17 and every day I wake up feeling dead inside. I go to a massive high school (I mean massive, there's 1,000+ kids per grade) and I have a lot of acquaintances but no friends. That means talking and joking with people during school and sports, but rotting away in my house or at work the remainder of the day. I've really been trying to maintain relationships with other people but I just end up getting let down. Nobody wants to eat/hang out/ be seen with such a social dumpster fire of a human being. I've noticed that I've been using weed and nicotine (vaping not cigs) on a weekly basis to make life more bearable. I'd say I'm relatively in shape and not ugly by any means but I've been trying everything to make my life better and nothing's working. I've been seeing a shrink for the past year and it's not doing a whole lot. It's my senior year and if this is what the rest of life is going to be like I won't be surprised if I kill myself before I'm 25. If I can't go one fucking day without crying now, how will anyone love me when I have to fend for myself? How the hell did shit crash and burn so fast? Not trying to whine for attention just need a little help. Thanks"
Should I just end it. I really want to.,"No, I know what it's like to want to end it. I have dealt with it for as long as I can remember. I still do most days. If I may ask (without over stepping any boundaries) what makes you want to end it. If you need to talk feel free to message me"
I just ended my only friendship I've ever had and... I don't have anything to live for,"I don't have any friends, I don't want any other friends, I have nothing to live for. I give up. I'm sorry Matana but I just can't do life anymore. I needed you in it but now I don't have you. I've got no future. I'm a ugly, selfish, piece of shit. I have no desire to deal with it any longer. I quit. I'm sorry for wasting your life"
tonight?,"so i might do it tonight. i have a plan, in the event that i actually decide to do it. i have ptsd and i cant get the flashbacks out of my head. the past few nights all my dreams have been about what happened and i cant take it anymore. and im not even scared of dying. im totally calm. i just dont care anymore. last night i tried calling and texting a suicide hotline and i couldnt get through and thats like a sign to me. even professionals dont care enough to try to help me. im just done. "
No more hurt,"If things do not go well this week, I will be ending it all for sure.  nothing has given me purpose. All people want to do is hurt me and I'm tired of that. I can't deal with life anymore. I'm hurting and no one gives a fuck about me. All people want to do is hurt meEdit: I'm still here, surprisingly. Woke up disoriented and extremely nauseous. I'm afraid my method didn't work "
"""My dream is to kill myself in front of you""","I just told this to one of many friends that left me because my depression made me a toxic friend. Enjoy.""My dream is to one day kill myself in front of you and everyone else who left me. I wanted to tell you that. Not that it matters to you. But i just really wanted to say it.i just go to whatever event happens where everyone who left me are all in one place, i look you guys in the eye and shoot myself in the head with a good gun. maybe even angle it so my blood splatters on you guys. i know you don't care or think i'm just acting but that's literally the point. and it'll be my perfect happy ending and i will never again have to live a life where no one i miss misses me back, where people write blog posts about how getting rid of me is an accomplishment, how people celebrate getting rid of me and putting ""no"" on my face on instagram photos and laughing about it in the comments. i'll never have to live that life again and ill be free and happy. i know you're just rolling your eyes reading this but i wanted to finally tell someone and now i have. see you soon."""
"My ex hates me, wont come back.",I quit a job with amazing pay. Moved back in with my parents. Can't stand the stress of getting a job. Going nuts alone all day. Friends have helped but things are getting worse and talking means less and less. My life isn't moving. I just wanted to talk with my ex. I told them I wanted to die and I needed their help. They won't talk. They're not coming back and I can't deal with it. Now the only thing I look forward to is smoking weed and trying to fuck.
Suicidal because people don't respect me. Taken advantage by parents and people. People talking behind my back in school and work. Bullied online and IRL. HR was the last straw. People want me to kill myself. Why live?,I'm done with everything. I'm weak. People want me to fail. They made fun of me when I was successful and now they're laughing at me because I hit rock bottom. NOBODY RESPECTS ME except my coworkers I work with. Fucking HR lied about giving me a birthday card (they didn't give me) when my coworkers called them out on it. HR ignores me or act fake when the see me. They respect the over confident high schoolers at my shitty retail job.Suicidal because people don't respect me. Taken advantage by parents and people. People talking behind my back in school and work. Bullied online and IRL. HR was the last straw. People want me to kill myself. Why live?
Numb,"It used to sting but now it doesn't.
When you called me all those awful names it hurt, as if you stabbed me in the chest, but now those words just go right through me leaving an empty, numbing feeling,only if dying felt this way."
Give me a reason,"Give me a reason to fight. Not for anyone. Dont tell me you care, you don't know me. There are monsters in my head, they want me dead, Im always arguing with my own self. Everyone who says they have only have their own needs and wants to be fulfilled, I am nothing but a tool to them. Abusing my love has become common now for everyone. It's nobody's fault but my own, Im always cold and alone, sometimes my tears fall on the cold floor and makes small puddles. I hate myself"
I think about suicide all the time.,"It just happens, I think of suicide as casually as breathing. I guess I really do hate myself "
Hello there.,"I haven't really written anything in a while or on Reddit for that matter. Perhaps it is because I'm scared of what I might write or maybe I'm scared of answers that others might give me.
Anyways I'm a 24 year old male with everyday problems, as one would presume. I do way to much drinking and cocaine which always goes hand in hand. I got friends, dear friends I might add, who doe the same thing as I do.
I can't say that they persuade me to do anything drug related, but at least they contribute to it. But I wouldn't want to change them for any other person.For what it's worth, I'm sinking deeper and deeper into my own obsession that I'm not happy. So it doesn't surprise me that the longer I go I ain't gonna be happy or even contempt with anything I'm doing. Everything seems to not work for me, and the things I do aren't enough for me.
I've tried to end my self, on numerous occasions. But I can't My life is my life, but it doesn't seem to be my life at all considering that I can't cope with these faults that I have.It seems, to you as a reader, that I'm rambling. And I am. I am rambling to you, but at least I did ramble. Which is saying something from my point of view."
Gonna do it on 18th July 2018,I hope 8 months are enough to change my mind

"Just got another rejection letter; Been unemployed most of the last 7 years, Getting close to insanity","Today, the office at which I currently volunteer (for a mandatory work program in the state, another story) know a lot of people, have my foot in the door, know the President and Founder of the company AND enjoy working at sent me a rejection email today. I was expecting to be hired, honestly.No matter what I do, I get turned down. Over 15 years of customer service experience. A college degree (which as time goes on I realize was a waste of money). Employers don't care about your resume, your experience, or your part-time presence at their company now. They don't care if you have your foot in the door and do an excellent job when you're there. They don't care about your excellent references or your really good cover letter.I've never felt closer to a mental breakdown my whole life. I've been thinking of different things I could do to FORCE change in my life, but guaranteed it would land me in a mental hospital for a while and physically injured. And then most likely I'd get out and still be unemployed.He has no idea how badly he screwed me today. But now I hear the death rattle of my career, and my livelihood. And if I'm not done, I'm very close to being done."
The Last Yell For Help,"Weeks and months go by
And loneliness stands by my side
That's the price - Iron loneliness
That's the nightmare of my existence
Allone - forgotten - let into the exil
Without love, warm, hope
Only longing burns inside me
I hear voices and conversation
But no-one talkes to me
I want to get out of here - I want to get away
I don't know what's wrong with me
I'm healthy...Where are those people who promised me their love?
Where are my parents who produced me?
Where are my friends who stood by me?
Where is the woman who loves me?
Did she forget me?
Did everybody forget me?
Did they abandon me?
Did they leave me behind?
Can't anybody remember me?
Can't anybody help me?
Am I completly alone?
And where's the doctor?
Where are the nurses?
I need! help!
I'm afraid!
Help!"
Hey.... My life before i actually die.,"Ive lived my life to 20 ive dated my own blood and ive smiled like it was halloween. Im a guy whos a gamer just another person right. This is my second time ive bit the barrel of my gun this week. Im alone. Just so very alone. Noone likes me for who i am and i have to pretend to be someone im not. Im 20 and never had a gf never kissed anyone nev' er hugged a non family member never cuddled never even held someones fucking hand. Girls all the time say  or  IF THATS FLIPPING TRUE THEN WHY DO YOU STOP TALKING TO ME IN 12 HOURS. Everyone just ghosts on me for no freaking reason. Its so dumb IM SO NICE TO PEOPLE I GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANT. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE THERE FOR ME NOONE EVER. Why do i feel pain when i smile. Why do i cut and then i smile. Why do i wanna die and see if theres light why do i wanna cry instead of continuing on h this fight. Whats it like to actually have someone in your arms. Im in virginia usa. Im a guy. Everytime i try to seek help all people do are like call these people thry will help. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT SUICIDE HOTLINE DOES? THEY TRACK UR NUMBER AND SEND POLICE TO YOUR HOUSE. THEN THEY PUT YOU THROUGH ALL THIS SHIT THAT THEN PUTS U IN FUCKING DEBT. How about instead of pushing someone off like that you freaking talk to them yourself. Im bleeding a fucking river here and legit if someone saw me bleedingto death in public theyd probably dial 911 on my phone and then walk away while i was laying there bleeding to death. Thats how fucked up people are. Legit noone out there who gives a fuck about me anymore, so why the hell not end it. I bet anyone who says im here for you will leave within 12 hours. So im not even guna bother. Ill be the one to leave within 12 hours this time"
Am I suicidal?,"Sorry if this is the wrong place, wrong topic, or wrong crowd. This is my first Reddit post I've ever made, and I'm just hoping to find a voice and some echoes back in the darkness. I don't actually post online in general, but I am aware of trigger warnings and how seriously people take them, so, uh, obviously trigger warning about suicidal thoughts, and also self-harm, and pretty much every kind of abuse.TL;DR: Long history of abuse, have never emotionally worked it out, doctor re-traumatized me very recently, this became an opportunity to connect with my therapist on a level where I could trust him enough to finally address old pain, until he realized he made a mistake, had to break my trust and do the one thing I was trying to avoid. Now I feel crushed and a sense of futility and am making stupid risky choices that could kill me, but not committing to a proper suicide plan. What's going on with me? Am I suicidal, or something else?TL:
I don't know if I am actually suicidal, crying for help, looking for attention, overreacting, or what. I cannot commit to fully going through with it, so I feel like I still have hope. I somehow always find hope. But I am also hurting so deeply and feel like it will never get better, and am starting to obsess about the release of death. I have a way planned out to do it, should I ever fully commit to it. It's one of those things that I do not want to mess up. And the way I have 'planned' out is simple, requires little preparation or supplies, is easily accessible, and is practically foolproof. Basically, I have no excuse not to do it 'right,' at any time of my choosing, if I actually choose to kill myself at all. But I'm not there yet.What I have been doing is going to sleep most nights on a handful of random prescription meds and some shots of tequila. It was mostly last week, and it was mostly combinations I felt very confident would cause me no long-term harm. Why do I mix them at all? I suppose it satisfies some burning need for self-destruction, especially lately since I have been hurting deeply.The thing is, there were at least two nights last week, and especially one, where I flat out took a couple combinations of medications that are known to be fatal. And I didn't just take the doses I was prescribed...I took double, or triple, or quadruple on some pills. Then I added a bunch more pills, just 'cause - especially if they had obvious warnings about interactions with alcohol. Then of course I took a few shots of tequila. Then I took more pills. I recall thinking to myself, 'well, this may ACTUALLY kill me this time. Hell, by all rights it probably will.' I had survived taking the base combination of meds before, but only at single doses of each, or double-dose at most. And that was back when I was taking a LOT of meds, and had quite the tolerance. And I'd never mixed them with some of the things I did this time, which only enhanced the danger and chances of dying. And I totally knew what I was doing, and that - not only was there a CHANCE I could die, but by that point, a likelihood. And I went to bed feeling great. Light. Peaceful. I guess in my mind, I saw it as all of the advantages of suicide, and all of the advantages of an accident, which sounds terrible but is what it is. Some stubborn part of me doesn't want to admit defeat and choose to kill myself. Some part of me doesn't want my friends, few though they are, to think I wanted to do that to them. Some part of me still has hope, but I don't know why because I seriously have every ounce of hope crushed in my life somehow. The rest of me is exhausted, and really really hurting, and tired of trying my hardest and being defeated at every step. And those parts of me figured this was great - I would go to bed feeling calm and peaceful and guilt-free, because I 'legitimately' (in my mind) was not TRYING to kill myself, and I wasn't sure if I was going to die, so I would either never wake up and never know any better, and all of my problems would be solved without any of the guilt or misery of 'real' suicide, and my friends could wonder what made me so airheaded that night that I OD'd, instead of what made me so miserable that night that night that I killed myself. Or, I would wake up, still be alive, and not be any worse off than I was the night before, and maybe even wake up with a newfound sense of appreciation for life. Spoiler alert: I lived, sans new appreciation for life.Now I am at a crossroads. I am out of all of the meds I used in the heavy-hitter nights, so I really don't think I have any meds I could take - even with alcohol - to accidentally kill me. But I'm still fantasizing about it, and obsessing about it. The more nights I go without some crazy OD, the more planning I do for my real life plans of suicide (updating my will, planning accommodations, etc). I suppose now is a good time to mention that I am taking antidepressants, and I regularly see a therapist. I really like my therapist, and I have been open with him so far about everything - even about the overdose of pills, even though I really didn't want to admit it. He's a good guy, and I have a lot of respect for him. There's just one problem right now...It starts with my doctor, who I am no longer seeing. The TL;DR on that is he screwed up big time, said things tailor-fit to fuck me up (eg suggestions that I was 'asking' for sexual abuse as a toddler, shouldn't legally pursue the people who gang-raped me when I was 12 because they probably thought they were doing me a favor, and concerns that I was delusional and imagining present day porn into my past...and it just goes on). And of course, despite outright telling him I did not want to have sexual contact with him, he came onto me. I was in the middle of trying to finalize a very tricky diagnosis, so I'll admit that I let that continue for weeks because I was too afraid to lose progress. The good news is after four years of fighting, I finally got a diagnosis. The bad news is I'm dying. Win some, lose some?I finally told my therapist about what was happening, under his word that it would remain in complete confidence and he would not have to report it. Telling him was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I can talk about my childhood trauma without batting an eye, but this was different. This made me feel vulnerable, and I took every ounce of trust and faith I had, and for the first time in my life, I allowed myself to put that in someone else's hands. It may seem like a minor thing to talk about, but for me, it was both symbolically and literally the hardest, most personal, scariest, and most meaningful thing I have ever told someone. It became the biggest weight I have ever felt lifted off of me. As we continued to talk about it, I found two things were happening:I was feeling a lot more confident, and my sense of self-worth was going back up. I started considering reporting my doctor because what he did was wrong, and I did not want others to get hurt.I was feeling much more connected to my therapist. Our confidence started opening emotional connections I've been lacking all my life, with others and within myself. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to make the connection I so desperately needed to finally confront the bigger stuff from my past, and also to finally have autonomy and feel empowered in standing up to an abusive situation (with my doctor) that had recurred all too many times in my life. It was a second chance to turn the fate of a recurring abusive scenario from my past around. so I was empowered, AND an opportunity to FINALLY, after decades of desperate soul-searching, tap into everything holding me back from confronting my demons and finally having closure in my life, especially before I die. That trust and that connection became the most precious, rare, and important thing I'd ever had in my life. I know that may sound pathetic to a lot of you, but understand that in my life, it is literally a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing.For the first time since my flashback and depression hit, I felt true hope, energy, and empowerment for my future, and for my future work. I'd never been able to have the kind of trust needed to delve into the emotions attached to my childhood trauma, but here it seemed to finally be developing all on its own. It was literally the first time in my life I felt like I stood a chance of tackling those issues - which is more important to me than ever, since I want to reclaim them as part of my life before I go, and frankly my time is ticking.I got the gut feeling that it was time to take action against my doctor. I marched into my therapist's office feeling strong. I knew it would suck, but I was ready to take it on, and it was my choice, and I knew he would be supportive. So, of course, before I said anything that day, he opened with an update that he had since realized he'd been wrong about the reporting requirements, that it was an honest oversight, that he'd tried everything he could to keep his end of the bargain, but that he had to break trust and was required to report the incident. To his credit, he was transparent about it, did everything he could to work around it, and then did everything he could to make sure it wouldn't happen to anyone else. To my credit, that doesn't make me hurt any less.I know it seems silly. You might say, 'well you were going to report him anyway, so what does it matter?' and I'd even be inclined to agree. I think what is killing me is, the issue of trust - it was really, REALLY hard for me to trust my therapist, and relying on that trust and telling him was the hardest thing I've had to do, and the most trust I had to extend, since I was a small child. It was really, really meaningful to me, so even symbolically, breaking that trust is heartbreaking. Secondly, his mandatory reporting takes away my autonomy. If I changed my mind and decided not to report it, for whatever reason, it would no longer be my choice. And finally, in a few words it erased that feeling of emotional connection and trust I finally had, for the first time in my life, to work on these horribly traumatic issues I've had bottled up since I was old enough to have memories. To lose that...there are no words.I don't know what to do. I'd like to think that we can work through this. I know he is genuinely remorseful, and that it was an honest mistake. But I also know he doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it is to me, or that it was opening up my trust to my bigger issues. In fact, he kept trying to convince me that my outburst of hurt and pain was really just a transference of the pain I was feeling from being traumatized by my doctor. That might have been one of the most hopeless feeling moments in my life.I don't want to see another therapist. I don't think a different therapist will be any better. If anything, I'll just lose the trust and work I've established with my current therapist. And the trust that we built is not something that can just come from talking to someone. I stand just as much a chance of getting it back from him as I do getting it in the first place with someone else - IF I ever get it again. But I'm in my 30s, and that is the first time IN. MY. LIFE. that I felt that opening up, despite years of therapy, positive attitudes, success with life, and all of the right circumstances to have tapped it before now. It was a miracle I had the chance to get there once, and that happened because of a freak trauma that I HOPE to not have to repeat with anyone else again. So, here I am. In the middle of the night, on Reddit, typing my first post, which is embarrasingly long (and this is the short version), looking at my bottle of tequila, knowing I have to go to work tomorrow and put my brain full-force into intense thinky work things, wanting nothing more than to feel the pleasant floaty buzz of a drink and a few muscle relaxants, and maybe not wake up, ever again, and not have to try to explain to my therapist again that, I'm sorry, even though you weren't the bad guy here, what you did is really the thing that is hurting me, and I don't know that I will ever recover, which means I don't know that I will ever go on to accomplish my goals before I die. And the more I keep trying and failing like I have the rest of my life, the more it's just going to feel painful and empty in the end. And it's a sobering thought.So then I soberly think about whether I'm ready to go through with my full-fledged suicide plan, or whether I'm willing to risk what is left of my hope (almost none) and my fighting spirit (all but burnt out) on some pipe dream of regaining this elusive sense of trust that only ever materialized from a traumatic anomaly, or whether I'm still stuck on tequila and prescription meds. And whether I'm suicidal at all.Thanks for listening, and for making it this far."
My soul has been destroyed,Perhaps it wasn't worth saving
"I'm giving up. I'm a terrible person who doesn't deserve a good life, or any life.","Here's what happened. Last year, I entered college as a freshmen. I was assigned a roommate, who was very creepy in how I would come home and he would be in my bed, claiming he was ""tired."" However, he was not the creep, I was.One time when we were sleeping, I was looking at pornography on my porn and slightly rubbing my penis on the mattress, I accidentally made myself climax. I felt terrible for what I did, especially being unsure if my roommate saw what was happening at the time. I have OCD, and I am currently getting treatment for it, but before I got treatment, I wanted to find out if he really saw me. So I planned to masturbate on multiple nights to see if he would say something or notice me (I would masturbate by quietly thrusting the mattress, with blankets covering me.On one night, when we were going to bed, he said ""I'm actually gonna go read for a while, good night."", and left. I was mortified because I didn't know if that meant that he knew what I was doing. When he got back, I masturbated again by quietly thrusting the mattress to see if he noticed.I'm going to kill myself because I feel terrible having to put him through that. I feel like a creep and a pervert and I don't deserve to live. He doesn't talk to me because I moved last October due to me not being comfortable with how he would be in my bed when I got home and him messing with my stuff. I don't know what to do anymore, I can't live with the guilt.  "
Give me one reason why,"Give me one reason I shouldn't do it. I have a good life, GF, big family, 80k a year job at 26, big circle of friends, and I just don't care. Like I literally don't care about anything. What's the point? I've already done the therapy and everything. No one can actually give me ONE reason why I shouldn't just off myself. I have what I need to get it done. I'm doing this to humor myself."
I'm getting out of here in 10 days.,"If anyone in the UK wants to join me PM me. I kind of wanna have sex before I go too but I guess thats not gonna happen. I am nothing therefore I will become nothing. Im not trying to trivialize anything, I am simply leaving. 21F, paranoid personality disorder, depression, agoraphobia, psychotic symptoms present. If I have offended anyone with this post then I'm sorry, I really am. I am dying soon so I don't have time to be careful. "
Was in a car crash yesterday. I wish I had died in it.,"I was the only one in the crash. It was an accident not intentional. Yet I got away with only cuts, bruises, and a sore neck. I wish it had killed me. Too bad the universe has too sick a sense of humor to allow it."
Nobody loves me and Nobody cares if I die :(,"My life is over. I always tried to be a good person as possible. But, It doesn't matter in this cruel world. I'm lonely, depressed and forgotten. If I die nobody will remember me. I have been thinking about suicide in the last few days and It's getting pretty serious."
I feel horribly depressed and it makes me feel like dying wouldn't be that big of a deal,"Sometimes I get horribly depressed but idk if it's actual depression because I was never properly diagnosed. It gets so bad to the point where I don't want to act on hurting myself but I think ""It wouldn't bother me if I just dropped dead."" During these depressive episodes I get an intense amount of self loathing and intrusive thoughts saying ""You're ugly"" or ""You're horrible at art."" Or ""The reason why you're like this is because you're an accident, your parents would be better without you and everyone secretly hates you"""
attempted suicide in paris last week,"everything still seems hopeless... I was supposed to go to law school, but now all my books are just reminders of my failed ambitions. I'm 26 and I feel like my life is already over. I am a failure. I am doomed to live a horrible life. I feel so alone.. "
Looking for a video,"Alright, I know my description is vague, but I was wondering if anyone here can link to this video? It's a good one that I think most people here will enjoy. Essentially the video is of a younger black male talking about either suicide or depression and how it takes strength to get through it. He may be reading a poem.Thank you."
"A no good, lonely wednesday","Hey. I'm having one of the worst days in a long time and my usual network of support is unavailable. Usually id text my brother and he'd reply with something interesting or funny, but we've had a fight and he left me in my existential dread. Now I can't stop drinking, smoking and imagining  ... My therapist is on vacation and I can't even bear the thought of looking for a new one. Would you kindly post something interesting/funny/kind to help me get through this shitty wednesday?"
I'm seriously thinking of killing myself,"I'm 15 and of course, I'm in high school. After failing a class my freshman year, I promised my mom I would not get a class that has a grade lower than a B. A month into school, my mom sees a C+ on my grade and a total of 7 missing assignments. Then she starts hurling hurtful words at me. pls help"
Suicidal thoughts out of boredom/dissatisfaction,"Lately I've been having intrusive thoughts due to an overall sense of being unsatisfied with life, even though from an outsider's perspective I have it pretty good. It's not a typical depressive spell I deal with, more like intense feelings of not feeling content and feeling tired of my current stage in life. Excitement about novelty wears off fast for me. This time though, it's turned dark. Talking to my therapist today about it. It's very irritating and makes me antsy, which is more concerning to me in terms of suicidality. "
I am planning my death,"I don't know exactly why I write it here, I don't really think I can get much help, but I just, I really want to tell someone about how I feel at the moment, and well, I guess here is my only place.So, basically, I am planning my death, I am planning when I want to die, how I want to die, thinking about how I make sure professionals will find my death body and not my family. I am thinking about how I should spend my last money and what I should leave for the funeral, I am thinking about getting rid of everything I don't want people to see about me, thinking about canceling everything in my life, before I actually cancel my life.In some sense I sort of want to live, but I just have to accept that, I really don't, like I kinda like somethings about life, somethings are okay, but it doesn't matter, because most of my life I don't feel any happiness at all, most of my life, most of my days I only feel lonely and sad about being lonely. I will soon turn 23, and I have, like nobody I speak with, I en general have no friends in my life. I sometimes have friends in a short period of time, but everytime I start to talk with people for a period of time they disappear. I must really be a horrible person, like really truly a worthless loser, and there is no reason I should stay alive. Like, I have thought alot about maybe I could just be happy alone, just be happy never speaking to people, but, I must accept, that, it will never happen, I can never be happy alone and isolated.At the moment I keep thinking about how insanely easy it will be to kill myself, like right now, I have all I need, I can screw all preparations, I can just go end it all, it's so easy, but probably also very very painful and unpleasant."
Done with life,Life is just getting me down. Existing is just about all I do. I don't have a job. I only have 2 grand and i live with my parents. I got my associate's degree in visual art and got into a good art school. I decided not to go because I started to feel like art school and art in general was not realistic and pursuing a degree in it felt like bullshit. So now I haven't made art or feel like it's even important. I'm confused as to why I ever thought it was a good idea. I just don't feel interested in it. So now I don't know what to do.  Suicide is always going through my head. I wake up irritated that I'm still alive. I've been in treatment recently for about 6 months for depression and nothing helps. I just don't find any joy in life. I don't know what I'm supposed to do I just don't give a fuck about anything and nothing appeals to me. I feel stupid and boring and confused as to who I really am because I don't enjoy anything. I'm Considering gambling to see if I can just hit it big
I'm a Waste of a Human,"I like to think that I have the most accurate evaluation of myself when I'm drunk. These days the only way I can feel emotion is when I'm drunk. This is due to my need to supress all emotion normally. I know it's not a good idea to drink while in this state but I need to keep up 'normality' in front of people by drinking socially. I don't want them knowing I'm suicidal.Anyway, I'm genuinely a terrible waste of time. I believe that I mean nothing to nobody. Which I know sounds a bit needy and pathetic, which it is (This is one of the reasons why I hate myself). I'm generally a closed person, which again I know this is unhelpful and not a good thing to be. However,  I'm in the belief that if I expose myself I'll face rejection and being a burden to people. Better to keep myself to myself.I REALLY NEED TO DIE. Not only am I a faggot, I'm also a lonely piece of shit. Hell, the dog doesn't even give a shit. I would keep faith if I thought the personality underneath all this self hatred was worth anything. Turns out I'm just a piece of shit to my core. Hopefully soon I'll be able to brutally mutilate myself, drink myself to death or down bleach soon. Make the world a better place. My mother didn't give birth so that my shitty ass could come out."
"Really, it was a complete joke I survived the car crash","I want to die. Plain and simple. I was in a car crash yesterday that was a complete accident. Today I went to the junkyard and saw how it almost killed me. The day of the crash, I rolled into a ditch due to the wet slippery road and struck a power pole at 45 mph. The trunk took a direct hit and was completely crushed. Had the pole hit the front row seats I would be dead. Easily. Yet here I am with only cuts and bruises. It's hilarious really. I crave death yet I wasn't even granted it in a car accident whereas thousands die every year from crashes. Guess life just isn't done tormenting me and making me suffer. It's as if I'm unable to die. In a person that doesn't want to live it's a complete joke."
Another whiny straight white man,"Hey Reddit,I feel like I just screwed up my long distance relationship. Long story short, my gf told me that she kissed someone else in her country. I responded by confessing that I had been hooking up with my ex while my current gf and I were dating, but before we became ""official""/exclusive. Now it appears that she's blocked me on the app we use to communicate with usually, and I'm afraid that she's going to hook up with someone else and/or break up with me and/or not even speak to me again. I know other people on this subject have real problems in their lives but I have struggled with depression for the past 9 years (I'm 25) and now that this has happened with my gf I'm feeling a whole different type of emptiness and I'm actually afraid that I'll act on it. It's the newness of the bleakness that has got me worried, and those familiar spiraling thoughts are nowhere to be seen, all I can see in my mind's eye is nothing. I don't want to be at my (crappy) job anymore. I don't want to go home tonight and sit down for dinner with my family and pretend like I am feeling something other than nothing. I don't want to close my eyes just to open  them again and still be living."
Some days I feel like the biggest c**t in the world,My friend's dog died a week ago and I just found out about it 2 days ago. I wanted to comfort her because she's always there for me but all I did was remind her. Now I feel like shit because I made her feel like shit and she's not talking to me and she's my only friend because everyone else ghosted and one might have even killed herself because I wasn't there for her and I swallowed pills and now I'm just waiting for them to take effect
I'm ending it tomorrow. Should I leave a note?,"Nobody is going to talk me out of it. My plan is ready and i'm finally sure it's happening. It's actually left me feeling peaceful knowing it's going to be over. The only other thing on my mind right now is knowing how it's going to absolutely destroy my family. I know it's a selfish decision but I can't stand to go on any longer. Should I leave a note or is it better to let them imagine and  deal with it themselves? I don't even know how i'd write a note, I can't even put into words how I feel other than knowing it has to end."
"Thinking about it, ALOT.","so, ever since my brother moved out i've been stuck here. im 29, no job, no money, no nothing. stuck at home, can't get a job because i can't go anywhere because i have no car and live miles from anything. every day i wake up and think ""is today the day?"" and ever night before i fall asleep (when i can sleep) i wonder why i didn't do it. i'm 50/50 on wanting to do but not wanting to destroy my mom by doing it. she would never be the same if i did. but at the same time i can't take it anymore. my brother was always kind of my best friend, now he won't even pick up the fucking phone when i call him literally seconds after getting a text from him (just happened as i was typing this) so he definitely has the phone in his hand still. i'm not even going to tell him about if he wants to be so selfish.  fuck this, typing it out just makes me want to do it more. i think i want to do it tomorrow. i already have everything i need, and i have options. i could go with drugs, a gun, hanging, whatever i just don't fucking care anymore.

I can't shut it off. It's suffocating me to the point where I am convinced I should kill myself. I've been trying not to self harm, drink, or take drugs but its getting harder.

Veins,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety the majority of my adolescent life. That being said, I'm no stranger to the temptations of suicide. I attempted suicide once, back in highschool, but I have always had an issue with self-harm. I gave my life to God after my suicide attempt, and that seemed to alleviate the pain for a season, and I sobered up (in reference to cutting) for nearly three years afterwards. Now, I'm nearly 21 and almost a divorcee. Some days I'm fine. Other days, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. The love of my life, my best friend of six years who helped me through my depression and brought me to God, decided that I wasn't good enough for him anymore. He cheated on me, God only knows how many times with different people, and is now happy in a new relationship. I feel like I'm starting the grieving process all over again. I was happy with starting anew, in acceptance that my marriage was over. Now I alternate between the stages: Some days I'm angry and bitter and seek revenge. Some days I come home from work and just go straight to bed because if one more person asks me if I'm ok, I'm just going to lose it. And some days (I prefer these days), I get all glammed up and uphold a ""too hot for you"" attitude. Sadly, those days are few and far between. I've become increasingly aware of how prominent the veins in my arm are. They are tiny, but the blue/purple tinge provides a nice contrast to my porcelain ""Casper The Friendly Ghost"" arms. I often fantasize about coming home from a long, hard day at work, running a nice, warm bathtub of water, and slitting them open, leaving my roommates to find me. I know that sounds disturbing, and probably selfish, but all I've done is act selflessly only to be screwed over and abandoned. Sometimes, the only thing stopping me is knowing that my husky relies on me and that if I died, he'd be sent to live with my ex where he'd be neglected. "
"Killed myself in a dream, it felt peaceful","I killed myself in a dream and after waking up, instead of being alarmed or scared, I actually felt peaceful. Been contemplating suicide for awhile now, I have PTSD and depression. And I've been trying to stay alive through  crowdsourcing my my passion, just to see if it works out for me and for the people I care for. But if it doesn't work out for me, I might have to just end it. I actually felt depressed when I access it everyday and still nobody appreciates what you do, even if it's not that huge, as long as you're putting your efforts into it ��I just don't see the purpose of living if you're not doing the thing you love and living with PTSD is really not fun. It can haunt you anytime and anywhere. And sometimes I don't think I can deal with it anymore, where I have to hide myself from everyone else and pretend that you're fine when you're actually not. Where depression and PTSD is not talked about and people think that you're just over-dramatic person. I've told my parents about this before, and now, they act like it didn't happen and sometimes make jokes about the issue im facing. ��Everytime I feel depressed, sometimes I would do something that I know is bad for me like mixing alcohol and other stuff, or taking a lot of meds than I should have, just sleep off the pain, or when I'm too scared, I just cry myself to sleep. So maybe, maybe if I do kill myself, would it still be as peaceful? And will I feel satisfaction as I did on my dream? "

"in and out of crisis, trying this","Hi ,
I was in crisis mode last night, and suicidal ideation, planning and attempts are a pretty regular part of my life. I've never used a chat, hotline or anything before so while I feel a little better today I'm seeing how this goes (I hope that's ok). I had a tough session in therapy yesterday and am experiencing many rapid swings in state.
Emergency services where I am are retraumatizing and not welcome right now. I am on meds just processing a lot of feels right now."
I really want out of my country :(,"Hi, what's wrong?"
My life is over.,I went to the counselor. And I told them something I shouldnt have. My counselor reported it. Now my family is gonna be ruined. My family is the last thing I had. The guilt and anxiety is unbearable. Im destined to be alone with my thoughts. I shouldnt have messed with destiny.
I've been thinking about dying lately.,I'm not going to try. I've just been thinking. I told one of my coworkers and he laughed at me. I'm not going to tell my boss because everyone here jokes about it but im the only one that doesn't think this is funny.
"I'm feeling very low, and I don't know how it happened.","I don't know if it just crept up on me, or if it just came out of nowhere, but I'm feeling very, very low today and am having suicidal thoughts for the first time since my last hospitalization in June. I had electroconvulsive therapy done 16 times (I think?), and I felt fine I thought until today, and now I just can't seem to shake the thoughts. I don't know who to talk to about it because the last person who I deemed my ""best friend"" called me selfish and eventually left my life recently saying that she wasn't a therapist, so I don't want to push anybody away again. I've told my girlfriend that I'm very sad today, but she doesn't know the extent of it. I'm going to the counseling services at my university tomorrow to talk to them, and I'm hoping they can't/won't hospitalize me. I need to cry but can't, and I just feel awful."
I've decided I'm ready to go :(,"I get my one-month refill of generic Ativan (Lorazepam?) tomorrow. It's 90 1-mg pills.

I'll get my refill tomorrow, wait till everyone is asleep, and hope I'll be gone by morning.:("
"I have an incurable genetic condition, trimethylaminuria, and I would like to end my life on or before October 1st.","I'll preface this by saying that I'm educated, accomplished, and I have a lot of big goals I'd like to achieve. Like many other young women, I'd love to be married, have children, build a lovely career, and more. Unfortunately, I have a horrible genetic condition called trimethylaminuria that has prevented me from going to medical school, participating in certain lab science classes when I was an undergrad, being able to get any kind of non-online job, or even build my own business in a sustainable way. I have been mostly dependent on my parents for the better part of the three years since graduating from college, and this is not due to laziness. I managed to get recruited into an investment bank based on my grades, but my prospects lessened greatly when I went in for the superday interview and stunk up the entire room. I had similar issues when going to multiple temp offices and applying to a variety of banks for free internship positions--just about everyone had to politely (and understandably!) reject me. Now, to be clear, I completely empathize with others. So much so that despite doing the diet for the last five years, taking every damn supplement recommended by everything in the medical literature, doing TMAU research for my master's thesis, and spending over $95,000 of my own money on a variety of surgeons, dentists, and doctors, I am done. How can I have a normal life when despite showering, bathing, and having a good attitude about life, there are flies following me everywhere? I recently got off a plane from LA heading to Boston (where I live) and at least 2-3 flies followed me the entire way, including at the connecting flight stop in Chicago. How horrifying is that? Now, to be fair, there is a lower amount of smelly smelliness smellygrossness when I'm on certain antibiotics, but because of overusing them last year, I am now resistant to the majority.My issue is so different from those who just have depression. Those people can turn their lives around with antidepressants and a bit of hope. My issue isn't just a quick antidepressant fix. When on ANY medication, including antidepressant Prozac, people with my condition smell  even if they are also doing the diet and taking other steps to try to improve their lot in life. No matter how hard I try to just be the best I can be academically, professionally, and extracurricularly, anyone who even meets me for one minute in person will notice the smell. It's horrible, not just for me who has to suffer the humiliation, but for others. I know people often say that their suffering is bad, but come on, imagine how uncomfortable the many people who have to sit next to me, or breathe around me must feel. I mean, think about it, no matter how pretty a girl is, or how nice of a wife she'd make, who would want to have to marry someone who smells so bad? The smell gets awful, like auditorium-filling awful, around my period--it's like tuna and feces all rolled into one. People around me on planes and elsewhere have had to stick tissues in their noses to survive. That's how awful it is, and believe me, I'm very appearance and hygiene oriented.Why should I work a job below my intelligence collecting fish or being a garbage woman? Why should I have to live this kind of life? It's not like I can just change the condition. Learning to computer program would require at least 6-7 months of solid study, and during that time, I would have to be housebound like usual because I have no other way of interacting with people without the flies and smell being a major issue.I'm still looking into methods, because gas masks are so expensive and I'm scared of hanging. I don't truly want to die, but I bother so many people just by being around them, that I honestly see no other solution. I'll never have a normal social life or family life! I'll never be in the field I want to be in! The one positive point about me dying in a few weeks is that I'm leaving what I do have to charity, which is very important to me. Furthermore, my Mom has repeatedly encouraged me to kill myself for not going to medical school (she doesn't understand I have TMAU because she's a genetic carrier and cannot smell me the way others smell me), so I don't think she'll be that bothered about me dying. I'm estranged from the rest of my family, and only on small speaking terms with my brother and uncle; I also only have two female friends both of whom I communicate solely online and over email. I had an ex-fiance but I left him because he was abusive, constantly cheating on me, and was only dating me to get a green card; I think he's now married to the girl with whom he was chasing while we were engaged but I don't know for sure nor do I care. So, at this point, I don't really see how that many people would be affected in any kind of bad way. I mean, I honestly think that I've done my absolute best to make the best of this condition. I've tried all the medications, supplements, diet alterations, positive mindfulness tips, antidepressants, career changing ideas, work from home ideas, family support ideas, genetic testing, and much, much more, all to no avail. I'm sick of this. I have flies around me even when I take a shower with pH balanced soap. I have them around me when I take a walk. I have three insect zappers in my apartment and put on a ton of citronella on my body, and they're still around. I can't do this anymore, people. It's so exhausting having to alter menus at restaurants, deal with contempt everywhere I go, tolerate passive aggressive insults about fish, tuna, pooping my pants, etc. I even get disrespected by doctors, including my Dad who is a doctor. I had to resort to ordering neomycin and metronidazole from the internet because no doctor could diagnose the condition--only an organic chemist named Dr. Preti could. Worst of all, the odor fluctuates so I never know when it's happening. I could have 5 hours of happiness and be odor free before 20 minutes of the worst smell in the entire world that is career ruining.I just want to finish what's left of my work/legacy and then call it a day/life. This is a permanent solution to a permanent problem, which is why I'm hoping to do it at Dignitas."
Peace tonight,"So I'm killing myslef tonight, my life's always been mundane nothing exciting. I did to many drugs in high school and now that I'm out life just isn't fun. I have friends and family who will miss me but I've caused so much pain for them that it will be better if I'm gone. I'm actually very excited to see what's after death. It's kind of like a mystery I've always wanted to know and now I finally will know. if I meet god, I'm going to give him the biggest fucking middle finger ever. "
Is anyone else scared of going to hell ?,If they were to commit suicide ?
That crushing feeling you get when you realize it's never going to get better,"I'm stuck in a position I never asked to be in, due to my mother's mistakes and self destructive behavior. I've tried to help but no longer feel I can. I have come to the point where I realize I can't help her it's never going to get better. Jumping off Fremont is probably the only logical choice I have left. I can't do this I'm only seeing myself up for failure by trying to bail out a sinking ship that my mother continues to drill holes in."
"I feel sick, dealt the bad cards, can't feel happy, no job security, no future.","I'm a 23/M and have wasted most of my life drinking and smoking weed. I was a very creative, social kid growing up.

I've thought about suicide every few minutes for 3 days. I don't want to leave my family behind but I feel like I'm just rotting away.My brother is the best person I know, he's quite a bit shorter than the average person and hasn't had success with women because of it.

Something that makes me suicidal is a man can be a 9/10 personality, hobbies, financially, ambitoin wise and still get ignored by 90% of women due to height... in a world begging for acceptance and love for everyone, shorter men are still the laughing stock. That sickening reality alone makes me want to end it all, I can't bare to watch this sweet guy keep getting kicked back at every effort, and I see it hurt him.I'm know he will find someone, I just wish the issue of heightism was brough up once in a while. No matter how liberated a women is she needs her taller man to feel protected. I get it, it makes sense, it just destroys the hearts/minds of a whole demographic and no one cares.I have no qualification/degrees. I have lost ambition to persue a career and have accepted I'll be doing labour/factory work for my life - I could've done more, I want to snap into gear and take life by the horns but I feel so sick. I wish I could find a place where women liked shorter men so I good hook my brother up. I would trade a limb for him to be half a foot bigger. I know it sounds selfish to focus on my bros height, but if you saw it form where I stood, he has been disrespected/overlooked/unacknowledged in the past due to my height. The women who don't give him a second chance and make light that it's because of his height ""You'd be such a good bf, just too short for me :/""  - I hate them. Nobody tells a woman ""You're too fat for me"" yet it's the exact same thing.  "
"My mother walked in, while I had a gun to my head...","She just yelled at me for drinking, and then she yelled at me for apparently scuffing my brother's gun before he got a chance to use it. I mean, it's not like I was seeking attention or anything, but it would have been nice if she at least acknowledged that I was seconds away from splattering my brains against the garage wall, and maybe not berate me for wanting to. Especially since a lot of my distress lately stems from her denying that the difficulties I've been dealing with lately are legitimate. Sorry, I'm just venting. I have to tell somebody how shitty I feel. And this whole thing just proves to me that nobody would care if I'm gone..."
How I survived.,"This is my story about depression and the struggles. Post will be long so bare with me.Hi, I'm redditor, 23 years old male. I was born to low income family and my brother was handicapped. My parents were working 14 hour long days. Their old company had fallen over and the debt was huge. They were starting new company so they could pay the bills and provide us. We couldnt afford daycare or anything special and my brother needed to be taken care of, so I took care of him since I was 7 years old. I rarely saw my parents and they were working most of the weekends as well. I didn't have any spare time because the situation of my brother and someone had to take care of the house. I did all groceries and house chores, including cooking and cleaning. Walked my brother to the school for disabled kids and picked him up as well. Just to make it clear my parents didn't ask me to any of this, I did this cause no one else could. Because all the efforts me and my parents made in the next 7 years, the firm turned out to be success. We had enough money to move to a better place, we got new car and all that. I got my own PC and everything seemed to turn out well.I was 14 when we moved to new town. It was a small place with only 8000 people living there. First couple weeks went ok, untill the older kids started to bully my brother. And not like teasing, but beating him and telling him awful things like to kill himself and all that. I stood besides him and tried to make it stop, but it only ended me being bullied as well. It was now just me and my brother in the school. I fell into deep depression, which I still suffer today, but I've learned to cope with it. I didn't have any real friends and since I actually had some spare times these days I started playing on my PC. I found this awesome group of people who I ended up spending all my free time with. School was hell, but when I was at home it all seemed to go away. Because I fell in love. There was this girl who was playing with us, and we started getting closer. We ended up talking late to the morning almost everyday. Eventually I had the balls to te tell her I want to be more than friends. And to my surprise, she felt the same way. Only problem was she was living like 150 km (100 miles) away from me. We used messenger and webcams, texting all days and after 10 months we had our first IRL date. After that date we would travel the distance every weekend to spend time together. We ended up doing this for about year untill we didnt want to travel the distance. Instead we managed to convince our parents that we could move together and we did.I had just started high school with my girlfriend and it went pretty well for couple of years. Im going to skip some details here cause this is turning out longer than I inteded. But long story short. Im falling deeper into depression, dreaming about suicide every single day and just trying to act like nothing is going on. I start to party and use lots of alcohol and drugs. Since we had our own place and we partied there 2-4 times every week with my new friends. I end up being alcoholic and drug addict who struggles with school. Im not happy anymore with anything and the acting is taking alot from me. I start thinking that I dont deserve this girl and end up leaving her. She refuses to leave and I just dont want to hurt her. I want to kill myself more than anything. I fuck her best friend so she would stop contacting me. I wanted her to hate me, so she wouldnt mourn after me when I would kill myself.I end up moving with my best friend who I had met during school. We take lots of drugs and just ""hang on"". After one fucked up trip LSD trip I end up wanting to live more. I end up meeting my new girlfriend, and the three of us start to hang out. We dates for like a year and I end up finding those two cheating behind my back. I was very high at the moment when I found out what was going on and end up cutting my wrists, just to piss them both of. I survived and cut my contacts to minimum with both of them. Was still living with my ""friend"" though. I leave for couple of months to travel because I want to kill myself. I end up living in my car and after couple of months I find this awesome girl who becomes my best friend. We ended up living together. Well we had sex and acted like a couple without being one. Hard to explain.And after all of this, I was 20. So much happens in the next 3 years but this thread is not about me. Its the story of how someone can survive, even against all the odds. After all this shit I have been through, I hope you manage to pull it through as well. Im not saying you might have it better or worse. All im saying, you can do it. I did it, so will you. And my secret to that? Enjoy and feel triumphant when ever you dont feel like shit. Because of that small thing, I have turned my life around.EDIT. Sorry for all the spelling. Not my native language and got a little bit emotional writing this down."
What is the point?,"I have no good friends, no job and I drop out of college this year. Never been in a relationship either. I'm just always looking a way out of human contact. Despite this, my life is not particularly bad. I have home and state supports me enough to live minimal life. I could still finish my degree or apply for jobs or at least train my skills as I have all the time in the world, but I just don't see why I would want to do that, if I can just sit home and do pointless stuff that keeps me somewhat happy and sane. This on the other hand has brought up another problem that has been in my mind for months that is, why I even continue living when there is no point in anything. What does it matter if I die today or live another 60 years accomplishing nothing? For the past week I have been thinking just ending it as the void just feels far more better option. Today I have spent entire day researching different suicide methods so I could just drift away.But... now I'm starting to feel that being somewhat content with this pointless stuff is actually preventing me from making the final decision and with the constant desire of dying, I'm now in some sort of middle ground where I can't kill myself but I can't live either. I just want a way out of this feeling."
"Complicated situation here, need help","So a close friend of mine has recently been feeling depressed and has told me and another friend that he nearly brought himself to committing suicide. He also has a collection of recently self inflicted burns and cuts.Me and a few of his friends have previously tried to help him via positive notes about him, which seemed to have a slightly positive impact. We are now considering going to talk to his family privately in order to see that they could help him, is this a good idea?"
My trail of bread crumbs,"I don't want to be aliveI'm so sorry for whatever it is that I've done in this life or my previous one. I tried so hard for so long, it's been nearly 4 years since I've had a friend, since I've had a mum... it's been 8 years of mental agony, of cutting my wrists and my thighs, of suicide plans and notes. 8 years of being alienated by my family and friends, of hating myself to my core.I wanted to be loved, I wanted to be cherished and adored, by friends, family, a lover. There's so many beautiful things in this world that I'm never going to be able to experience, when I see others I used to know doing everything I wish I could be doing, it pains me inside- every year alive is another year of pain and pointless trials and tribulations. Nobody thinks about me, oh her? Oh yeah, I kind of remember her, well... I don't remember her anymore.She had blonde hair, she used to wear red lipstick all the time, she was an artist and a good friend, she was kind, and she cried, a lot. Now she's empty, she's nothing anymore, she's a shell that holds only the echos of who she used to be, her hearts hollow and her mind is elsewhere. I've left a trail of all the pieces of my heart along the way, like a path of bread crumbs following the disintegration of my life, memories hold the pieces of my heart, I guess I didn't have as many pieces to give as normal people, all my happiness has been allocated already, there's no more life left for me to give. My heart aches at my thoughts and the smiles I used to give, I hope my ' heaven ' is just a play back of the handful of wonderful memories, the ones I replay like a worn out record in my mind when I feel empty. I can't believe I'm still here, I've been numb for so long, I wish I had someone who cares about me to tell this to, but I guess I have this place instead, hi... tonight I'm thinking about everyone who's left the earth by their own choice, I hope they're finally feeling better, I wish I was strong enough to stop my pain too."
"Studied hard for an engineering exam, thought i had it, totally failed it","What we did in class was NOT rappresentative of what was going to be at the exam. The professor even skipped parts of the program, there was stuff i had never seen asked that required knowledge way outside of this field. Yet, because i'm in an extremely competitive university, most of my classmates will probably pass and i'm going to look like a complete moron even though i busted my ass this whole summer to try to pass it. I can't deal with this anymore, i have gone trough this feeling too many times, i am panicking hard and i don't want to live anymore. We have no guns here, i'm considering just sticking a knife in my heart and be done"
"I often find myself wanting to commit suicide over seemingly trivial things, can anyone help me?","I don't know what to do at this point, the will to live is getting  weaker and weaker and I truly don't want to be on this planet anymore. The thing that I'm somewhat questioning is that it seems that there's always something minor that seems to set me off and brings me to having these sort of thoughts. I sent a really stupid message to this guy that I'm interested in romantically, and he hasn't responded due to the message being so fucking stupid and for a few days now I have honestly thought about killing myself, and when I look at the reasons why everything's leading back to this message. I went through a serious depression in my adolescence and ever since then I feel like my options in life has been severely limited. I just don't want to do it anymore and I don't see the point. It's all just so hopeless. "
Bedbugs FML,Think I might have just gotten myself evicted for reporting bedbugs.  Exterminator is going to bankrupt me. I should just dye the carpet red if I find a notice on my door after that.  Been through too much and if they evict me and my dad I'll just whack open my arms and start doing jumpingjacks.
Not wanting to be the boy who cried wolf,"That's what they all say when I tell them I'm having suicidal thoughts again: ""oh, you've been saying you're depressed for five years now! Do you ever lighten up? You're not actually going to do it, you haven't done it yet.And they're right. I feel like a coward and a liar for being here when I said wouldn't be dozens of times. For telling them I was feeling suicidal but not actually following through with my promises.People should follow through on things, you know? They should be dependable? How would you feel if your friend said he was going to skydive a hundred times and never actually did it? I feel guilty because I'm unable to do what I say I'm going to do. "
I don't even know.,"I wouldn't say I have depression. I think I have been sad for a long time but I do believe that if things turned out different, my outlook on life would also be different. I left high school feeling like I was on top of the world, I felt like I was part of a family that would stay with me forever. When I started college though, everything fell apart. I started developing a social anxiety. One of the main reasons college sucked was because I started dating this girl who took up all my time. She was very clingy and jealous and had depression and anxiety and would never let me go out ever, or she would have a panic attack which would lead me to stay. Everytime I would even mention breaking up with her she would say something about her depression and suicide, and it felt like there wasn't much I could do besides stay with her, you know. I felt trapped and I didn't know what to do. For months this would happen and soon led me to being isolated from people on my dorm floor and any types of friends. Any time she was gone, I would just stay in my room because my anxiety made it impossible for me to have the courage to go out and make friends. I soon dropped out of college, leading to a strained relationship with my parents that hasn't been fixed, and finally got the courage to break up with my gf, which soon led her to try and kill herself, which was the worst day of my life. I have always wanted to make people happy and to think that someone wanted to kill themself because of me really took a toll on me. I got into some fucked up thoughts, I kept thinking if I were not around people would be happier. Like maybe if I wasn't around, my gf would not have tried to kill herself, my mom would not be dissapointed in her college drop out son and every single time I messed up, especially when I messed up on the job waiting tables, I felt like all I did was make people lives' worst. I started drinking a lot more and started having many suicidal thoughts myself. Now I'm 20 years old who just moved to a new college trying to start over and forget my past. But the thing is, my past is something that will always be a part of me. My anxiety has worsen and I can't help but think that everyone hates me and thinks I'm a loser. I spend every night in my room watching youtube and will spend days at a time without saying a word. I'm just very unhappy right now and I feel like no one cares about me anymore. I don't why I decided to write this and I don't even know if it makes sense. But I guess I just need advice from anyone who has gone through something similar. I just want my life to go back to normal. I don't know if I posted this in the right subreddit, but there you go."
All alone,"I've thought about killing myself many times in the pat and once tried it but out of fear, didn't overdose as much as a fatal dose requires. I come from a family where I'm emotionally abused because it's the method of parenting known and I've had depression before. The last 3 years of my life were the best of my life but my parents forced my boyfriend and I into a situation where it led to him being unable to handle it and he broke up with me. I know I have no interest in being with anyone again and my dad has forced me into a career of his choice too. There's nothing that gives me hope that the future will be bright. I've wanted to leave home for years. It's almost harder to want death than it is to wish I was never born. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so alone with so many emotions and nothing to look forward too. "
I should've killed my self six years ago when I had the chance.,I regret not doing it now too.
This might be it,"I've been thinking about it for a while now.......maybe this weekend will be it. It's not like I have a horrble life. I have a decent job, a caring wife. But i just feel extremely unhappy and I've plagued by horrible thoughts of losing all My friends and family for months now. They came out of nowhere and it's all I seem to think about anymore.  My childhood was alright, aside from the yelling and threats from my dad. I've been seeing a therapist and psychologist and have been taking meds. But i just feel like I shouldn't be around anymore. I have about 50 pills of klonopin some lexapro, and a big bottle of whisky. Maybe hanging myself after taking it all will finish the job. I'm scared, but idk what else to do."
"I don't wanna die, I just wanna get close","I don't want to get super-personal, but I've been abused by people I loved in almost every other way besides sexual. I've been left by so many people who I loved: my dad and the friends I make every 2 years (I move a lot). I'm afraid that my only parent will leave me if I come out of the closet (she's very religious;believes it's a choice;voices dislike for a their ""lifestyle""). She also""doesn't ""believe in"" depression, which I speculate I have (haven't been diagnosed though). My siblings are so distant and care more about their friends than me.I think about what would happen if I attempted suicide sometimes and think about how everyone would act. I don't actually consider DOING it, but I think about it. Mom would actually recognize that who I love doesn't matter, my siblings would realize that they weren't acknowledging me. My dad would hear the news and realize he was a dick. Everyone would recognize I need love and give me so much of it too....what's wrong with me?"
Im going to swall a bottle of ibuprofen by dawn,I cant keep living like this. All i do is schoolwork. My parents are constantly pressuring me and all its done is make my life worse. I have nothing to live for. I meant swallow in the title by the way.
I wonder how long it'll take me,Until I end my miserable life. Things seem to be getting worse and I'm tired.

I can't go along with this anymore,"I'm in my Junior year of high school and I'm 16 years of age. I have never been a good student in school, I have something called a slow processing speed which basically means most of the time I'm behind my class. The part that really makes me upset is that I'm not dumb and I actually have a normal intelligence level but since I have this learning disability I fall behind and get poor grades (81% average to be exact) I've gotten special help. Before but when I do I just get bullied for it and feel even worse. I constantly think ""Why can't I just be normal and use my full potential"". I've been thinking a lot about suicide recently because this is the year that I have the SAT and I'm definitely going to have a hard time and I just feel like if I end it all now my family won't have to watch me fail in life."
girlfriend showed suicidal thoughts for the first time today,"Hi, i need help. We kinda had a fight today (actually she was just emotionally unstable) and she threw this info to me for the first time ever. After that, i started to think about the hints she gave me and felt stupid because i didnt catch. I told her to tell me everything she feels about it from now, and that all her fights are mine too. She also told me that sometimes she cuts herself in the shower, and this has been happening since shes a kid, and that the only reason she didnt killed herself yet, is because of me. Ive no idea of what i should do, and shes a very smart person so i dont think shes lying at anything because she knows i would find that."
Every time I tell someone my problems they stop talking to me.,"Friends, internet strangers, a freaking therapist gave up on me after I told her some of my problems. It just reinforces the idea my problems can never be fixed and I should just kill myself. I mean if this many people give up on me why shouldn't I give up on myself?"
"Does anyone else get worse and start ""going down the drain"" when their lives don't feel in their control?","I don't even know how in depth I should go. Straight out of high school I went to airframe and power plant school. I've known since the time I was 11 years old I wanted to work on airplanes. I am 4 1/2 years into the industry now. One of my most recent jobs I was laid off from, because of not having insurance my Adderall medication and anxiety meds were not taken properly after said lay off. I had initially got a new job but it was horrible. My lead was rude and mean and condescending. But I at least had that common feeling with all my coworkers who also hated the lead. I was only there three weeks when I got offered a better job and I jumped for it. It was a great opportunity huge pay raise better experience with a military contractor working on helicopters. At the main base my first few months there were great, I had fallen in love with avionics at my last job, and I'm literally doing only the aspects of work that I love the most. I started with other women there which was amazing because they were experienced helpful and kind. It was a good drive from where I live so I stayed at my boyfriends mothers house closer to the job.  Honestly living out of her extra room during the week and going home on weekends was wonderful. So much less stress and anxiety then when I lived at my parents house.Few weeks and now I think he is literally out to get me. I feel like every time he talks to me he's extremely rude and degrading. But he always responds in a way to where it can always be taken differently. I'm so frustrated and stressed out half the time I'm in tears. After calling and talking HQ about my struggle out here they apparently called him and I got scared. So I bought this recording device in my pocket so I can record our conversations and review them later to see if I really am taking them the wrong way. So far I've only recorded one conversation that is made me extremely mad at the time of the conversation. Yet, when I review it when I'm not upset, I feel like I'm completely irrational. I feel insane here living out of a hotel room that I get sinus migraines in. It does not help that I have no support from family or friends. I have one structure guy at work that's really decent and listens to me. But even the other female there around my age, just chalks my lead up to being a Spanish man. I am not prior military like a lot of these people and I know I would not be able to handle being in the military so maybe taking this job was a horrible idea.Now this lead has known from the beginning that my hotel room gives me horrible sinus migraines and I have Anxiety that I'm on medication for. So I woke up late today and tried to call. We do not have any type of sick line so you call your lead. So first I texted him. Didn't respond back and I didn't know if the text went through, so I called him real quick just to let them know that I am awake and I'm sorry I'm late I just feel horrible. He proceeds to lecture me about him being too busy to respond to texts.... well I don't want him to put me down as a no call no show and he's being a fucking ass about me calling in. So I take my time trying to feel better and go into work. 30 minutes after being there he gets all on me that I should've let them know when I got there and then if I feel that bad I should go to the doctor. I tried to explain to him the only reason I was there was because he sounded mad on the phone when I was attempting to call in. So then he goes over the policy and procedures about calling him which is exactly what I did. He is standing there telling me what will happen if I don't call in sick. Which made me feel even more like he was going to accuse me later of not calling him which is why I showed up to work in the fucking first place. Doesn't tell me you don't look good go back to the hotel. No he tells me I need to go see a doctor. I fucking hate going to the doctors, they never do anything for me they never help and I always get charged out the ass for shit they didn't do. He says I need to go to the doctor to make sure that it's not contagious before coming back to work. He knows what's making me sick, I know what's making me sick, everybody knows my hotel is making me sick. He says ""I'm not going to hold your hand and take you to the doctor"" from there I just fucking lost it. I didn't really listen to anything else he had to say and I just started putting my shit up. I called the main office as soon as I got back to the hotel. This is just my final straw but there has been so many incidences after work where he could've just said something simple, but instead chose to say things in a different way making them almost insulting. I feel like I'm on the brink of suicide here at this hotel with nobody to talk to or validate me. I know I have anxiety but it feels so crippling almost now. I mean if I died in my hotel room the lead probably wouldn't even care. He ask the girl I work with this morning if she knew where I was. She offered to call me he said that was not her job. She knew something was up because I'm never late and I usually tell people if I'm not gonna be there. So she called me multiple times and then snuck away to the hotel to bang on my door. Which is what finally woke me up I felt so horrible. So if it was the leads job only how many days would he wait? how long until they would open up that hotel room and find a dead body.  If I actually did kill myself. Oh wait he told me in one of his fucking lectures three days and he would call the company to fire me. They would probably cancel the hotel reservation and the hotel would find my dead body. I feel weak, isolated, and alone with a bottle of hydrocodon, buspirone, and Adderall in a dark moldy hotel room. I just keep on thinking if I can't emotionally handle this how can I be a parent one day? Do I need mental health? I never thought of myself as having depression but each week keeps on getting worse and worse for me mentally here in this hotel and I feel like I'm going down a drain. I am scared to go into work because he is going to get onto me about shit I can't control. Lecturing me on other people's mistakes. Every little thing has been a fight. I ask him if he needs anything before I leave and he flies off the handle saying he should not have to inspect my area for cleaning the end of the day. I didn't ask if I had permission to leave I was asking if you needed anything before I left. WTF! I have always ask my leads that in case they needed something at end of shift. Not him anymore. Just there's too many little things to even list them here. So I'm calling in tomorrow I'm going to call HQ again. Because my mental health is not good here. And it's destroying me and it makes me so sad to lose a job I loved so much because of one asshole but I can't keep on doing this. Once the thought of it all being better if I was dead hit I realized how bad it is here for me. I am so weak and stupid for letting this all get to me. "
What to do next...,"I'm 19 years old, I just graduated high school in the spring. I have struggled with depression on and off since 2010. But since spring of 2016 my life has been in a downward spiral. August 2016 I moved out of my parents house, two days before the start of my senior year of high school. I spent all of that school year commuting 1hr plus to school all the while working full time to pay for somewhere I could live. My grades suffered and when the time to apply to colleges came around I was left with one place that would take me, and it was the school I least wanted to attend. I sucked it up the rest of the school year and enrolled in summer courses at said college, but I never attended a single class. I just took advantage of the free counseling for students. The psychologist there diagnosed me with borderline personality and major depressive disorder. I came clean about the diagnosis to my parents, and asked for their help. I deferred my fall admission to the winter to take some time off and get right, but just this morning my parents with two police officers at their sides kicked me out based on fear that I was going to be violent. I have little money left because I spent it to enroll in summer classes, no job, no car, and no place to go. I tried to hang myself earlier today but I couldn't bring myself to fully commit. "
I just need advice. What would you do?,"I posted on  first I think it is also suitable here. I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I came here. I have been feeling really down and depressed lately and it feels like there is no hope. Another user posted  and that is exactly what I am going through and the reason behind my suicidal thoughts. The only exception is that my parents are somewhat understanding. I was so sure of leaving this world this month so I didn't go back to College this week because I feel too tired mentally plus I won't be here long so whats the point? Even if I don't kill myself I am not going to school because I feel too anxious and I don't have ability or motivation to study, go out or socialize. I know I will end up sitting alone not talking to anyone and too anxious to talk to people or make friends. I am not going through the anxiety and sadness that comes with going to school for another year. I was anxious all through out high school and didn't develop any social skills, no friends, hobbies so there is interesting nothing in my life to talk about. It is not just school, even work I feel the same so I quit my part time job too. If I just drop out I am going to be a drop out with no social life or a job."
I have 35 minutes,At exactly 8pm I'm going in the basement to hang myself.  My suicide letter is already written/printed and I'm in the process of clearing all storage mediums I have.Goodnight.
"I just had a ""Yep, I'm done here"" moment","Father has a brain tumor. Mother is dead. Brother is a schizo. Wife doesn't love me. No stable career. Getting older. Unhappy.I've always wanted to die, came close five years ago. Now I just had an epiphany. I'm just about done. I've been on fumes for five years now. Barely living.I feel like after you cross that hurdle of mentally killing your self, the act itself is not frightening. I sat down and envisioned a gun to my temple and pulled the trigger. It was incredibly easy. Anyone else feel that? Like, yea, we're just about done now."
Depression and negative thoughts...,"I don't know if it counts as I don't think about suicide in the way that I imagine most people do.. but nearly every day I'll be doing something simple like driving and just think to myself ""what if I just drove into that tree?"" Or I'll think ""today is the day, I'm going to crash and die today"" and then I safely make it to my destination. It's pretty much a daily occurrence. I often think about how my family will react when they hear news of my body being ejected from my car when it rolled over into a tree. If it'll make life easier or harder on them. I don't know if this actually counts as being suicidal because I don't think I have the willpower to actually take my own life. I'd probably fail at killing my self too. But it's something that's on my mind daily and I felt like sharing it. "
I can't stop thinking about it,"Every few minutes an image pops into my head of a new way to kill myself. I don't consciously think of it, they just appear. And they provide a warm comfort. Dammit I want to kill myself. I'm a coward, though. I'm a piece of shit idiot who will NEVER be good enough. I'm a fat ugly retard nobody loves. My boyfriend drunkenly tells me he has always be in love with his ""best friend"" and ever since then(nearly a year ago) I constantly think about how I dont measure up. I'M A STUPID FUCKING SHIT COMPARED TO SOMEONE SO FUCKING PERFECT. I HATE THAT I WILL NEVER BE AS PERFECT AS HER. He says to not worry but i fucking worry. Knoow why? Bc he yells AT ME when i tell him how i feel. Says I'm an immature bitch. So what if I am. I'm filled with self-loathing and have Borderline Personality Disorder. I CAN'T STOP IT. I HATE MYSELF. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF. I hate that I'm not that fucking Rachel bitch. I hate that I'm a fucking crazy bitch. I hate that I'm a coward and can't kill myself. I hate that I'm so goddamn pathetic that I'm like this. It's not just this. It's everything. EVERY FUCKING THING. My life is falling apart. And it's my own fault. I just...want to die. Maybe in death I'll be good enough. JUST FUCKING MAYBE. If I slashed my face to pieces I'd look better than I do now. SORRY I'M NOT THAT 'DEEP CUTE WONDERFUL' CHICK THAT MY BOYFRIEND ALWAYS WANTED. SORRY I'M SO FUCKING CRAZY. MAYBE IF I WAS GOOD ENOUGH I WOULDN'T BE PUT DOWN OR TAKEN ADVANTAGED OF BUT FUCK ME RIGHT? That's what I deserve. No. I deserve death. Thats all I deserve. I know that this will make me seem fucking insane. But dammit I need to get it out. I am going to kill myself soon anyway, wtf does it matter what is thought of me anymore. Soon...if I wasn't such a coward. Sorry everyone. "
Seriously considering killing myself Thursday,"After my roommate leaves, I can use her crossbow. I figure I can aim it at my own heart, right? I have nothing left to live for. There's nothing for me in this world. I don't think there ever was."
Man I'm Fucked Up,"I wish I was dead. I'm so, so fucked up. I just took an online screening for personality disorders and the results came as follows: There's a very high chance I have avoidant avoidant personality, borderline personality, and OCD. There's a high chance I'm paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, and narcissistic. I know what you're thinking; It's ridiculous of me to take an online screening this seriously. Go see a professional, for Christ's sake! But fuck that. I will see a professional. I'm so, so scared to find out all of the fucking shit that's wrong with me. All the shit I'm not even fucking aware of. I feel so fucked up and I don't see a point in going on. Idk why I keep choosing to exist instead of death. It certainly isn't for a good reason. I cannot accept myself. In fact, I'm worthy of hate. All I do is complain about my problems on reddit. I'm rude to and reject those who try to message me saying we can talk because I don't want to talk. But what makes me so special? What right do I have to be so arrogant as to say I'm all alone on this planet? God please kill me in my sleep. I'm a fucking unpleasant attention whore. "
I want to tell someone anonymously what has happened to me to make me want to kill myself.,If anyone will listen I will tell you everything. I'm so sad it physically hurts.
I'm just tired of being myself,"I'm tired of still struggling with my weight. I am very morbidly obese, like hitting the 500 lbs mark. It's the usual cycle of ""I feel bad so I eat which makes me feel worse so I eat etc..."" My weight has just climbed. I've used it to push people away, to bottle up my emotions. When I was 18 I was very close to killing myself but I didn't. Tonight I regret it because then all those years wouldn't have happened and I wouldn't have so much failure on my shoulders. I'm so ashamed of myself that I can't live. I push away my friends because I'm afraid to see that ""damn she's big"" expression on their face. I lost my job last year and I've been afraid to look for one because of how disgusting I look. I went to school to get a better career but my weight poses a serious roadblock. My mom gave me a box of chocolate donuts the other day and it really hurt me. It was a weird reaction I guess. I'm probably reading too much into it but I couldn't help but feel that she's given up on me. I'm fat and a failure so here's some donuts for you. I don't have anyone to dump this on so here I am on the internet to at least vent a bit. Everyone around me seems to have a healthy relationship with their own life, how can I poison it with my crap? Every night I hope my heart gives out and I just never wake up. Believe me, I lift out of my family's life so easily. They'll be sad for a bit but then there'll be a relief that the anchor around their neck is gone. One thing that scares me is surviving my attempt. It would be my luck to end up worse than ever. I have tried to lose weight. Sometimes I feel like a drug addict that's trying to resist their next fix but end up giving in. Why is it that good people die and pieces of shit like me get to live????? Sometimes I wish I'd get mugged so that the decision would be taken out of my hands. I'm so sick of myself and I don't know what to do! I need help to just get through a moment in my skin. I avoid a mirror as much as possible. My sister just had a baby, my first nephew. I envy his clean slate. I'm so twisted in my thinking that sometimes I wish that had been addicted to alcohol or drugs so then at least I would be thin. I'm ashamed sharing that thought it's so stupid. I really don't know why anyone should care but this is my message in a bottle, so to speak. I'm overwhelmed and I don't know what to do anymore. Dying seems the best fix for my utter failure as a daughter, sister, friend, student, contributor to this world."
Girlfriend needs space...i recentky had an attempt and im not scared to do it now.,"Girlfriend left me. Said she didnt think id change. That it was us that was the problem. I didnt want to lose her. Ive already been depressed. Ive had a rough life. But now im completely alone. I want her back. But i dont know if she will. I guess my question is,how can i change. She said im a miserable person. What can i do? What can i say? If i dont get her back then im gonna leave this world. She told me she still cared. But i dont. I attemoted a few weeks ago. I know its painless. Im not scared anymore. "
Escapism Extremist,"I've spent my life in a condition of acute darkness. To be exact; I'm not sure how I'm alive. I have an insatiable understanding that I am destined to perish. I was convinced that this now past summer would see the end of my life, but as it is now September, obviously I am at a loss. While I recognize my life can't come to an end without actively attempting to halt it, I have taken such a back seat role in my own existence that I feel like I have sunken beneath another realm. I do not feel in control of this reality and it is growing increasingly petrifying as time goes on.
 I'm 19 & feel as if I am a self-fulfilling prophecy. "
"Problems at home, it hurts.","Hi, my name is Scott and i'm 16 years old and today I had my first real thought about suicide. I live in a pretty wealthy family with a loving father. My mother on the other hand is a bit different. I'm not sure whether or not her love for me is real and I can't tell at this point. Whenever something bad happens it's always my fault and I get no say in the matter. I'm called worthless, a pile of shit, and given no food at points because she says ""oh yeah I have to feed you till you're 18, oh well."" She has threatened to kick me out  of the house numerous times and says when I turn 18 im never to live in the house again and I have to support myself and never ask her for anything. I just started my sophomore year and I've been doing decently well but I just bombed a chemistry test and my mom went at me for it. She tells me that she would rather give the money to another kid who wants to try when she KNOWS that I love school and want to do it. I'm a decently popular kid, I play lacrosse, i'm going to wrestle, and  have a good amount of friends. But after today, it feels like there is no future to me and that I don't see myself going anywhere, I just can't envision my self at all even if I try. I have 2 older sisters who are 27 and 30 and are both successful ( one is in medical school and the other is working for Deloitte). It feels like her expectations for me are based on what they did, and they were INCREDIBLY smart. I just don't know what to do and I really need help."
Is anyone just waiting?,This could mean waiting to see if things get better or waiting until your old enough to buy a gun. I just want to see if anyone else feels the same.
Homeless or dead?,"I don't know if I can make it past this month. The loss of my home is one thing. The loss of my pets is another. I just can't deal with it. I contribute nothing, I have nothing, I am nothing.
I'm ouqt of options."
Lost for years,"How am I supposed to do this. I stumbled across my ex profile and went through her pictures. I miss her and it's been about 4 years ish since we broke up. Shes living life right now. She's doing all kinds of shit. I know people say well you only show what you want to show, but it looks like there's so much more out there . I feel like shit. I don't do anything. Im a fat neet who sits home all day. No school or anything. I've been contemplating suicide for years now. But I don't know how to convince myself that my family will be okay. They put up with my neet shit and to off myself would be a giant fuck you. I don't know anymore . I have no friends or anything. Just music and Vidya. Even then they are degrading as time goes."
I just wanted someone to hear me,No one believes I'll do it. Last time he told me to drink bleach if I was serious. I found a better less violent way. No mess. I'll just fall right to sleep. Gnight.
Your experiences with suicide hotline,"do they send people to your location if you are suicidal, should you call multiple people if you are having an unhelpful person"
"Im 16 and i feel like no one loves me or has time for me, and i have nothing offer this world.","i feel like i have no potential, and im useless my parents never have time for me, and i dont have any real friends"
All my problems can be traced to me being a lazy piece of shit,"I'm a 16 year old in his junior year of high school. Academically I guess I would be considered at least an above average student- the majority of my classes are advance placement this year, and my GPA is well above a 4.0 (out of 5.0, I'm not sure if it works differently in other states for whatever reason). Socially, I think I'm pretty well liked. I have friends and sometimes I even hang around with a few outside of school. I have a parent who loves me and an older brother I adore, and I live in a household that could comfortable be considered as well off.So why do I feel like suicide is such an appealing option for me?School feels like a meaningless, stress filled slog at this point. Although it's early in the year, I'm already beginning to struggle in a few of my classes. I look ahead and my life looks murky and uncertain, and I barely have anything planned for college or any inkling that the future will be any less of a meaningless, stress filled slog. At best, I manage to distract myself for a few weeks before falling back into my usual mindset.I know that there's a lot of people who are dealing with what I'm dealing with, or even more. There's probably a couple hundred in my school alone, in fact. I look around and I see people excelling where I'm failing, comfortable where I'm stressed out. It makes me wonder where I'm so fucking inadequate compared to the rest that I apparently can't deal with the life problems of a goddamn highschooler. I've been doing my best to keep up with the schoolwork, spending a few hours every day diligently finishing the homework we're assigned, but now that Harvey has shut down the schools for a couple of weeks, I find myself procrastinating the shit out of anything productive I could possibly be doing. Now that I've been bumped out of the hectic rhythm of school, I can barely bring myself to study or practice for anything. It pisses off my parents, and it bugs me. It's just the latest example of where my problems wouldn't be there if I wasn't such a lazy piece of shit. I'm dreading when school starts up again so I have to play the game of ""desperately try to cover for your own inadequacies when you could avoid all of this by putting in the work in the first place"". Now I'm aware I haven't said anything that really sounds ""suicide worthy"". If anything I probably sound like a spoiled teen whining over insubstantial bullshit and failing to appreciate how good he's got it. Honestly, that's probably true. What makes this even more pathetic is that it's not like I feel like my life has hit rock bottom, or any of the usual reasons that one might consider killing themselves for.  Or maybe I'm wrong; some people consider killing themselves because their lives are unbearable. I guess my reasoning could be considered a really watered down version of that. I just really can't see myself going on like this.I don't really know if I've managed to properly convey how I'm feeling or if I've just typed some sort of vaguely depressed ramble. The reasons I haven't gone through with it yet are 1) I don't want to hurt my family and 2) I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself in a messy and painful way, and the other methods are out of reach from me as a teen. Really even seriously considering suicide is selfish and probably narrow-minded as fuck. That doesn't make me feel any better about it.TL;DR: Whiny teen can't deal with high school, and could probably solve all of his problems as well as improve his life in general if he'd stop being so fucking lazy."
"I want to commit suicide, but I'm too scared to do it","I'm 15, living with my parents and younger sister.Every day I feel worse regardless of what I do.As a hobby I play video games, so much. If anything, it's an addiction more than a hobby.I'll play mostly TF2, or some retro games from the gba-gcn era, usually replaying games like Zelda, metroid and Mario.Even though this is the only thing maintaining my sanity, I still feel worse after making no progress on something productive in the real world.I've been learning piano for around 5 years, 2 years ago I started grades and I'm at grade 5, I've lost the will to practice as I make no improvements no matter how long I spend revising pieces.I'm unattractive, by society's standards and very underweight.I lack any form of intelligence and my grades have been waning in recent years.Wherever I go I'm treated as though I am an invalid.My only options I have are to drown myself, slit my throat or stab myself, all of which I'm too afraid to actually do.I cut myself and drink heavily behind my parents' backs to not sate an alcohol addiction but to amend my misery and lust for pain.I despise the taste of the tonics I come across in the small cabinet in our dining room, yet I refuse to stop.I don't seek any kind of help, I'm long past that, I'm broken, if anything.With all of the past failed suicide attempts that I had chickened out of and my parents had come across, they have done nothing to prevent my eventual death or help me.How can surpass this fear and muster enough courage to end my sorry life?I'm begging you, I can hardly take it anymore."
Another goddamn day,I'm at my wits end. I'm not happy or sad anymore. I'm exclusively agitated at the fact that I'm always confused. I really don't want to live I shouldn't have to live this long why won't the meds work none of them fucking work
I just feel so alone,"I don't know, I feel so alone. I recently moved an hour away from where I used to live for the past 5 years of my life. I met so many amazing and influential people there and it broke me when I had to go. Now, I started my sophomore year in high school without everyone I love and I've never felt more upset and suicidal. I feel like there's a force inside my chest constantly pushing me down. Everyday, I've been feeling worse and worse.
I want to end my life, but I'm so scared to hurt the people that care about me. I do have a couple of friends who actually care but they live far away and I only see them on weekends. I know it sounds so stupid, but for someone who is an introvert and barely opens up to anyone, it was a very big deal to me because it takes so much energy to form new connections with people and I'm done with trying. I don't care anymore. I just want to die. That's all I want anymore. I just feel so sad and I don't want to see a therapist because they can't do anything. I don't know I'm just spouting random things at this point.
Sorry if this is hard to read, I suck at writing ripppp"
Lonely as fuck and I have nothing to offer. Inferior to other men and women. Why should I be alive?,"Just started my first semester at college and having absolutely no luck with women like always.  Still a kissless virgin and not meeting anyone it clicks with.  Got a Tinder for kicks and matched with almost nobody, DMs not going well...meanwhile I hear about girls who get 100+ matches easily.  I just don't see the point of life anymore and I want to fucking die because I know that no one will ever love me or even feel any kind of affection for me.  For every girl I like, I'm sure there are 10 hotter guys breathing down her neck.  I'm hopelessly outgunned and outmanned in every aspect of life.  I'm hideous, not particularly smart, not even good at any type of game or competition...my only skill is playing the saxophone but I got so fucking sick of it in high school that I almost stopped.  I don't see why I should live anymore when all I will do is fail and all I will be is inferior.  Want to kill myself but scared to die and scared it will be painful."
Why do they say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem?,"I have bipolar disorder and it can be very debilitating. Even on medicine I get into low moods where the only thing I can do is think about killing myself. I can't even get out of bed. It interferes with my professional life as I am a programmer and I need to be able to concentrate and think clearly, which is impossible during low periods. The medicine also messes with my cognitive ability.  I've been dealing with this for years. I'll live with this forever. This is a permanent problem. I feel like I need a permanent solution."
Hey :),"i'm useless. i hate myself and feel sorry for people who forced to talk with me. i want to end it all but i fucking can't. i am scared. i'm so fucking scared. the only reason i wanted to live and get better has left me and i can't bear it at all. i'm obsessed with her and i feel so pathetic about it. my hands have started to shake regularly and i don't know why. also heart hurts sometime. especially when i'm smoking. maybe i finally reached the point and cigarettes will finally kill me. idk. i can't live like that. i'm basically a dirty worm who's crawling around. but most than i hate myself... i hate you all. because you are all liars. every single piece of shit here who says ""i care"" is a liar. stop lying to others and first of all to yourself. you don't fucking care and you know it deep inside. that's the human nature. you know why you ""care""? because helping others makes you feel ""nice guy"". you wont help people if it's gonna hurt you in some way. i've seen so many people who ""cared"" and now i'm getting sick of it. each time i see ""i care"" or ""i'm here"" for you i want to fucking kill people who said that because it's a lie. who the fuck can you pretend? does giving false hope make you feel better? i swear to god i will end it all and no shit liar will be able to stop. all i want to do before i go is to keep promise i gave to someone i love. i will do it. and then i will leave everything i have to her and fucking shoot myself. even if she doesn't love me anymore idc. i'm not a liar and i'm not breaking promises. and i can't stop it. it's just who i am. you think i didn't try to find another girl and make my life better? i tried. i tried to change. but no matter what memories are able to stop me each time. and i can't take it anymore. i can't go on at all. i don't want to go on honestly. all my lifestory is a joke. big-big joke. and no one will even remember me hah.i don't even know what the hell am i talking about now. whatever. feel free to trashtalk or pretend! cheers!

I can't die until my grandparents are gone,"I've always been a nihilist and a cynic. But I would like some happiness for a couple years before I decide to end it. There's been a long line of tragedy in my family and I don't think I can allow my grandparents to experience that again while they're still alive. They raised me since I was born and I love them more than anything. They've lost so many loved ones including my uncle who I never had the honor of meeting. My aunts husband whom was an honorable man. Siblings, relatives, you name it. I think I changed after I became diabetic. I never treated my girlfriend the same ever again. I tried my best after getting back together with her but my moods were never the same. I became angry at the smallest things and I tried to fix that. But I got more complications with my oral health and my mental health and my relationship was never the same. I got cheated on and ghosted. She pretended nothing was going on as she spoke with me online. I knew she should never moved to another state but there was nothing I could do about it. I just want the rest of you to enjoy life. But be careful of who you trust. I saved her from suicidal thoughts and depression three years ago. But I think I'm on the same path now. I just wanted to hear her say respond to me. I tried messaging her and calling her all week to no avail. She was with him. I just can't believe she didn't treat me as a human being. After all we've been through. I just wanted to tell you how I was sorry for everything.I have an MRI scheduled but I don't think I'll have it checked. My sis is having a baby and that's what excites me the most. I've learned more in these last 2 years of my life than I ever could have dreamed of in my first 20. One thing I think I would regret is not doing things that make me happy before I go. I love spending time with my grandfather. I love him more than anyone on the planet. I've forgiven my mother for abandoning my family when I was born and I've been trying to limit my swearing. I never should have begun in the first place.If I had to impart any piece of wisdom to my brothers and sisters in the struggle, do things that make you happy, don't be filled with regret or anxiety. Regardless of when you want to go or how you want to go, I'm not here to change minds or have my mind changed. Surround yourself with the things you care about and the people you care about regardless of your final decision."
I nearly hung myself yesterday...,There is a random hook in my living room perfect if you wanna hang yourself. I bought the rope a few weeks back. Looked up how to tie a Hangman's Noose and attached it to the hook. I put the rope around my neck and sobbed like a baby. I can't do this much longer. It's getting worse.
I think I've decided...,"I think I'm gonna do it. On my birthday I'm gonna do it. It's in June so I have enough time to figure it out, but also enough time to pussy out if i'm gonna. maybe I'll be able to keep going on until then knowing I'm gonna do it later? maybe I'll end up doing it before then? idk i just know something's got to give soon"
they always say you should reach out to someone--but what if it that makes it worse?,"I've been suicidal for almost 10 years. Finally had the courage to tell my best friend. She was great for a day and now she's acting like I never told her. I can tell we're drifting apart because I'm having a hard time reaching out but every time I want to say something to her I just think ""the person you consider your best friend does not care that you want to kill yourself."" Of course I know that people will be sad after I die. But if they don't care that I'm alive, what's the point in holding out? And how am I supposed to trust anyone else enough to tell them? I get that it's a huge thing to drop on someone, but when I think about it from the other perspective, what I would do if she came to me, I can't imagine not checking up on someone who told me they want to kill themselves. Like all I would need is a simple text, a simple ""how are you?"" Especially when I know they're in an environment with many triggers to their depression and suicidal thoughts. I know people will say ""well they're not very good friends anyway."" But if I can't consider her my best friend, then I really don't think that life is worth living. I'm out of the country and away from my friends and I have plenty of methods at my disposal. I'm going to do it in a way that looks like an accident, because I know she'll feel bad if she knows it's a suicide. I don't want her to feel guilty because I still love her, even though she may not love me the same. "
"Well, I set a deadline again.","I'm going to try to fix my shit this semester, and if I can't that's it. I'm out of energy, I'm out of money, and I'm out of goodwill. People will miss me but they're going to have to fucking deal, because I will never be good enough for them anyway and I'm sick of being a burden on my parents. I feel as if I have no other path forward.I haven't decided on a location yet (I'd like to be far away from my parents), but I think I've figured out my method (which I will not discuss in accordance with Rule 1a)."
medical insurance and checking into a hospital.,"I really need to check myself into somewhere, because I don't want to live anymore. The suicide hotline is useless for me, etc etc. I know of three ways off the top of my head that I could kill myself right now. I've heard horror stories about how much a hospital stay costs. I was wondering; does having insurance help with that at all? or is it expensive regardless? I have Kaiser."
44 years old and I can't handle aging,"So I'm vain. I used to be very pretty and now I see my body changing and it depresses me so much. I don't have a job so it's not like I can make money to change my body back to its former glory. I could try exercising and dieting but again you need money to eat right. I do walk 8000 to 10000 steps a day but it hasn't done anything for my body. I've had a good life though. I opened a successful boutique which then went under due to long term street construction. I did well as a model and even as a vet assistant. I play violin and draw better than average but not so well that I can make a career out of my talents--believe me, I've tried. I can't hold down a vanilla job and have been fired so many times due to my lack of people skills. I really have a hard time with authority figures and corporate politics. I just can't play the game to get ahead. I've had so many traumatic jobs where my boss would either verbally or sexually harass me, or sabotage and steal my work. I'm just tired and I feel guilty for living and making my husband support me. I never chose to be born and I have no idea why I was even brought into this world. I've always felt bewildered by human beings and life in general. I just want to leave my aging physical body and not have to worry about superficial material things anymore. I can't stand the fact that I have to tolerate a job to make money to live out my days aging. I've tried so many diets and body hacks to change my body. Nothing works. In fact, any real hardcore exercise makes me gain weight because my adrenals are so worn out. I went temporarily blind on a raw vegan diet. I don't know how some women can stay so beautiful and young looking. Their techniques just don't work on me. Part of me wants to fight this voice that lulls me into committing suicide. Part of me says there are ways to change my body and that God wouldn't give me this body to hate it. There is a way for me to make some kind of supportive income so I don't have to rely on my husband. Hope is so seductive. Maybe I can find a way to fix this life and somehow enjoy it again. Wouldn't that be nice? Thanks for reading this. I appreciate your time. I hope you're not considering ending your physical existence. There must be a reason we are encouraged to live our lives out as fully as we can, there must be a reason why suffering happens. The tiredness has to stop because I choose to make it go away. Life really is dictated by our thoughts. So the more I wallow in this misery the more I create it. That's how it works and it sucks because it's really easy for me to just surrender to the misery and live in the pit. It feels so familiar to be miserable because I could blame my father for beating me as a kid. I could give into the misery of surviving several sexual assaults when I was a little girl. No one would question why I decided to end my life. I won't kill myself today because I decided to hang on to the hope that I can change my body for the better and find a way to make a decent income. It's out of curiosity to see how my life will turn out. I can always kill myself if it gets really bad. I always have that choice."
Really want to commit suicide but don't know how!,"Ok, as you can tell by my title I am struggling with life massively at the moment. I have literally nothing going for me, I have spent the last 4 years without any friends, girls despise me and I can't even look at a girl now without getting shot down, I haven't had a relationship in 5 years which just makes me lonely and depressed.I am a 19 year old guy who is on the verge of doing something I might regret. I am currently studying in a nautical college for the merchant navy, I am now about to drop out because I couldn't make friends down here and am struggling massively academically. I have already done a year at college and am on my second year. I have been bullied by a lot of different people at different times so I don't know anymore. I have been to a counsellor before but he made me worse, been to the doctors but they just refered me to a counsellor and won't give me any anti depressants.Sometimes I think why the hell was I even born when I could give my life to someone more deserving of it than me and who would enjoy it more I know I am different, got social anxiety, and a whole host of problems but I pity anyone who goes through this or worse, I cant describe how it feels!Anyway I wish I didn't care about anything as I really want to commit suicide but there are too many things stopping me. What happens if there is a hell which might be worse than earth, will it be painful, mess it will leave on my family, I could be unsuccessful and leave me like a vegetable which would make me hate life even more. I really just wish I could build up the courage to do itAnyway rant over there is a bunch of other problems I have which I haven't covered but I am too tired so just kept it short"
Inching Towards No Return,"Hello there,I hope everyone had a good Labor Day weekend.6 months ago I moved to a new state along with a new job. Since then, my depression has reached a new low. My job leaves me full of stress and I am constantly anxious. To the point where I can feel the stress flow throughout my body. I hate myself for not being strong enough to get out of this toxic situation. I am such a weak mentally willed individual that I collapse at the first sign of a challenge. I don't even know who I am anymore. Every day I fantasize a little more about ending everything. It brings me comfort, which scares me. I am not able to see a professional because I don't have the ability to take time off from work to get help. I feel so much internal pain and I can't believe how much I truly hate myself. "
I don't see a reason to live,"I'm sorry if this post gets a little messy, I don't feel great right now  I have a lot of problems in life, which I can't avoid due to being mentally and physically different (ill?), that alone makes it incredibly hard to go through school, as I get in trouble all the time and can't avoid it
I feel too much physical pain and can't do stuff in physical ed, nobody actually cares about that, all I hear is ""try to ignore the pain"" and stuff like that
Then I have problems with my friends all the time, I always try to help them whenever they have problems but always end up with them being angry at me
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with my friends, it's my fault
I seriously want to kill myself, but my friends are keeping me from doing it
But it only seems they care when I'm suicidal, out of that my friends don't see a problem with bullying me and doing bad stuff to me   I know some of my problems could be solved, but I'm also afraid of getting help, and even if I contacted someone I wouldn't know what to say to them to fix my problems
It's like, I don't want to fix my problems, I just want to die, or rather, not-exist"
Debating on ending it..,"I don't even know where to begin... i turned 22 on aug 20th.. I have a wife and 2 boys under the age 2, I love them to death and i don't want them to not have a daddy but im so close. I own a glock 32 pistol and i'm planning on using it but my wife has it the glovebox of our car.. she will not let me have it until she knows i'm feeling better.. So i'm planning to fake feeling better soon just to get the pistol then go far away from my house.. I suffer everyday but i kinda wanna hang in for a little bit longer but i dont know if i can. I don't know if its my medicine making me feel like this or not.. my doc upped my dose of prozac from 10mg to 20mg and instantly i feel suicidal for the past 2 days... i feel emotional numbness like i can't feel happy or really sad i feel nothing and my head feels foggy i don't feel like im here. The only thing keeping me is my little boys faces everytime i see them i start to cry cause i think about leaving them here alone with just there mom. My wife told me to come off the anti-depressants but there lies another problem i started them cause i feel anxiety and panic alot! i dont know if i have a depression cause what im feeling right now is depression.. i'd like to go back to when i was just taking 10mg of prozac for 4 weeks i felt better then when my doctor upped my dose...  my brain went fucking haywire.  I'm not decreasing my dosage at all im quiting this shit im tired of it "
I want to kill myself but I'm here...,"I have an apartment that only costs 120 $ monthly but I can't afford it. I starve daily, work a job 12+ hours. Was kicked out of older jobs because I'm 17. Now I just work in a cafe. I'm sick of life. Have no family. No dad. My friends think they should help with money but I reject. I am tired. I am sick of life. BUT IM AFRAID TO DIE. IM HOPING THERES ANOTHER WAY. IF THERES ANYONE OUT THERE PLEASE TELL ME IF THERE IS A WAY. I am desperately asking for something I can't find. All my skills are useless where I live. "
My fourth day at university.....,"And everybody has easily found atleast 2 to 3 friends, whereas I am isolated and lonely. There is no end to my suffering. I wish I could kill myself. I feel broken and lost."
MTHFR,"Deplin has started to wear off.  No more magic bullet for my broken krebs cycle.  Norepinephrine (""fight or flight neurotransmitter"") has far too much influence over how I present myself to others.  And I'm getting tunnel vision of the worst sort.About to go to a job fair tomorrow.  The collective voice of everyone in the room will agree on one thing:I'm not considering suicide in the sense of physical death, just the solitary outcome of being alive with shit genetics:  ""reputational death.""If you have nothing to offer anyone, count yourself lucky.
An enterprise that has not been attempted cannot fail.
A loan that has not been withdrawn cannot be owed.
A reputation that has not been born cannot die.
Yet here I dwell in this tunnel."
Just another drifter,"I don�۪t know what the point of this message is if I am telling the truth.  I have quote the American dream. House, spouse, 2 kids, a job and a fish. I consider killing myself daily. I also find a thread to talk myself out of it. I feel alone. There is no one there.  No one to talk too. I have to carry the world and if I misstep then it is others who take the pain.  My wife tries to help, be there, be understanding. I just don�۪t know how to relay to her what is broken in me.  I changed jobs the feelings are worse now I feel worthless in the professional side of it too. It wasn�۪t always this way. I used to be able to sleep more than an hour or two at a time.  I used to be able to turn off my inner monologue. Now I just feel it screaming at me all the time.  I�۪ve got two small children that need everything.  They are the reason I stop. Even this morning the voice of doubt is in my head but the thought of my wife explaining it to my kids pulled me back. I used to think I could take on the world now I have to pep talk myself to get out of bed.  It�۪s pathetic. Part of me thinks maybe it is CTE. I played enough to allow for that to be a possibility but in the end it it is just me. I don�۪t want to be here, the world wouldn�۪t care if I wasn�۪t(not that it should) and I keep fighting because I don�۪t want to hurt my kids.  Though the other part of mind tells me probably correctly waiting is not doing them any favors. Get it over with and let them forget and heal"
This point of no return,"I just refused my new job and someone replaced me.I have food only for 7 more days before I start starving.Suicide by starvation is acceptable in hinduism so I'm gonna do it.There is nothing that can ""save"" me now.And since it is not a violent method no one can send me to hospital.My leg hurts really bad when I walk so I can't work even if I wanted to.My future is 100% dead."
I should put a bullet through my head.,I should put a bullet through my head I should kill myself I should put a bullet through my head I should kill myself I should put a bullet through my head I should kill myself I should kill myself.
Right now I have pills laid out,I think I want to kill myself now. Every week I keep pushing it but the days get worse and worse. My parents and friends haven't been able to understand when I tell them I need help so I might as well end it all and have them never worry (if they did) again. I figured I'd want to talk to someone before I go.
Really need someone to give me a positive outcome,"Throwaway account because people know my real one.I'm done, I just started a college course that tbh I enjoy but after that, there's just nothing. I've started college while all my friends are staying for sixth form but I feel like i'll enjoy the course so that's the present. At high school we used to play together but then I stopped due to GCSE's and my friends all ditched me since I was no longer good at the game we played and I don't find it enjoyable by myself so I stopped playing.There was also a point when I was playing with my friends and I had suicidal thoughts, one of my friends was just bullying me and no one would help or tell him to stop, finally one day I told one of my friends and he actually was really supportive and talked me out of it. We had a 2 or 3 hour chat about how to fix this and he even told me about this sub-reddit, so to him I just want to say thanks for helping me get this far, anyway. I went to another game but played it through a 3rd party site. At high school this got me through the days, knowing I could come home and forget about all the shit and just relax, but today I was banned from it without even breaking a rule. I asked the guy that runs the site and he simply laughed at me shared it publicly and then deleted all the messages when I again asked if he could show me what rule I broke. Now after college I do football but the managers son started this whole thing. I do not want to go to training or matches since I honestly think I will break his leg if I get the chance. My parents are not easy to speak to, my dad constantly shouts and my mum is... shall we say not the brightest. I can't make new friends at college because I always somehow fuck it up by being socially awkward. All my friends that I played the 3rd party site with just ditched me since they are scared of getting banned as well. Now it's all black, what do I do? I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but every time I thought of them I just thought, ""wait until you get home and you can just relax by playing on the 3rd party site"" but now, fuck everyone, non of my old friends will talk to me, I can't talk to my parents and I can't make new friends and I cannot even do the sports activity's I've been doing for years without getting worried that I'll kill the little shit.Sorry if it seems I'm being over-dramatic. I have spoken to some of the people I played the 3rd party site with and they say ""It's just a game"". To you maybe but not to me, it helped me get through the days, I could forget about everything (even if it was just for 2 hours or so). I try to talk myself out of it because I know it will haunt my parents forever but whenever I think about my whole f***ing life outside of college hours it just makes me want to do it and end it all.ALSO: If any of you think I'm overreacting that's your opinion and your entitled to it but the only way to get something positive out of this is by telling you all how I honestly feel."
Hospital didn't even try to help and just left me even more debt ridden. I feel like I'm out of options.,If anyone is willing to talk let me know. I have too much phone anxiety to call the hotline
"I wish I was dead, or never born.","Since I can remember I have always known that I don't belong, one of the first things I can clearly remember was my fathers hate of me, his anger that I was even a being. His disgusted looks at me made him harm me and witness the evils of a mans capabilities.I am free of his gaze and feel nothing for him, yet since I was 3 I have made many attempts and one of the first thoughts of any given day is that 'why am I still alive', and one of the last thoughts of any given day is 'I hope I don't wake up'.People around me know of part of my struggles and how I feel, but they see me wanting to commit suicide as a selfish act, like most people do, but to me what's selfish is wanting someone around, who is suffering and see no end to that suffering. I understand why people commit suicide and I don't think they are selfish, we all just want the pain to go away and for some the only way to do so is to commit suicide, what's selfish about that?I believe that I am here to suffer and endure. I am a witness to humanity and I've seen every facet of the evil in a person. Very rarely I see goodness and kindness, and even then I question if it's for selfish reasons.We are all selfish beings who want what we want, I hate that aspect of myself.My first attempt was at aged 3 (yes 3 you read correctly) I set alight my bed as I knew fire purged wrong's from the world. As the fire licked at my skin it did not burn, and simply was extinguished.Another attempt was around 12 when knowing how to tie knots and the tensile strength of the rope I used, I could achieve the goal of ending my suffering. A proper tight noose was tied and as I kicked the chair over the beam supporting my weight, the rope snapped as though someone swung a sword. the strands of rope were cleanly cut, yet what I witnessed was an impossibility just as I saw 9 years previous.A year or so later at aged 14 I was walking back from school, and there was a high walking bridge that went across a dual-carriageway, I stopped and knew it was time for me to try once more and so I stood over the railings and let go. The reason I am able to write about this today is because my foot was caught in the railing, leaving me hanging upside down like in the cartoons when a character is trapped by another. Managing to get myself up with the aid of another I simply limped home with a somewhat twisted ankle. I told the person that a bully had tried to throw me over.Other attempts have included poison's, stepping out in front of vehicles (yes this is a bad one but when your in that mindset you don't care) I have and never would attempt to jump in front of a train (that's just not right, having someone clean miles long tracks).It would appear that I am here for something, as every attempt I make is circumvented somehow.There is a lot I could write or say to my story but I guess I am still searching for a cure to my suffering and pain. I am in receipt of medical help and support though I feel that currently there is no new information that I don't already know, or could find for myself. A long and slow process I am sure. At 25 I feel as I always have; empty, alone and in pain."
How do you cope? I'm really scared for the future.,"19 years old and I can't see a future because I'm too mentally weak. After so many setbacks I feel like a complete failure. I can't decide on a career, which leaves me without purpose, so my life is pointless. I now also have financial stress because of student debt. My friends are so far ahead in life (socially, financially, academically) its discouraging. I'm ashamed and just wish I could drop dead. I know how this would happen with winter temperatures approaching... I can't cope much longer after years of these thoughts. Please tell me, is it worth it to keep going? "
I desperately need help,"So my mom has been addicted to opioids for years now. She went to rehab 4 or 5 years ago and only stayed for 5 days. Mind you that the rehab she went to had a rule that once you admit yourself in, youbuave to stay for 5 days. Once you stay 5 days, you can leave and discharge yourself when you want. Well,my mom didnt like being sober and left on the fifth day; so she didnt get the help she needed. Years have passed and she's still addicted to the opioids. She continually buys them off her friends and the street. Soon after, she began taking my dad's medication for his bipolar, anxiety, and depression. It got so bad to the point to where my mom would blow all her money on opioids and my dad would have to suffer because they couldnt buget their money as an adult unit to pay for my dad's meds. So he was off his meds for a while. She then began to take my 10 year old little sister's medication for her ADHD (Focalin) for a whole month. And my sister suffered from that. My relationship with my mom began to deteriorate very quickly as my dad became moody and emotional; as my mom was the bearer of bad news: that she wants to divorce my dad because she isn't in love with him anymore. Not to mention that she tells my friends at work (we work for the same company) that she thinks that I hate her and that ""It's hard to be married to someone with bipolar"". There are very many little factors that go along with this story, but I am just absolutely depressed over this. Might I add that I have stopped my father from committing suicide several times over this and my mom is  to kill herself because she has been taking such high doses of different opioids. I am scared for both of them. I love them both dearly and I would hate for anything to happen. But this is totally out of control. I am nothing but a 16 year old girl with no power over anything.  of the hardest things that I know will happen is that Im going to have to move with my dad to Texas because that's where his mom and brother lives, and I'll have to leave everything behind...
Everything I've ever known...in this small town of White House, Tennessee.  I'm going to miss everyone and everything...
My best friend the most...he's always been there for me. He's my soulmate. I'm going to feel incomplete without him. Im depressed. Im hurting. Everything is crashing all around my feet. I feel alone. I have no help. No one to tell this to. Im on the verge of killing myself. I dont know what to do. I think that it is safe to say that I have finally reached an all time low."
I must kill myself. He would be better without me.,I was molested from age 5-6/7 I can't remember well. This year has been hell. I cannot cope I think I must go. To protect everyone I love and hold dear to me. For the better. I've been getting nightmeres and horrible thoughts about hurting my brother who is everything to me. I'm so scared all the time. I'm scared I will become like the man who used me as a child. People say that the abused go on to abuse I think I'm turning into a monster and I can't stop it. The more I fight the thoughts the stronger they come the more elaborate they become but if I don't fight them I feel dirt and horrible. I feel like a monster and I want to kill myself for it. I get nightmares that he comes back and abused all my friends and he forces me into a monster who has to do whatever he wants. I don't want to hurt anyone and I never have. But these thoughts. They will not stop . I always worry that i'm turning into a pedo I'm always scared. I'm always scared that maybe I hurt my brother or someone in the past but don't remember. I've been to the GP 4 times with no help nothing. I told my Dad 3-4 times about the molestation when I was small only to have him ignore me and tell me to forget about it.I told my mum and she just gave me anointed oil and tells me to put it on my head. It's like this is a joke. It's not a joke at all. Why can nobody see that? This is terrifying and I don't know what to do. I've asked for help many times and I've always been ignored. Maybe it's because I'm a girl if a male came with these thoughts they would put him in a mental hospital asap. But because I'm a short innocent looking girl soft spoken I'm a joke. I have nowhere to turn. What should I do I really think killing myself is the best. I protect my brother from my thoughts and I stop suffering in this way. I've exhausted all other options. I've tried I really have but to no avail. This has made me loose my faith in god I prayed all the time but I saw myself slipping away whilst I felt like talking to a brick wall. What farther would let his child suffer like this after begging for help . All I do is cry and sleep. I can't concentrate I push my brother away because i'm so scared I can't even sit without worrying.
I'm about to let it go,"About a year ago, I got diagnosed with depression. Every fucking day seems like I am a stake getting pounded into the ground and hammer hits me further into an inescapable hole. I'm 18, never dated anyone, never kissed anyone. I've tried but I get rejected. I consider myself unattractive and I feel like the lack of interest of girls helps support my claim. I start college in January and I don't party or anything so I won't have any luck finding someone there. I can't get myself to love myself. I feel like if someone loved me, I could finally accept myself, but after dealing with another rejection today it doesn't look like it. I've tried suicide twice. Once I pussied out, the other time I fainted before painting my walls red. I can't fucking stand to live in a world where i'm trampled on and feel like im left out. I have (had) hobbies but i just lost interest in them. The only thing that puts me off from doing this is my family which i feel guilty for, but I guess you don't feel guilty dead..."
I'm going to get house with a gun. I wonder if these posts will be on the news.,No one responded to my previous post. Probably to long. Fuck it.
Hey guys. It's the guy from earlier,"I was kinda drunk. _��� I really appreciate the support. Still kinda drunk but she called me and told me how much she cares about me. I also want to reiterate that it wasn't mainly about her.  I just realized I was really depressed. Thanks guys. If you want check out my Instagram. @9clout
Thanks guys"
I've been sitting with my 9mm in my hand for the last hour and I just can't pull the fucking trigger for some stupid reason,There's this stupid fucking voice in the back of my mind saying tomorrow will be better. Don't do it. I feel like such a fucking pussy and fuck up. I can't even fucking kill myself properly. I don't know what to do. I'm going outside for a smoke.
Lost my best friend to suicide 2 days ago.,"He wasn't just my best friend. He was my brother. The guy who understood me and I understood him! He was like my soulmate. He was in a depression, but never really talked about it just in the last few weeks. He could never be truly himself. All his life he pretended to be something he is not just to fit in with everyone's expectations. He was homosexual. I was the only person who he told it to and from the beginning to end I accepted this and had no problems with it, but he was afraid of other's reaction and how it would affect his life. I don't know the exact reason why he did it. I think he had other problems going on too. I miss him so much and at the same time, I'm angry at him for such an action. Leaving me here in this horrible world of pain. The loss of him made me rethink everything. I feel lost. I feel suicidal. I may actually feel what he felt before he left. He was a good guy. The best I ever knew. He was good hearted. He was everything a decent man should be. Rest in peace to him. He lived 20 years."
I just need another person.,"A stranger preferable. Someone to talk to, who knows nothing about me or my life. I am in such a dark hole but there are others around me who have it worse. I want....need to overcome a lot of personal demons to help those around me. But I just want to close everyone and everything out, turn to highs, and ignore the everlasting lows. Sometimes I think it'd be easier to end it all and not worry about anyone else's problems or my own, but I even I know that's selfish. Fuck..I'm probably posting this on my main. Whatever, shit needs to be out in the air. If any of my friends see this, hell if the ones who are in danger see it, know I'm here for you. You need to know I'm in just as much pain too though.
Edit: Hey guys I've been busy the past day or so but all the replies have been monumentally helpful. I'll do my best to reply to all of you, I can't tell you how much it means to me to hear these kind words."
I've managed to push everyone away and now I'm all alone,"I've recently separated from the military (no deployment) and I've been struggling with the transition back to a normal life. I've been finding it physically difficult to even speak to people. It's not that I don't want to socialize, I know what I want to say in my head but when I try to speak, I can't produce a word. I had to eventually explain through text to my closest friends why I'm so distant and quiet hoping��they'd still stay in my life��cause I know I'm pushing them away. They tell me, ""I understand man I'm here if you need anything"", yet when I need then the most, no response, 12 hours... 2 days... 1 week, obviously they're only there when they're free and feel like dealing with it, when they eventually replied I can't even bother to respond. I get it, it's a shitty spot to put people in when they don't go through it themselves, everyday so black and white, dull and uneventful. I broke and ended up reaching out to a hotline the other day to talk to someone but it brought on more questions. I never really had a plan before I talked to the hotline, the person asked that question a lot, I started to dwell on that question.��I now have a plan and a date in mind, not in the immediate future but a date nonetheless. I don't know what my problem is, my life isn't even that difficult compared to other people's stories. I've lost any sort of motivation, everything just pisses me off, I can't even find pleasure in my hobbies anymore. The person on the hotline said it sounds like I lost the will to live. I can't even seek help from the VA since I've never deployed, they see non-combat veterans as low risk and should have no mental issues. Half of me knows something is wrong and is screaming for help, the other half gave up and just wants to push that date up.��"
My mom wont let me,"I cant kill myself because of my mom. I think she actually loves me. I think the hormones messed with her head, she has a birth attatchment to me. And it would make her all crazy if i suicide.I think about dying so often but i never think im going to do it anymore. I did once and was in inpatient. Every day that happens i regret. I regret every day that has happened. I dont want tomorrow to happen. I dont want the next 10 minutes  to happen. I cant choose things or think about things anymore my mind is degrading. Somone has to tell me what to do because all i choose is death"
Got slapped,"I sent a bad joke to my friend two hours ago. He read it and didn't reply. An hour later, I woke up because there's a knock on my door and I got slapped; he stared for awhile and leave without saying anything with a serious face. I just woke up so the event sink in slowly, when I realized what happened I ran as fast as I can. When I saw him he's about to ride the bus. I walk closer to him, he gave me a questioning look, and i kissed him on the cheek. He got surprised. Then I told him, ""you slap like a girl, dude"". He pouts and chased me as i ran laughing. We got tired and stopped running, then he give me a hug. We said goodbye to each other and he told me, "" Don't let this be the last goodbye, idiot.""P.s. It's really funny cause he's a guy and he slapped me real hard, my left cheek really hurts until now. Hahahahaha! He didn't even say sorry, that scumbag! _���_���_���
        The chat i sent him was about me saying goodbye cause i can't take it anymore, although i only said it(for now) to see what would be his reaction if I do the deed, I didn't expect him to come in my house(just to slap me lmao) because he's staying in his aunt's which is 45mins away( without traffic). We've never seen each other for a month, too so it is a real surprise. _���To my friend: Thank you. :) One of the reason I got depressed was I lost contact to you and I can't tell anyone else of my problems. But i guess, you really just gave me a good ""awakening"" today, i hate you for reaching me out with a slap. _��� I can't tell you now that I'm really depressed because i knew you'll be worried, so i only send you a message saying ""i hate you. Let's meet again when you're free."", to ensure you I'm still not going...When i've moved on, I'm going to let you see this, idiot."
My last week,"This is surreal
Im 25 years old, canadian, male. Im unemployed now, ive relapsed, im thousands of dollars in debt, im almost totally alone and have been for what feels like years. I wrote a post a few months ago when things were just dark, but i got over it. This is different. This isnt just me feeling sad, this is me totally out of options. I dont want to die, and knowing i have to do this has made that even more obvious, and im scared. But ive gone no where with life, i have no direction for the future, and where im at with things right now, i have to do this because i dont want to live homeless, i cant bare to tell my family whats going on, and if i did they already told me they would cut me out of their lives, and they are the only people that ever talk to me now and i cant lose that. But im scared, and im really really alone. I wish i didnt have to do this but im out of options, and it just seems like life has worked out this way, things never went the right way, so many times when i tried the right thing it failed, i was rejected, and things never worked out. And im tired of that battle, maybe im just to weak, idk. I dont think i should have lived alone but my family wouldnt let me stay at home cause i was to old, they wanted me out. I wrote this once already but accidentally deleted it, im just trying to remember everything i said.. Its sad that i have roughly 3 days left and im spending them the exact same way, mostly cause im so poor i cant go anywhere and im to sick to want to be outside. I wish things had worked out differently, but i just want to spend these last days talking to some people, and i know some will try and talk me out of this but its almost not even my choice now, its either die, or be homeless and even more alone. It helps tie up some lose ends and it stops me from ever being a financial burden on anyone.
To anyone else contemplating suicide, please really consider all your options and think about the situation. If you can survive, do it. Where im at i cant survive. My roommate is using our friendship against me and not paying rent, putting more financial stress on me cause he knows i dont want to kick him out. My family wont help me anymore, not after my early twenties and the shit i did. Anyways i could ramble for hours, but someone say hi and lets just swap stories and talk. I have 3 days left and ill be on here most the time because here is the only place i can be honest about whats going on, i look forward to hearing from you"
I just don't.,So tired So tired So tiredI don't want to go on anymore.
Tips on improving on self esteem. My reasons to live are pathetic.,"I went through severe depression last year and chopped off all my hair. During this time I found a podcast Cloverfeels and at that time that was the only reason why I kept moving forward.There's few things that motivate me to wake up including baking, EDM, food, podcasts, running, watching sports, and YouTube. I like my boss, job, and team. I'm getting tired of being underemployed and not having a best friend or boyfriend anymore. I get job interviews but my mental illness probably comes through during the interview with my resting bitch face. Does anyone have tips on improving self esteem? I tried therapy and medication; both didn't help. Does anyone have pathetic reasons to live?"
Genetically fucked and I don't know what to do with my life,"When I think about life, I just think about how fucked I was genetic wise. I could have been balding with a slightly above average dick and I would have been happy. But no, I somehow managed to be balding with a skinny ass dick at the age of 18.On top of that, I'm a virgin. I could have had oppurtunities to lose my virginity in high school but I was too much of a beta and I was scared that the girl would laugh at my dick (5.5 length and 4.2 girth). I mainly hate how skinny it is tbh.Girls used to call me cute when I was in high school but now I'm just an antisocial, unconfident fuck with a receding hairline who is barely passing his classeseven though I try to better myself (went to the gym for like 6 months and did no fap) nothing happens.
My 23 year old brother brags about his ""amazing dick"" and he is showing no signs of balding. He has a great body, gets great grades, and is going to a great school.I try to study but I just get distracted and I just don't care anymore. Wish i can get in a car crash so I can stop worrying about all this shit.I just wanna cut everyone off and become successful.I feel like my youth is being wasted. I honestly don't see myself living for another 5 years. I suck at my own hobbies and I fucking hate school, it's not for me. But people make it seem like it's the only way to become successful. I'm too scared to kill myself but I wish I had the balls to do it. I spend so much time worrying about how I look. I look at every mirror I pass by, and I really want to stop thinking about how I look but I just can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm that ugly, but I'm just wasted potential. I'll only look good with hair due to my weak jawline. If I had nice hair I would be so good looking, if I had a nice dick I would be so confident. Idk at this point im just listing shit that annoys me "
Inferior human being.,I am an inferior human being and I don't want to live anymore because I want to be one of the beautiful intelligent people.
im letting my body die.,"I am sad. I didn't realise I was here. I'm on so much medication. I hate medication. I'm struggling to take it. And even when I do it's not at the right time or consistent. I don't even know if it does actually help as I can't take it when I should.
I haven't slept properly for days. I took this morning off, and then still didn't sleep. I'm not drinking enough water. I know this. My kidneys are radiating pain. Around my back, up my side, down through my hips and into my upper thighs.
I have had kidney pain for over a week. It's getting bad now.
And yet. I can't bring myself to drink water. I have never drunk enough. What good would it do now anyway. I'm physically sore now. Not just in my thoughts. I match. It feels right. And I feel like me. I deserve this. This is me.
I get that some people have low self-esteem. And that leads them to feeling this way. But I don't think I have low self-esteem. I actually quite alright.
I just rightly and correctly acknowledge that I am a piece of shit. I get that. And it must be true, because I don't have low self-esteem.
My logic is not logical, I get that. But I still believe it. I don't even think I believe it. I just know it to be true.I get like this. I won't eat if I'm sad. I'll want it. But it's either too difficult. Or I don't need it anyway. I don't deserve it.
I'll get sad. I won't sleep. I won't eat. My body hurts. I get cold. I burn myself in the shower. I wait a few days. It will pass. I've never felt this bad in my kidneys before. I'm simultaneously scared I may actually be hurting myself, and relieved that maybe this will be it. Maybe I'll pass without anyone knowing I wanted it. Maybe not even me. I'm not worried about dying. I'm worried about irreparable damage and then not dying. And then here I am. Posting in this sub. Not sure if I'm asking for help, or just don't want to be alone. I don't know. Pain being gone is good. Just don't see a way there.I have an apt with my GP and then Psychiatrist in 2 days. I know i just have to wait til then. hopefully they'll see how it is without any need to say it."
I would do it if not for this,"I have found myself on the edge a whole bunch of times this year. I have felt beaten, battered and bruised beyond repair. Countless evenings spent crying on the bathroom floor can attest to that.I've wanted to end it. I've wanted to get out of feeling this way. I've wanted to kill myself. And I would've, if not for this thought.I thought about suicide, thought about how absolutely worthless I was feeling, how useless to society I really am, and how the world would be a better place if I just left. But then, I thought about all those people who weren't useless. People who were actually highly functioning individuals, who could've made a difference to society, who probably didn't want to die, but did. People who could've had long, succesful lives, but we're denied that opportunity. Somehow, I feel it is unfair that they died, and I'm still alive. I wish I could die, and by doing so, I could bring one of those people back to life. But I know I can't. For some reason, this has kept me from actually taking my own life. Don't know why."
I don't have anything to live for anymore.,"I've been suicidal for a good part of almost ten years now. I always just try to push it out of my mind because I have a little sister who looks up to me and would be devastated, and for my family's sake. Id like to share my story, because time and time again I've been told everything is my fault and I know it's not. But it feels like it is. My cousin raped me when I was 14, I'm 23 now. He stole my innocence from me. He stole any goodness or warmth that was in my heart. Now it's just a black hole that explodes every once in a while. My family split into three sides, the side that blamed me, the side that was neutral and didn't care, and the side that blamed him (which was my parents alone). This happened and I tried to kill myself regularly for months taking pills only to wake up in pools of vomit and feces after sleeping for days, I spent quite a bit of time in psych wards as a minor and then I found drugs, I stopped going to school, never graduated, dabbled in college a little, nothing notable. I did drugs instead. I did every psychedelic I could find to try to alter my mind and not make me think about my death or taking my own life. I also found sex, and to this day I have a problem with sex, drugs, and constant suicidal ideation. I've planned my suicide many ways many times. I have a box full of suicide notes. I fuck random people because it doesn't matter anymore. I had a boyfriend for a while who was really good to me but I still have to fuck things up by having random one night hook ups. What isn't something that people understand is that sex can be a coping mechanism much like drugs and alcohol. I know it's something that shouldn't be forgiven. And I don't know why I keep doing it. I've done it in literally every single relationship I've been in and I don't know how to stop but god I want to stop so badly. Words can't describe. I thought I was with the man I wanted to marry. But I cheated on him three times and I still expect him to take me back and love me which is delusional in itself. Not to mention I'm obviously ridiculously mentally unstable and I'm a ticking time bomb constantly. My life is a fucking mess and has been consistently a mess for the last 10 years and I don't know what to do anymore. Every spare moment is spent crying and thinking of the most painless way to commit suicide and which way would be least traumatic for the person who finds me. What the fuck can I even do anymore. "
Just another suicidal person,"Hello. I don't know why I'm making this, I'm not trying to be edgy or anything. Just wanting to explain how I feel, Maybe some of you might get it.
I'm suffering.. I don't remember the last time I was actually okay, lately every thing feels like an effort for everyone but myself. They say its good for me. No its only good for them to see another person go into their agenda. Living a social life, a lie. Its a lie to me. Fuck this bullshit. Everyday is misery and no one notices my pain. They only notice what I've true doing to get out of this Fucking life. Living. I don't feel like I'm living. The only reason I'm not dead already is because of this one girl 3 k miles away.Im a piece of shit. White privileged piece of shit. At least I have a job and papers but god i feel so useless. I don't want to get up everyday. I don't want to breath. Sometimes I try seeing if I can just stop breathing. Or shut off a part of my brain that makes me remember to breath. So I can just fall and die. But if I did, shed be in pain and god who knows if this pain will go away while I'm aliveLast week I got diagnosed for severe depression. Anxiety and bipolar disorder. Fuck. I don't want to be here. I don't want to see people looking at me different. If I just did go through with my death I hope people could move on. Just move on, but no. Apparently I'm just seeking attention. ""Crying for help"" Fuck them all. I don't want help. I'm not crying for attention. I'm only here because I don't want my fiance to die. I only went to therapy last week and to get diagnosed because my girlfriend was worried about me. Because I laid on the train tracks.
I just want them all to leave me alone. What is wrong with me? I don't know.  Literally every thing. I don't have motivation anymore. Anything else I do is just to please everyone else. To be a ""great HAPPY citizen"" and a part of ""society""
I'm isolated. Even with therapy. I keep getting worse. Angrier. Sadder. I'm just trying to hold on to this.
I'm scared that all my problems are making my girl's problems worse "
I'm killing myself tomorrow.,"I'm sick of being stressed out all the time, I'm sick of being lonely, and I'm sick of heading nowhere.I'm stuck in a literally useless degree (Creative Writing) because it's the only thing I'm ""good"" at even though I hate everything about it. I've lost almost all my friends and have no desire to make new ones. I have zero desire to continue dealing with this bullshit, I'm sick of college, I'm sick of life, I'm sick of being me.E: I'm gonna sleep on it, thanks for all the support and helpful comments. Also, shoutout to the tryhard morons that were egging me on you made me laugh for the first time in a long time, so thanks for that.E2: I figured I should let everyone know that I'm ""okay"", still feel like shit but still alive."
People give me reasons to stay..but don't be to stay..,"I really wish from the bottom of my heart that i could give you some good reasons, but im not in a position where i can think of any for myself either. I know its hard and painful, but hopefully just knowing that there is someone out there who cares what happens to you, that you choose to live even if just for one more day, is a good enough reason. "
Im going to be homeless in 2 days and will lose my animals. Im disabled with Fibromyalgia. Im leaving this world. I have nothing left.7,"I have an evil landlady who is 75. She has. ""Fiance"" in a prison. Hes a felon serving 13 yrs. Hes 30 yrs younger than her. Shes rich. She does whatever he says. Hes a moron who found out 7I was getting ready to go to law school. Im not enrolled - the law school cant help me. Please dont go there. He was coming up for a possible Judicial Release and wanted to make sure he got out. This nutty landlady, who lives next door to me approached me 0saying he wanted my phone number in case she had a ""health emergency"" [read money emergency]. I knew this was nonsense but she pressured me big time, insinuating I needed to do this because she let me have my 2 dogs and cats here. I very reluctantly agreed. He wanted me to do legal research for him and write a letter to the judge on hid behelf and he wasnt nice about it it. He called me all day every day. He began threatening me, subtley but clearly. He also said I would lose my apt and my animals. This woman told him every personal thing she knew about me. I started losing weight. I began seeing a therapist for the first time in my life. I knew if I refused his calls or wouldnt help him she would evict me. I cant afford another apt where I could have my animals. I have no family, no friends. I dont know anyone here. Im in a suburb of Cleveland called Lakewood. Please dont argue with me that she cant legally evict me. She can an last Thurs she did. In OH you need NO reason. It was a verbal lease. The hearing was a joke. I didnt get to present any evidence or literally say one single word. Landlady knew the magistrate like they were best friends. She sais, "" I want her out"". The felon didnt get his Judicial Release. Shes mad at me that she wont get to marry him. Right. I am very ill with Fibromyalgia. My life is nothing but pain and fatigue. But I work as much as I can. I have a pending SSI application but it can take 2 yrs. I have 2 .days. I could find another place to live but I had 16 days. With the animals and my illness 16 days isnt enough time. Theres an agency that claims they will SO help you: Lakewood Service Center. Theyve done virtually nothing. Theyve taken their sweet time and wasted what little time I had. Its a cruel joke. I contacted one of the TV stations via their contact form but never heard back from them. Thise LSC is telling me I have to give up my animals. Not doing that. I actually found a place with a family that will take me and the pets but LSC have to inspect the home. They will give you $1000 for 1st mo rent and deposit if it passes muster. It will, but it cant be done in 2 days. This really enthusiastic social worker who is supposed to do the inspecting during the day, M-F. These people work. They cant do that. The public kennels here are hell holes that make you wish you were dead just going inside. Thats why I want to go to law school - to get animals Civil Rights. My 2 dogs and my cats are all geriatric. 2 are sick. They need me. I cant take it. I love them. Theyre all all I have in the world. Im 59 yrs old. Not 23. I cant take abandoning them - they will think) in this hell hole. Itll probably kill 2 of them. NO THEY DONT PROVIDE THEM MEDICAL CARE. The workers hate them.
IVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. NOTHING. I have lost 50 lbs in 4 months from anxiety and seeing this coming. The hardest part of all is not taking myself out its abandoning my animals. They will suffer in hellish misery for 10 days to 2 wks before they put them dowm- KILL THEM. GAS THEM TO DEATH. This has been my lifes work. I know what they do. I wish somebody could help me but Im so tired I have nothing left. 2 days. *I would give so much for 1 real friend. I could stay in someones garage. But no one will help or care. After Im gone there may likely be some public discussion about how ""unstable"" I was. Im not unstable. There is NOTHING wrong with me.p but Ive had enough - Ive been fighting this for months. I have nothing left. Im leaving. In a few days my dogs and cats I love with be with me.."
Whats your opinion on this ?,"For religious beliefs, I am scared to commit suicide. I'm thinking that I can try to get cancer through using things which are known to cause cancer. I'm just scared that I might cause cancer and have cancer in the future, and may not want to die anymore. Also, it means I can't get married or have kids because I know I'm dying early. Idk what's your opinion on this ?"
I am an alien in my own life,"I cry more often than not. My husband died almost three years ago. My dog of 18 years shortly after him. I'm in a relationship now with a man I love so much; I can't stop telling myself how much better he'd be without me.I am on about 8 medications. I will bring up to my psych about how I'm thinking about suicide more and more. I am struggling with fertility for no known reason. My dogs are assholes even though I love them. My family doesn't care about me. I usually just waste the day away until I can go to sleep again.I have no friends- the only ones I do have live far away. I can't lose weight. I think of all the ways I could kill myself, and how many people would even fucking care.I want to even check myself into a hospital but I don't want it to ever effect my future like jobs or adoption.I feel like I can't relate to anyone. I'm a young widow, diagnosed with multiple disorders, too old to be with the young crowd and childless to fit in with the Moms. Even my Reddit posts on my other account venting about my infertility got judged.Please tell me why I shouldn't end it all now."
What are the steps to get help?,"I have called my national suicide hotline twice now. The people on the other side were nice and wanted to be helpful but none of them gave me a clear specific answer on the steps to seek professional help. Well maybe they did, maybe I'm just dumb as shit and didn't understand them. The problem is I currently don't have a personal doctor to go to with this so I don't know what the alternatives are. So I guess this is me asking what are the steps to getting help? Also please don't tell me to open up to a friend or family member because on top of everything I do not want to also babysit them. Now I'm not from/in the US so the steps are going to be a bit different but at this point any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"I`ve come to a point in my life where I`ve realized I have some deep mental issues, and I dont know if I should live anymore","Hi reddit. I'll just start by saying that english isn't my native language, so dont get caught up in my grammar mistakes. This is going to be a long post, but i hope someone will take their time to read all of it, it would mean a lot to me. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this either, but here goes.I am a 20 year old guy who just started at university, about two weeks now to be exact. The school is my countrys best school in the field of economics, a study I wasn't sure if fits me, but I've always kind of liked math, so I thought ""Hell, I'll try and see how it goes"".Since I was a kid and started at school, I've always had a lot of friends, I was good at sports, popular with the girls, overall a pretty good and safe childhood.
It's in the last weeks I have come to realize to myself that i have some pretty deep, bad, mental issues.I consider myself a pretty introverted guy, so moving away from my hometown to a new city where i knew nobody, felt like a huge change for me. I have always kind of tried to avoid social situations where I might feel uncomfortable, like talking in front of a crowd or being the center of attention. I choke, I start to stutter, and worst; I sweat. I do not know why, but it starts with a few
drops on my forehead and escalates to entire head and forehead. This is an evil spiral, I become aware that I am sweating and knows that the person/people I am talking to notice it, making me more uncomfortable and nervous, wanting to just run away from
the situation. That's one of the main reasons why I try to avoid uncomfortable social situations.Another problem is my conversational skills. Talking to someone I don't know well or feel uncomfortable around, I can't keep up a normal conversation. I keep thinking not to fuck up and say something stupid, and I keep thinking 'What would be smart to say, what's a clever thing to say now', and I end up being so unconcentrated that I can't hear what the other person is talking about, fucking up the conversation. This makes me stressed like hell, and in most cases I begin to sweat. That's when the panic shoots, I know I now seem like a retard in front of everyone.So these two last weeks has completely crushed my self esteem, I am now in a place where I don't feel like life is worth living anymore. All day, any place I walk, I am thinking 'Please don't start sweating and make a fool of yourself', because I care immensely what people think of me. It sounds stupid,
I've tried getting over this, but I can't. It has come to a point where I have realized that whatever I do in life,
I will always be that socially awkward guy who sweats and stresses out. This has made me realize that whatever I plan doing,
I will not be able to relax and enjoy life, a torture I can't live with.The reason I just can't kill myself is that I love my family so much..Killing myself would break their hearts, so I can't get myself to do this... I've always considered suicide as a selfish act if you leave behind someone who cares about you, even if you think it's the only way out. So my other alternative
is to run away. I enjoy my own company, and running away into the woods or someplace in this world where I could be alone and still be able to contact my family  in a way seems like the best way for me to go right now. I have a budget of about 13 000 USD, so I guess that could get me somewhere.
I guess another option could be to get a job where I avoid being in contact with a lot of people, so I could hide my social fear.Right now I am just lost and depressed, I can't focus so I've fallen behind on every subject at school, only thinking about what I am going to do with my life. Because the way it is now, its not worth living. I guess im writing this here in hope that someone who has been in a similar situation could come with some advice, or just someone I could talk to.. if there are any pills or drugs I could take to help me get over my social anxiety, or make me stop sweating, it would be a great help.
Thank you for reading this."
Why do I feel this way,"I have a big meme account on Instagram. I'm a really successful athlete. I'm popular. No one knows that I want to just fucking die. I just want to die more than anything. I'm 17 and live on my own in the basement of some bodies house. I pay rent. I'm successful by social standards. But what made me realize I wanted to die was while I was writing something to a girl I've been talking to for a while. I'm just gonna copy and paste it. Keep in mind we are best friends in snapchat so I talk to her the most out of anyone and she's the same with me. Also we hang out for hours. Also she is really really hot. And not basic. Here it isFirst of all I'm glad I met you and we are not gonna stop talking cause there is no one else I'd rather talk to. Second of all I'm sorry for making you cry. That was really weird for me cause I haven't been that close to crying in a really long time.  Third I think you're confused and conflicted and a lot of that is my fault which makes me feel even worse. I say this cause one second you're telling me how you want to break up with your boyfriend and staying up with me till 3 in the morning talking about complete bullshit just so we don't have to hang up. Then the next you tell me how you just want to friendzone me and that you want a hug from your boyfriend and you need to talk to me less. And it hurts me.  Cause it pulls me in closer to you. And then you push me away. And obviously you could just stop talking to me and me to you. But I don't want that. I really don't. I actually have fun being around you no matter what it is we are doing. And I know you feel the same.
I hate being something that causes stress in your life Mary. I just want to make you happy. But it's hard to try and maintain a balance of supporting you in what's best for you, when what's best for you is awkward for us to talk about. You have a boyfriend yeah. A boyfriend in a different state who you may see once or twice a year who you don't love anymore but you have fond memories of.  And it's really hard cause you're for real my dream girl which sounds really gay and edgy and I cringe at my awkwardness as I type this but it's true. I haven't ever said some gay shit like that before. And I know you have flaws and insecurities but that's what I like about you. You're really complex and it's really amazing. And I really like everything about you. And I know it may be hard to read this but that's life Mary. Life is fucking hard. Some days I'm miserable and regret everything I've ever done. I wake up in a cold basement every morning and walk to my cold kitchen and drink a glass of water from the sink. Then I take a shower and get dressed in the clothes I bought with my own money and walk the silent 30 minutes to school. I normally don't say my first word in the morning till at least an hour after I woke up. Cause I have no one to say it too. I feel so lonely sometimes. And it's weird cause I wake up to 60 messages of people calling me a god and trying to pay me to make them bigger. So why do I feel so lonely and awful. Why do I feel like no one actually cares. Except you. The person who says she doesn't care. The person who acts like me and her don't matter at all and that she doesn't even care. Why do I feel like she's one of the few people who care so much. There's no way I'm wrong. I don't even know if I'm going to send this cause I'm a pussy no matter how tough I might act. And if I did send it it's only cause I'm scared that if i don't, I'll lose you.
At this point i realized I'm miserable. Now I'm thinking about getting really drunk. Going to her house and telling her this and depending on what happens killing myself after. I guess we shall see how this goes"
My friend told me he has been having suicidal thoughts and I don't know what I can do to help him.,I just need any advice on what I can do to help him.
This is my last week,"Hello, i'm thinking to do it from a long time and after trying and trying to make my life better i decided that it's enough.
I struggled with depression for about 5-6 years, i'm 24.
I had to quit university because IBS made me force to quit exams, i can't find a job, my gf left me after 6 years togheter, i don't have friends.
I tried theraphy and I feel only stuck.
I tried to force my self to go to gym ( i'm going since 6 months ) but it's mostly a pain for my IBS.
I tried to go out in louds club where people of my age gather but I can't manage to make friends in that kind of events ( too loud and too much drunk peoples ).
Online dating/meetup.com are waste land here.
I sent 50+ curriculum and got only 2 replies for interviews where i didn't get the job.
I cry myself to sleep everynight and i can't do it anymore.
I almost done it at my birthday few months ago but I got too much scared.
I feel out of the world but i'm not scared to die anymore, maybe it's not the right thing to do but I feel that it's the only thing I can do to go away from here."
I sincerely feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001... seriously.,"One night I decided it was time to die. I've never fit in anywhere, and I've always been a ghost. I never had a friend and I'm not exaggerating. Throughout middle school and high school I kept to myself and I always was an outcast for reasons unbeknownst to me. One night I grew tired of it all and I decided to end my life in 2001. I bought a bundle of heroin, some Klonopin to calm my nerves, and 1.5L of vodka. After downing a significant amount of Vodka and taking the Klonopin, I decided it was time. I injected a lethal dose of heroin - that I'm absolutely sure of. I was also alone -as was usual- so there was no one to save me. I passed out into oblivion. For a brief moment I experienced pure nirvana and peace... I accepted myself for what I was and it was beautiful. I no longer felt the need to connect with others and I was all right with being alone for eternity. Here's where things get strange: The next thing I recall is being put into an ambulance but not in a literal or physical way. I saw it as if I was above myself. I saw the EMT working on me and I recall my family looking on from the window of the ambulance (yes... the stereotypical out-of-body experience and I'm not even religious) . As bizarre as it sounds, I was able to see and experience every emotion of it all. I experienced the sadness of my family, the panic (or perhaps more accurately the intense concentration) of the EMTs because I had no vitals, and the determined nature of the driver to get me to the ER as soon as possible. If I agree with the the story told to me by my family, I was forced into coma for several days in order to let the drugs seep out of my body. When I awoke,  I immediately claimed I was dead and yet my family insisted I wasn't. I had to spend an additional day in the hospital and I NEVER saw a nurse or anyone but my mother. The hospital was quiet and this, in itself, was strange. To anyone who has been in a hospital, there is always a bunch of noise and a nurse routinely checks in on you. Anyhow, the only person I saw during the night was my mother who stayed oddly quiet. The next day I was released and things and people seemed... odd.My opinion is that I died and I don't use this term loosely. I sincerely feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. Sixteen years later I find that I am still a ghost, only more so. When I'm cutting grass and wave to my neighbors, they don't wave back. I also haven't left my house in sixteen years. After I died (or so I believe), I also came across a mysterious amount of money that has let me become a recluse. Let me rephrase that: I was able to buy a new house in cash -but I grew up insanely poor so this makes no sense- and now I'm kept inside a house that is completely alien to me. I must admit, this all seems too convenient and very bizarre. I can't help but feel I actually died and this may very well be the afterlife. Anyone else in this situation? I haven't ruled out the possibility I have just lost my mind, but I'm absolutely certain everything I have said is true when it comes to the important facts. I even have the hospital receipts to prove it to a point, as well as the mortgage info. The only factor that remains debatable is whether I was actually saved or not. The thing is, the events that transpired in me being saved make absolutely no sense. I was absolutely certain to make sure I would die that night and my family wasn't around to help me. However, my brother claims he randomly stumbled across me and saw that I wasn't breathing which is completely out of character (he wasn't even near the area I OD'd in). It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel my psyche is some how attempting to cope with my death. Even more disturbing is the events after the attempt, my father suddenly claimed he forgot about a pension and then gave me enough money to buy a home and live in absolute seclusion. I grew up INSANELY poor and prior to my suicide I struggled to find food and merely survive. Now he suddenly comes across a TON of money I'm living a comfortable life in absolute seclusion. To sum it up: After I ""attempted"" suicide the events that transpired make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. The depressing shit is I'm not happy and I routinely find myself considering suicide. While I'm now in a good home and living comfortably, my families health is quickly deteriorating. Its as if I'm being forced to witness my only remaining connection to this world die off and its absolutely terrifying.Needless to say, I can't help but wonder whether I'm losing my mind. Regardless, I find myself routinely contemplating suicide to test the theory that I'm already dead. Anyhow, I realize this post may sound absurd and I totally understand if its deleted for being off-topic or outright ignored (the latter of which will make sense)."
My wife and I separated a while ago and she attempted suicide tonight. Should I tell her parents?,"Posting from mobile at the hospitalWife tried to kill herself tonight, texted me during the act. We've been separated for 6 months. She has a history of mental illness. Her parents are loving and supportive. Should I tell them? I'm worried that if I do tell them, she'll get upset and won't tell me if she attempts suicide again. I don't want to be her only lifeline, though."
I need someone to hear me,"I don't even know what I need people to hear. I don't have anyone to talk to. No one to reach out to. No one to hear me.I feel like I have a ball of hot lead in my chest burning me from the moment i wake till the moment I fall asleep. I would say Im angry but that isn't the right word. If I let my guard down for even a split second my hands shake with rage. Im so tired of being angry.Angry at the world
Angry at the people I see
Angry at my job
Angry at my bosses
Angry at my family
Angry at my friends
Angry at my selfI know I have a good life, I know i do. I have a decent job, making decent money. I drive a nice car that im paying for myself. I live in a nice home in a safe neighborhood. I have access to clean water, and food. I know objectivly that i live WAY better than most humans on this planet. That being said...I hate my life. I never asked to be born, if i could have i would have passed on the whole fucking thing. I don't want to be here. So far as I can tell life is nothing but lonely misserable pain. I never asked for this, I never wanted this, I don't need any of this.As far back as i can remember, no one, not any friend, colleague, nor familly memeber has EVER looked me in the eye and really asked me ""Are you ok?"" My phone doesnt ring. People don't want to talk to me. People don't look for me. People don't care about me.I think about killing myself every day. I want to kill myself. Im done living. Im done fighting for my meager existance....(let me take a moment: Part of what adds to my frustration and anger at my self is that last sentence. ""fighting for my meager existance"" as ive stated before, i know that i have a good life. I really do and i should be gratefull and happy, but im not! And that just makes me even more enraged! FUCK!!! I HATE ALL OF IT, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY!!!)The only reason I havn't killed myself is because of my mother. She created and raised me, putting forth all the time money and effort, I can't repay all that by just ending my life.
That being said what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and after she dies im gone. All my other familly fucked off to other places that I can't get to. None of them have called me for any reason in years!What does it feel like to have people love you?
What does it feel like to see that your friend is calling you just to talk?
What does it feel like to have some one tell you they love you to your face?
What does it feel like to hold a lover in your arms?
What does it feel like to have someone stop by just to see if you're ok, because ""I havn't heard from you in a few days""?I am alone. I have never formed a genuine connection with anyone.
not my mother, not my closest friend, no one.
I feel weak and pathetic, I feel like an oversensative piece of shit that just can't handle things.I want to cry untill I can't see.
I want to scream untill i can't breath and pass out.
I want my friends to call me.
I want my familly to care about me.
I want my job to not feel like slavery.
I want to fuck a beautiful person.
I want to race my car.
I want to practice martial arts.
I want to dream.I don't want to be alive any more.
Im done being angry, frustrated and ignorant. Im so confused and conflicted about so very many different things. I feel like all I truly understand is hate, rage, anger, frustration, fear, anxiety, and sorrow.what does love feel like?
what does happiness feel like?
what does it feel like to be content?
Whats it like with no stress?
What does it feel like to have no hot ball of lead burning away inside your chest blackening your flesh and buring all emotions away.No one has ever really listened to me. No one can tell me how to fix my problems, but I know of one solution.I can kill my self.No more anger
No more frustratiion
No more pain
no more lonliness
no more confusion
no more fighting
no more hate
no more anything
no more, just no moreAll of it gone, forever. I don't know what im alive.
Why do I keep trying, why do I keep fighting?
So I can keep paying my bills?
keep being rejected by every woman i have every persued?
keep fighting my own way of thinking just to people will think im normal?The futility of life is immense, and insurmountable. I don't get it, I really have nothing. Nothing of substance. Nothin that makes me happy.I have nothing
I am nothing
I want to die
I want to kill myselfAt this point it feels like im keeping myself alive out of some sort of habit, or compulsion. Like how you can hold your breath but ultimatly your going to breath again. But in some strange way i can feel my will to live seeping out of me. I'm so confused and scared and lonely. I don't know who I am, what i want, or where im going.
I am not exactly an objective observer, but to me i feel like this just reads like the inept rantings of some weak willed nothing.Can you hear me? Hearing, can you comprehend? Comprehending can you help me?someone...
anyone...
please..."
I'm killing myself when I get back to town,"I've been thinking about it for a while. I traveled from Florida to Utah cause I wanted to see my family one last time. I'm going to steal my sisters Ativan or score some pain killers and down it with alcohol. I have to do it. I'm nothing. I'm a ghost and a former shell of myself. I used to be an actress but I'm too fat and ugly for parts now. All I do is cause my family inconveniences and pain. I work for Disney and am exhausted from having to turn on my fake smile everyday. I have my note ready and everything, I'm just sad to say goodbye to my family. Especially my mom. I used to make her so proud. I'm so scared about my suicide hurting but I hurt too much to keep going. I'm 22 and I feel like I'm 40. I can't stop drinking and eat like shit. I can't stop smoking pot. My meds don't do shit. Nobody wants me around. I just needed some more people to say goodbye to"
i ruined everything,"i got really depressed again, fell pregnant, actually felt some real hope and motivation for the future, had to have an abortion because im too depressed to be a good mum, got even more depressed, tried to have my shifts changed for a short while so i don't have to see so many pregnant women and was told by the head manager that my excuse wasnt good enough, ""fired"" from my job, my partner can't afford to pay fines and debts so his phone, bank accounts and license have been suspended, our credit cards we took out when we were doing well are now overdrawn and the bank is harassing us, and its all my fault. all we needed to do was save a few thousand dollars for our own little starter home. that was our goal. i was working full-time, he was studying law. he had to stop due to the stress i was causing. my hours were cut in half and then ultimately i was taken off the roster altogether. im still an employee but i havent been given hours in over a month. i've begged to be told whats happening, and have been ignored/hung up on. my union told me to grow up and solve my own problems. i havent even had an interview in this whole time that ive been applying for jobs. i dont qualify for disability payments because im too young. our parents can't help us, theyre all struggling themselves. we wanted a family, to go on holidays, to grow old together, to wear matching hawaiian shirt/dresses when we retired. i ruined everything because im a depressed lump of shit who cant function anymore.the only money i have is ~$7000 in superannuation, which i can't access because im too young despite my financial situation. i have my partner and mum as beneficiaries. i just need to be brave enough to get through those few long minutes of pain and discomfort. its the only way at least one of us can get back on their feet again."
Give me some reasons not to....,"Things have been weird for the past year. While I hesitate to say I want to die, I don't think I'm strong enough to keep fighting. I can't find my inner worth anymore. It feels like the world would be better without me...
What are some honest reasons not to commit suicide?"
What to Do?,I'm usually here helping other people but today I need help. Been struggling with depression for two years and my antidepressants have stopped working now. I hit a new low today and all I wanted was to jump off a building. I hate myself for having these thoughts because I don't wanna hurt the people I love. What to do now?  I don't want counselling because I have tried it before and it made me worse. I don't want to go off my meds because I'm scared of what I might feel and do.
i feel like a dying old man in a young man's body,"i am a 21-year-old student, i study part-time, work part-time, have a best friend and several other friends, and a lovely family; i should be happy, right?that being said, i am happy with all those wonderful things (so lucky to have them in my life); but with myself not at all.some days i feel sad because i am worried that i am going to screw up and ruin everything and everyone i care about because of what i think, say, and do.other days, i feel at peace, i feel as if i have in fact died and i am just thinking about what is ahead for everyone else if i were no longer around, or just a ghost walking around town aimlessly and thinking how much easier it would be if  i did not exist.people say you live for those you love and care about and follow your passion.what can you do if you are gradually losing interest in everything you like, living for the ones you have love, but you cannot think of a reason to live for yourself?i am so lost.note: i am not suicidal but definitely indifferent to the idea of my own death and have suicidal thoughts daily, if that makes sense."
Suicidal obsession,"idk what to do anymore. I feel like 10+ years is more than enough to get better. After all the medication combinations, anti depressants, anxiolytics for my anxiety and paranoia, anti-psychotics because im bipolar. I always said i rather have a pill bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy... but I think im wrong. Just a little hole...maybe .9mm wide. I thought about posting but it doesnt seem worth it. Ive pushed my friends and family away by increasingly stupid and impulsive decision making. It really is all my fault, the way i feel... Im honestly in way too fucking deep so this is it. My family just sees me as a shell which is all I really am right. The depression just gets so bad I dont know how to talk to people or participate in active society anymore. I havent pursued a job for the past two years because ive been so mentally unstable and progressively getting worse. I just want to sleep and not wake up. ive been planning to kill myself everyday for the past 6 months. Fuck. Nothing ever makes it better does it? Hopefully that will."
Suicidal Obsessions,"Does anyone else have obsessive suicidal thoughts even when they aren't depressed? Oh I've had plenty of suicidal ideation while depressed, and I know that lovely fantasy of the escape of death very very well, but this is different.My obsessive suicidal thoughts are part of my pure-O OCD. Sometimes I'm not even depressed. It's like another person is living in my head screaming at me to kill myself and I can't stick up for myself and tell them I don't want to. I'm not hearing a voice, it's my own internal dialogue. It's overwhelming, continuous and extremely distressing. I get graphic visuals of me killing myself. And to clarify this happens when I'm not depressed and is not ideation. It's impossible to live with. It's at times where I don't even hate myself like I have when I'm depressed. Like I'm trying to go about my life but the girl inside my head screaming at me to kill myself cannot be quieted. That's when I start thinking of needing to do something like drugs or suicide just to get away from my obsessive thoughts. I don't really have a question, just putting myself out there I guess on a sleepless obsessive night. TL;DR I have suicidal obsessive thoughts that aren't ideation that haunt me"

How can you just forget about me.,"I don't know if I will ever forget the fact that he left me. I don't know if I will ever forget the fact that I told him, ""If you don't want me there, then don't invite me!"" and that was the last set of words that he heard me speak. And he did invite me to something about two years ago, much later, but I didn't go. I couldn't. If I did, would I still be the same fool? Would anything be different? Because I always think it's going to be different and it isn't. It never is. He told me once, ""we will be together in the future, but not right now."" This was said about 6.5 years ago after many nights of ruthless sex and agony that lasted longer than it should have. And the whole time he said he didn't want to be with me. And here I am, what, less than 10 years later and still a fucking fool. Dreaming about him and being prescribed medication for it. Still dreaming about him. So am I supposed to change my mind? It's been too fucking long. What is he waiting for? Is he ever going to try to talk to me again? Just plain conversation? Tell me he is in as much pain as me. Tell me he feels the way I feel, years after being tossed aside like a sack of old clothes."
I Was Going to Kill Myself on June 24th,"I'm sorry if this is too long. But if it is, then don't read it!I chose that date because it was 3 weeks and one day after I graduated high school, and clearly anyone who would have missed me after I died would have contacted at some point in that 3 weeks. When that day rolled around, I told myself that if anyone besides my family (who I live with) tries to communicate with me personally (I.e. no group chats) I would call it off. My friend texted me at some point in the afternoon just asking about if a color dye would show up in her hair (don't know why she asked me, I have never dyed my or anyone elses hair). And while it was just a quick interaction, it made me realize that I must be important enough to her.But ever since then I've felt like I'm in limbo, with no real goal. That date was in my head for 10 or so months beforehand, and now I don't have any real end goal in my life. There is a master's program I would like to get into, but that's more than 4 years in the future, and I doubt that I'll get into it; they only accept 20 or so students per year. Since that day, I started going to college. I have yet to make any real friends; I feel like everyone who has been nice to me there so far just feels sorry for me. I honestly feel like I will try again soon. And because of this, it makes me try less in school because I know in the back of my head it won't matter when I'm gone.I don't know what any of you will do with this information. I feel though that posting this might help me in some way relieve some of my inner stress.tl;dr I was going to kill myself this past June and didn't and now I feel like I'm in some sort of limbo."
It is an odd feeling,"It doesnt feel activemore....
Like i want to just cut out a hole in my chest. More so, have a giant apple core remover and push it into my chest. Take out all the pieces inside. i'd bleed but I'd enjoy it.Its one of those passive suicidal thoughts. I want to go but I know that thats not what Im meant to die from. Im more likely to die from falling down the stairs than my own suicide attempt because I have failed too many times. Only thing I have managed to do is mess up my breathing. I always want to die. I don't know how I would do it though.
I've tried too many different things & I have no gun access.ive thought about stealing my housemate's blade
or hanging from a ceiling fan, which would still affect him. & that reminds me that its a mental thing for me... somehow a male's reaction gets to me... it fuels my emotional - mental soul...and that reminds me how I hate breathing. Maybe it actually is active...
i feel like if i had the strength id break my own neck. If i had the location and ability Id harm myself. I feel like Itd be one of those moments where id enjoy feeling my neck break no matter how painful. Sometimes, I get like that. Someday that part of me might come out more. Its what made me cut my hand open. Its what bothers me frequently about slicing my neck. Its like worse monster than just my normal suicidal thoughts. It sucks that its been so long since ive experienced a day where I don't think about suicide. No wonder I've attempted so much. "
Its all about faking everything.,"Fake smiling. Fake enjoying your work. Fake that you love to study all the shit. Fake, fake fake fake fake fake fake, effort effort effort work work work work work work.hahhahaI wish i coukd be fucking carefree as all of you you lucky bastardsi feel like smashing my fucking laptop on the wall and screaming why does eveyrything need to tkae effortwhy are you all agreeing to thiswhy can't we just die easily and be done with all that jazz?"
It's not worth trying to save my life,It's really not.All these people that tell me that it can be better and you deserve more obviously don't know shit bout my life or the crap I've decided not to deal with
Nobody online or IRL fucking listens to what you're saying,"They think they've fucking listened but they havent- they've read a couple words and then twisted it to suit themselves so they can call you a fucking idiot and stroke their own egosI'm done with reddit, I am done with the people I know and I am fucking done with life. I hate everyone and everything, people just don't fucking read properly or listen they only take in what THEY WANT TO FUCLING HEAR "
I'm thinking about killing myself tonight.. it would be so easy but ir feels so selfish. Will anyone just talk to me?,eh
Pointless life,anyone want to discuss how life is just pointless and doesn't mean shit?
I'm too tired,"I'm 19 and I'm jaded, I feel like I'm too tired to live the rest of my life, so much I'll have to do and so little energy. And I don't feel too excited towards it, I don't think I'd be missing out on much."
Trying to find light at the end of the tunnel,"21 year old male diagnosed with bpd (borderline personality disorder)Ive been unemployed for weeks now because my parents took the car and phone so I couldn't even call in sick to work when I was working just fine at a local car wash and making enough money to pay bills and save for the future, I am constantly getting kicked out,  (at least once every 2-3 weeks usually spanning 3-4 sometimes 5 days) where I am either sleeping in my car (now titled in my name thank God, it wasn't when the took the keys), or luckily finding a place to sleep at a friends house.I have my issues. I admit it to anyone that knows me and I always try to make amends when I wrong someone including family members. But anytime I do something wrong my parents jump the gun and go to kicking me out. I know the answer is get a job, save up, get your own place etc.And not to sound like someone trying to just complain with no solutions because I AM actively working towards that, but what many people don't understand with a disorder like mine (bpd) is the inconsistency of your mental state and mind can cause impulsivity and self destruction almost constantly.What I'm trying to say is, it seems like people like myself can work towards a better life for a while and seem to make progress (I had my own apartment and was paying rent at 20) ONLY to self sabotage everything you've worked so hard for in a fit or stress or rage. Example: I lost my job of seven months and got evicted from said apartment because I was so impulsive I decided it was a better idea to get drunk and do drugs with a girl I liked and call in sick to work the next day. I know damn well I shouldn't do shit like this but I feel like I have the impulse control of a toddler but with the intelligence and awareness of exactly what I am doing to destroy my life like a grown adult.I don't know how to fix myself anymore besides ending my life. I don't know what hope there is for people like me and it's sad because most everyone who knows me loves me, because they don't see my borderline personality up close and in action, they just see me as the intense, overly friendly type person they know and love. So there is little understanding and I get talked down to by most people I go to looking for advice (forums, Reddit, counseling, family) because well, the solution is easy, quit doing stupid shit to fuck up your life??I've been to jail for battery, I've overdosed on stimulant drugs on two occasions, I've been hooked on painkillers, been hooked on alcohol. Yet people tell me I'm one of the ""kindest, most sincere people they know"" and that I've made a huge impact on their life. I don't understand how because I don't see how they see any value in me. I'm a total fuck up.Yes a lot of this is rambling but I am genuinely at a crossroads now where I feel like I am worn out with the rollercoaster I've been living on. I feel like death is an easy solution because I won't have to deal with the pain and the lows associated with my chronic fuck ups anymore. It's not fun being a completely capable and intelligent human being in most respects, and just having one part of your personality which you are all to aware of come unhooked at the worst times in life. I mean shit, I went to jail the DAY before a good job interview which could've drastically improved my quality of life. I told myself don't do anything stupid, if you fuck this opportunity at this job up you're going to be SOL for another few weeks/ months and just repeat the cycle.Back to the point of all this. I'm unemployed and have been for weeks, living with my parents but typing this on my phone in my car in a Walmart parking lot because I got kicked out for the 4th time in 3 months for my own negative actions. I am hooked on steroids and need them to function, hooked on cigarettes and if I quit I get withdrawals which isn't fun but I guess isn't the end of the world, don't have my Adderall so idk if I will be able to function at all at a job (Yes these things do improve my daily functioning majorly, which is a big deal if you're someone like me who just struggles to function in general), I just don't even know. Fuck the rollercoaster. I know a lot of this may sound trivial to many, but that's another thing with bpd. EVERYTHING is the end of the world and you can't stop that dramatic life or death feeling. Losing love with someone feels like you lost your spouse of decades, hearing petty remarks from strangers that are taken the wrong way can spark intense internal rage which can be hard to control, etc etc etc. Fuck borderline personality disorder. It's hell and I commend anyone living with this disorder and encourage you to keep going strong for me. It's just hard. We have a 10% suicide rate. That's right, one out of 10 bpds just kill themselves because they can't take it. Fuck it maybe I'll joinemmmmm"
I'm killing myself on my birthday,"January 4th, 2018.I'm just so out of breath. "
"Completely fucked up, don't give a flying fuck anymore","I'm crazy, I think. I went to the psych ward last night after a breakdown at a garden party. My friends were all with me and made sure I got there safe. Once I was there I waited for hours. I told them I wanted to kill myself and they told me that a suicide center would contact me in about two weeks latest. I dont know what to do. I won't kill myself now but that's only 'cause I feel like I am too weak. I tried once before and didn't succeed. I have much to live for, but I don't have the will. These thoughts are all scrambled because I am drunk and high right now. I don't like this world. It's not for me. Society is fucked up in general. The world is cruel and so am I. I don't want to hurt people around me, but I do. I hate myself. I am weak. I'm still alive because nothing matters in the end, which means that it makes no difference, long term, if I live or not. I am here because I'm scared. I hate myself. I'm really desperate and I'm sick of hurting everyone around me. My suicidal thoughts are always present, but I usually would not act on it because nothing matters in the end. But when I feel worse than already emotionally, suicide comes that much closer. I don't know what to do anymore because I've been through the system so many times and nothing had helped, and this time they just want me to wait until suicide prevention helps me. I want to fix the reason why I'm suicidal because that's what fucks me up. But I don't know the reason. Doctors are filled with conformation bias, and seem to always look for what they think is most interesting (I would know because my parents are both doctors). And therefore I have never gotten a neutral treatment. I don't even know if I truely think I'm the fucked up one. I think it's the world. The world we live in is sick. It's sickening. None of it really matters, but everyone accepts it. The world is cruel, fucked up and inhumane. Maybe I'm sick, maybe it's the world, but I just don't know what to do. I don't wish to be here anymore and I Just don't want to be alone, I hate this place and I don't know what to do anymore, I don't even know if I care about anything on  this fucked up planet, in this fucked up society where everyone is just constantly fucking judged for attempting to stay true to themselves. I fucking hate the fucking media for fucking over everyone and manipulating everyone and just people in general being fucked up and so fucking egocentric, selfcentered and selfabsorbant. Nothing triggered this, I just fucking can't handle this shit anymore "
I will kill myself tomorrow morning,"Tomorrow morning  im going to kill myself and end everything. I have nothing to live for anymoreEveryday Im suffering from living my live. I don't have anyone who cares about me nor have any support from anyone. My family hates me and my coworkers don't seem to like me. It seems like everyone is just getting further from me. Everyone yells at me and treats me like garbage. It would be best i left them all. My dreams and goals to. No one would care. Im not very smart and never had good grades, so I couldn't really advance in school and failed some of my classes in college tooI tried getting help with depression, but it didn't seem to work and now i feel like nothing will work for me.  My life will never get better and things are getting worse. I just cant take it anymore and i wont to die. I tried many times before, im just too scared to do it, but I don't want to live my life anymore. I know people will cry, but im sure it will be tears of happiness that im gone forever. At least i wont be shedding tears anymore..."
Why shouldn't I kill myself,"Major depression/suicidal ideation and anxiety since I was 11 or 12. I have waited for things to get better for years, they have not. They continue to worsen, as does my mental health. I want a reason to continue to live when I feel like I'm guaranteed to suffer."
Poems.,Can I PM someone two poems I've started writing? And give me your feedback. Poetry is helping me cope with my mental illness and suicidal thoughts
Why does no one understand that my life is just suffering and suicides the right thing to do?,Im just saying that its right for me to die. I need it. Its on my mind all the time
Im so scared... No-one listens,"I opened up and no-one gives a damn. I've tried and I've tried. I can't do this anymore. I'm so scared but I'm so tired of everything. My nurse promised to call and she never did.
I do the same thing over and over again, I can't escape from it. I don't care what happens in my life anymore. I don't care about progressing. I've cared too much about what others think, I've lied and I've fooled people. No-one gave a fuck. People say they care but when shit gets real, they leave. That's how it always is. Im a joke and my fucking life is too.
Im lost. I'm done. Im tired. "
I picked a date.,"I just needed somewhere to talk about this. I'm wasting my life on worrying about consequences and responsibilities, and I don't feel like it's in my person to ever change. It's way too deep in my dna to always make the wrong choice and always give up, so I'm just getting everything over with quickly. Up until then I want to stop caring so much and make it count. I'm going to cut out the people I've been talking to even though I don't like them, let myself be impulsive, only do things that make me happy, and stop wasting my time on things that make me feel like shit. Long term consequences don't matter because I'll only be around for a little longer. I just want to live recklessly for a bit first. I think the things I haven't gotten to experience yet are all that's keeping me around anymore. I'm tired of always feeling like I'm waiting for something, so I'm going to stop caring and do everything I want to get done while I'm still here, and then I can just get it all over with."
my last 20mins,20mins till train arrives. Ama
Are these suicidal thoughts?,"So I gave birth just over a year ago and started showing signs on depression during my pregnancy (was under a lot of stress in my personal life) and had a traumatic birth experience. I developed postpartum anxiety and PTSD and depression but have always been more anxious then depressed but the last few weeks I've felt more depressed, just feeling really stuck in my job and exhausted and hopeless and overwhelmed. I would never actually do it, honestly I don't think I'm brave enough too, and also I love my family and usually my life. And lately when I'm feeling really exhausted and anxious about how I'm going to get my shit together all of a sudden I'll imagine myself drinking a bottle of bleach or swallowing a bottle of pills or getting hit by a car. Like I'd never kill muself but I wish I could escape my life sometimes, almost like have something happen to me so I can escape my life and not worry about anything for awhile. I work in healthcare. I'm just so tired of being haunted by my birth still and always being so tired from working overnights and having a baby and a husband who's also depressed so I feel guilty ever asking him for more help or too afraid to tell him my darkest thoughts. I go to therapy but I've been afraid to bring it up or not sure if I should or to my doctor. I don't know :/"
Suicidal after fianc̩ left,"Me and my fianc̩ were together for over a year . He was my best friend in the whole world !!!! Everything about him was so beautiful . His eyes, the way he laughed, his humor, even the way he danced silly at clubs. He treated me like a queen at the beginning of our relationship and praised the ground I walked on . Our sex was AMAZING and to this day I have never found someone that knew my body as well as he did. We had the perfect relationship, and our friends envied us because we were so god damn happy . But Overtime, we started to grow apart. We argued like cats and dogs, and he often ignored me toward the end of our relationship. We split about two months ago, and I have been feeling suicidal ever since . I am 25 years old . My entire life I have never met anyone so perfectly compatible for me and I don't think I ever will . My heart feels like it went through a meat grinder, and it's hard to get up in the morning, go to work, get dressed or even breathe . What's worse is that he is happily living his life, not giving two shi*s about me ... so what's the point of living life if you have to live it alone ??.I just want this pain to end . People say I will get through it, but I really just cannot bare this pain I'm feeling . Death would be so great right about now :)"
"Considering killing myself, the depression just keeps strangling me.","I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, since i was a little kid i've been this way. This winter my abusive girlfriend left me and i still can't get over her completely. The weekenid i had now was the best in such a long time, the issue is that i met a girl and i felt attracted to her, she's too young tho, only 18 and i'm in my late 20s and i feel shame for that. Nothing happened between us, we barely spoke but we were in the same company over the weekend and i had a great time but now the weekend is over and same old shit week after week continues. It's like a post-great-weekend-depression on top of my regular depression that i somewhat can hande most days. I hate that i can't have fun without going into deeper depressions afterwards, i don't know why that happens and yeah, feeling this attraction to a 18 year old girl is shit aswell."
"Is it weird that, helping other people.... helps me?","I get a sort of, ""high"" or ""rush"" from helping other people, I know it sounds really corny but at the same time it makes you feel better about yourself. I just want to help everybody, but you cant save everyone. :("
A ridiculous story about our virginity.,"This is a very weird and unbelievable story, but that's because it will lack context in a way.
And that's because I have to censor a certain important detail of this story. My story is actually longer than this, so it's shortened.  I've... always dreamt of having a relationship and having sex. I dreamt of having sex every day and night.
At age 10, I already had weird fantasies and such. I was always attracted to fictional characters and dreamt of them a lot.
So at age 15, almost 16, when it was Valentinesday I got a partner. I was happy, but I had to really focus on her in my life. She... needed me, in a way. I was so busy it was so hard to love her, but I did my best.
To this day, I'd still take a bullet for her. She's so important that I choose to suffer with her. Remember that, because that'll be relevant later. Also, I'll explain what it means first.
When she can't go to a restaurant with me, I just won't go.
When I step on her feet accidentally, I step on mine.
When it's raining and I know she's outside not protected from the rain, I won't protect my self from the rain either.
It's... just things like that.
So, we didn't have sex until later in our relationship because I just wasted for the right moment. When we're both fully sexually mature, so when we're fully grown. It was only limited to me fingering her, giving her oral and me receiving oral.
It's fun, but it did miss something... I didn't think much of it, we'll have PiV sex some day. We both weren't really ready for it as it's a bit too intense for the both of us.
Doesn't matter, we'll just have other sexual contact in the mean time. Yes, I was super optimistic about it.
I was 100% sure that it would happen some day. And honestly, I'm more of a pessimist always.
I expect the worst, but I put all my optimism in this because I was excited for it.
Life went fine in a way. I had minor depressions and sometimes small mental breakdowns and such.
Sometimes I tried having sex with her, but it just couldn't work. That's when the bad evening hit...
I was  envious of others and I was seriously pissed. Life was sometimes hard for me in a way, and I've had a bit of a trauma in the past.
And I think this was the last straw in a way.
I became very depressed that evening, but I still had a lot of optimism. I've asked for advice and tried it.
That evening, she was really into it. I... failed like usual.
The problem is, my dick is too big for her. Or rather, I hate to say it because it seems like I'm blaming her body, but her vagina just happens to be really small.
I don't even have a big sized dick, I think. Not that I ever wanted a big dick anyways, for me that always seemed like an useless achievement.
That night, she really didn't like the fact that I couldn't do it. I felt ashamed and felt sad for the both of us.
She was really pushy for me to try it again, but I just wanted to sleep.
Slowly my optimism drained quickly during these months. I don't know the name of my depression, but apparently it worsens over time and we both feel it.
I also became more envious. Everytime I failed, I just had some kind of mental breakdown. I was crying so much.
During these months I also got more and more information because I've asked others. They were all nice and trying to be helpful, but their behavior towards me changed. They started insulting me because of how absolutely ridiculous this was.
They were mad at me, and they have emotionally hurt me so much. I have never felt so bad in my life.
I swear, I am still filled with hatred what they said. I depended on a guy because he tried to ''help'' me like he said, but at the end of every message he said: ''Well, I got to go now, there's an angel waiting in my bedroom.''
This his way of saying: ''I have what you don't, hahaha.'' I begged for him to stop, but I depended on him so I still tried to listen, yet he kept doing it until I blocked him.
Nobody had hurt me so much in my life. Not even my mother, who is absolutely horrible to everyone in the house.
Really, it's worse than you think it is. Everyday I think of him. I have never been so hurt by anything.
I would prefer to be stabbed or even raped. I genuinely felt suicidal because of him.
I can't take it, why do all the bad humans get the good things? I've never done anything wrong.
Trough all these months I have been trying EVERYTHING I could. Yet a whole group told me I don't even deserve it.
I am so fucking envious of him. I'd do  (but hurt my girl) to be in his situation...
There's also one thing I have to live with. My girl will die of a disease she has in a few years.
That means I will live longer than her. Even if they admitted it was gross of them to say, they told me to wait to have sex for my next partner.
But that's not even my goal. It's my goal to have sex with her, not anyone else. Even if you gave me the hottest partner, I would decline. Not even for infinite money.
I am envious of every couple I see as I know 100% they can have sex. I get pissed by every time sex gets mentioned. I get more depressed every day.
This is important, I also do this for her. This isn't just lust, I want her to experience it too. That's why I will never have sex with anyone else.
Remember this whole ''I suffer with her'' thing? If she dies a virgin, I will too. That said, when she dies... I'll end myself.
Every other couple can do this together, yet we can't. That alone may have just triggered this whole thing.
Sex is special, it's something you just don't miss in your life time. And think about it, dying a virgin is probably one of the worst things to ever happen.
You'll miss out on something that many couples do together for fun so much. We only have one life and missing this is just so sad.
Nobody deserves this fate, absolutely no one.
I really do not see her as a sex object, I love every part of her. Her personality, her body, her movements, her everything. It's just that I'm hit with these curses.
First, we can't have sex together. Second, for some reason sex is important to us, especially to me the most.
My depression is really serious. I have become aggressive and don't enjoy anything anymore. Absolutely
If you're still confused why it's so important. Sometimes, you just think something is important.
There's a lot of humans who will tell you this when your animal dies: ''It's just an animal, get a new one.'' It's kind of like this.
We all value different things. And let me remind you, it's done against our will.
I... honestly don't want to leave my girl alone in this world. But if I found a gun, the urge to end myself immediately would be great.
I really care for her, but my life feels so shit and unlucky that I can't take it anymore. I've always been paranoid and fearful, so I don't dare to kill myself in another way.
I just wish we could both have our moment just once. If we had it just once, I'll be grateful forever. That is all I want.
Surgery won't work because she doesn't want to be changed as she's afraid of it, and I myself have no idea how to even have such a surgery happen to myself.
...And one thing, I can't tell anyone about this. About everything I just said, I mean.
She isn't mentally ill as proven by the doctors here, yet it's still in the files because there was a mistake. It had something to do with her disease that'll kill her in a few years. According to a very strict law in where I live, I am not allowed to have sex with her nor be in a relationship with her.  I... am just sick of life. I just want us to have our happy little moment, that's all.
My goal is so fucking simple yet I don't get it even though I spent so much energy, optimism and time into it. Yet everyone else does it effortlessly.
I am no longer optimistic and I hate absolutely every human. I don't really want to live any more.
I just... I just wanted that one minute of easy happiness together... That is all.
Just because all of this, I have a worsening depression ruining both of our lives. It affects my whole mind.
It feels like it affects my intelligence, I lose the ability to read sometimes, even. I go crazy from time to time...
I am suicidal because of our lack of quality in our lives.  Please, let me make something sure again. I'm not a selfish fuck who's just horny.
That said, this also affected my libido. I lost the interest in sex for a while completely.
I don't even try having sex with her any more. We're beating a dead horse.
I care about her in a non-sexual way, it's just unfortunate for me that it holds so much value to me.
And if we ever had sex, I wouldn't even care if I never had sex again. I just want the experience with her  and that's it.
I want us both to experience it. She needs to enjoy it and I will.
But no... just like everything in life, luck fucks me over. Sounds edgy and kind of makes you cringe, but if luck was a human... I'd do everything to torture this piece of shit.
We don't deserve this. I was happy and optimistic once.   "
My life is more than a mess and at this point I see no other way out than suicide,"So basically my life is in shit and I've been in so much pain for a while. For the last 4 years I've been in a massive depression, and it was all leading up with my bad childhood, where my mother died when I was 8 and I had to live with my non loving dad for 10 years, until I was 18 - When I was 18 I moved out to live by myself and honestly it has been so tough, I have lived by myself for 4 years now. But as I moved out I also found the love of my life, but she didn't find me, so I've been struggling with a hard depression for all that time, which has led me to end my studies several times and do nothing. This made me not get any income and made me end up getting some stupid loans I can't pay back as well as being kicked out of my apartment soon because I can't pay the rent. I've just totally lost the will to live and I can't see a way to turn my life around or fix it at this point and I just feel like some things just can't be fixed and aren't meant to be... Where I am one of those things. I could go into a lot more detail, but this is just a short version of it. By continuing to live I will just end up with more pain, more debt and no place to live. Feel free to leave your thoughts, that's why I'm writing here after all"
"Recurring nightmare, i can't remember when i lost whatever i had left but it won't matter tomorrow","They say everything happens for a reason right? Butg i can't get this fucking itchy static scratchy feeling out of my skull and when i close  my eyes i see the exact same face imprinted on the back of my eyelids, it's garfield, he's pulling the skin taut around his ((im not joking)) genital area and his whole body is shaking and his breath is hitching and i just dont know what its supposed to mean but i have 20 olanzapine and 4 bottles of calpol in the kitchen cupboard, don't bother replying with bullshit excuses for why i should keep breathing because i died a long time ago already. Goodbye."
"I'm happy, but what difference does that make?","I'm happy. I feel better than I've ever done before. I get help, I get proper medication and I feel satisfied with where I'm going in life. I have found meaning and purpose and joy in living! But really... what difference does it make? Last weekend something happened to me. I collapsed at a party and ended up at the hospital. The doctors think I got drugged. It was traumatic and horrible. I was scared and in pain, but most importantly I was so ashamed. I have a history of losing it when I get drunk and it is common knowledge that I really shouldn't be drinking. Yet here I was... at a party, drinking. Before this event i'd been sober for a few months and I know I shouldn't have gone out, but my friends convinced me and before I collapsed I actually had quite a good time. Now, this ""incident"" only convinced me even more to stay sober and to not drink, but I really can't stop blaming myself for what happened. They say I was drugged but it must have been my fault somehow. Mostly because that's what my friends keep telling me...I live in a big apartment with two of my friends, both of them were present when I collapsed. Anyway, they have decided to kick me out. Because of what happened at that party. They don't want to be responsible for me when (not if, when) these things happen. They say it ruins their own happiness to constantly worry and take care of me. That I'm a time bomb and a risk. Dangerous and depressing. Now, as I mentioned at the very beginning I am in a really good place in my life so I didn't really understand what they were saying. They don't need to worry. What happened was an accident (right? maybe it wasn't?) and I will not drink again, I don't want to! But they do not believe me. They say they believe that I WANT to stop drinking and get better, but that I won't be able to. Just a few months ago I was a total mess. I was unemployed, I had no money, I lived isolated and alone, I couldn't afford food so I only ate 2-3 times/week, I partied all the time, did drugs and frequently hurt myself and others. Then I did what everyone expected me to do, I tried to kill myself. Obviously I didn't succeed and I ended up at the hospital instead. That's when I decided to turn my life around and start living. And I did! I decided to move back home to the countryside, I stopped drinking, got proper psychiatric help and a diagnosis (BPD). I started taking care of myself and applied for classes at the university. All of a sudden I could see myself living a long, happy life. Anyway... I came back to the city to study. (So far I love it. Very happy about it) Moved into this great apartment with my friends. Went to one (one!) party, things went to hell and now apparently I am too. To get to the point: I'm now homeless (again) and have nowhere to go. I feel as if I will never be able to outrun my former mistakes. No matter what I do, no matter how good I might feel, I will always be seen as a disaster and a problem. Right now nothing makes any sense and absolutely everything feels hopeless and meaningless, despite the fact that I'm happy and on the right track in life. It feels like I can't do anything right. Like I will forever be judged by who I once was. I really don't think I can handle getting torn down and having to build myself up one more time. It feels like I've done it a billion times already. I'm just so tired... I really don't see the point in fighting for myself again when it obviously doesn't really make a difference. I think about killing myself and it feels okay. It feels like the only reasonable thing to do. It is what everyone expects anyway, and they're probably right... it doesn't matter what I do or who I become, I should just go ahead and end it already. I am 19 years old and I have already ruined everything. I ruin everything for everyone. I'm a problem and a burden and I must die. I must die so everyone I ever knew can be happy. I must disappear and vanish and go away. I can't make any sound, I can't be seen, I am disgusting and a disgrace. Death is the only thing for me. I have to kill myself. I have to I have to. I can see it in everyone's eyes, that they want me gone. I feel so sorry for ever taking up all this space and wasting all this time. I feel so sorry and I feel so dirty and I feel so heavy. Please please please let me die this time."
I don't think I can live in this world anymore,"I'm sick of being alive in a world where nobody accepts me for who I am or understands me. I'm sick of being hated and being constantly told that I'm worthless or that I deserve to die because I have a form of autism. I'm sick of trying to open up about my struggles and not being listened to, rather just blindly hated on and again, told that I'm worthless and should die. I'm sick of being bullied and physically and verbally attacked constantly for being different. Most of all, I'm sick of my parents not giving a shit about any of this, they think I'm a terrible person as well. I just want to fucking die, I can't stand living in this world where everybody hates me (or would hate me if they met me). Tonight, I'm going to go to bed, and suffocate myself to death with my pillow, my parents will spend the whole night thinking I'm actually sleeping for once."
It's getting harder and harder for me to justify living,"I'm not normalI'm self-conscious I have low self-esteemI can't make friendsI have no friends and the only contacts in my phone book are my mom, grandmother, brother, and step-dad. But the only one I talk to regularly is my momI can't talk to people in real time it terrifies me - I can't do it on the phone, I can't do it through text, I can't do it through micI can't go to crowded places because I think everyone will look at me because I'm alone
I can't cross streets because I think everyone is staring at meI can't eat alone because I think everyone is staring at meI can't exercise because I think everyone is staring at meI can't go to buffet style restaurantsI can't eat alone because I think I'll stand out and because of this I haven't even gone to my college's cafeteria because I don't know how it works and I'm too scared to ask how it works at this point and I haven't really eaten because of itI've tried to think about what made me this way and I've pointed to a few reasons - being bullied up to high school, my mom being a lot meaner and unstable before she got on medication and met my step-dad, being compared to my brother by everyone before we went to different schools, and being ignored by family because they favored him more.
But I'm also aware that those happened in the past and I should work to try to fix the problems they caused rather than blame everyone else for my own inability to fix the problemsI know how to fix the problem - I start small by crossing streets or something similar and once I get used to that.I try something else like small talk with a stranger or classmate and just tell myself ""Who cares if they think you're weird!"" if I get nervousThen I move onto getting their number if things go well. Maybe I text them or they text me maybe the same day or maybe tomorrow who knows.
Then we get closer and ask each other out once in awhile and then I made a friendIf I do it enough I'll get comfortable with it and then I will be able to make more friends and even a girlfriend and I'll be partway to a dream I had since I was a child: becoming a husband, father, and a teacher that everyone could admireI thought going to college would be able to fix all of my problems because it's a new place and I researched this for a really long time, but it didn't I am too scared to do anything. I haven't even went to the
cafeteria yet because I don't know how to use it I thought I'd be able to make friends at a party the college hosted on move-in day, but everyone was already in a group or paired up, so I wasn't able to work up the courage to talk to anyone and left quickly
I don't understand how everyone was able to make friends so quickly. I hear people talk outside my window having fun and talking with friends and it makes me feel like a complete life because I'm not doing that even though I want to
I'm thinking of going to a club fair tomorrow, but I probably won't do that either knowing meI've been on multiple anti-anxiety pills and I've been in therapy since I was 8 or 9 and I done both for 10 years.
My mom swears up and down that they worked, but I told her they didn't and she even admitted at one point that they made me more ""Zombie"" likeMy mom and brother try to help me, but they just get frustrated and annoyed when it doesn't work out and
then they yell (raising their voices in their own words) at me when I say I knew it wouldn't work and I know
how to solve all of my problems and it's a me problem at this point and if I can't do it then it doesn't matter
how often you yell at me or give me suggestions or just give me the horrible (""JUST DO IT"") motto even though I've said time and time again that it's horrible and it's a lot harder than that for meIt just isn't working because I'm in the equation. It's all because of meI know it will take a couple of months to fix all of this, but I can't do it. I can't work up to courage to talk to people, I can't get it into my head that most people aren't looking at me and judging my every move and I can't get it into my head that most people will probably forget about me in a couple of hours
Instead my mind loops to all of the negative thoughts and outcomes and I get reminded about how scared I am of people
I remember back to stuff I read online the last time I talked about this: I only want a girlfriend/wife because I want sex, I can't even cross a street so I'm beyond help, I have low-self esteem because I'm biracial and I'm pracitally a mutt, and many other things which make me question myself and makes me even more scared of talking to people I already am scared of talking toI've been thinking about suicide a lot since New Years lately and I finally told my brother and mom when my brother came back from college and before I left for college and all my brother does is punch me and say don't say that. My mom's the same way when I talk about suicide, but instead gets mad and says never talk about that again. There are only three things stopping me from committing suicide really My cat who is almost 13 at this point and the fact someone told me I wouldn't be happy if I killed myself because I wouldn't be able to feel happiness. And the possibility of things getting better and finally achieving my dreamHowever those things are becoming less and less of a suicide stopper because I know even if I die my family will take care of my cat and the fact that I realized I wouldn't be able to feel sadness if I died either. Researching the problem doesn't helpAsking for help doesn't helpMedicine doesn't helpPeople can't help meI can't help myself anymore and I really am reaching the final straw at this point. It's getting hard for me to continue justifying this existence where all I do is hide from people and live out my dreams in my head because I'm too scared to talk and do anything"
I think I'm going to kill myself soon.,"My whole life is shit, and it's all due to my pathetic nature.  I've got a chronic illness that makes me miserable.  I've missed so much work due to it and depression I'm likely to lose my job this week.  I have no friends and no one who cares about me.  People only get in contact with me when they need something.  I'm in a large amount of debt, have no college degree, and no career prospects. I've never had a romantic relationship or anything similar.  I look ugly, and even when I was fit I was unable to attract anyone.  People tell me I'm funny and tell me  I'm a nice person, but apparently that hasn't been enough.All all I'm just a waste of space on this Earth and it would be better off without me.  At least then my insurance company won't have to pay an arm and a leg every month for my stupid medicines.  I wish I could fix my life, but deep down I know things would turn out this way anyway, because I'm too pathetic to amount to anything.  I wish I could apologize to the people who expected things from me when I was younger.  Now I'm almost 30 and a complete failure.Every evening I fantasize about killing myself, and every time I get closer to doing it.  Finally I am at the point where I've started planning logistically.  Hopefully I can donate most of my stuff before I bite the bullet."
I hope I don't wake up tomorrow,I mixed alcohol with pain killers after realizing what a pathetic person I am. I feel so dizzy and numb right now. I hope that to tomorrow I wake up in another world. A world that leaves me alone. I will never change and never be a good person. No matter what happens. I hope I die. If anyone reads this - I just wanted to say that I tried.
end my life pls,"I hate living, I just wanna be dead, I don't wanna exist someone please just kill me. Run me over, burn me, shoot me, drown me, just whatever it takes for me to die. Please kill me I'm done living. It'll make me happy, I can't wait any longer. Ima commit suicide next year on June or July I can't wait that long it's too much, time passes so slowly I hate it so much I hate living. I wanna die so fucking badly"
im lost in a sea of lament,"I'm tired of feeling like my life is a damn game.  I lost the girl who i loved most in the world.  We were doing so good and then all of a sudden we split.  My heart is shattered in a trillion pieces and i don't know what to do.  She motivated me so much and gave me happiness that i never had before.  She was the one.  I knew she was but now i won't ever get her back bc i fucked up so bad.  I started smoking and drinking and i know i shouldn't be doing that.  My dad is an alcoholic and a druggy, so i don't wanna end up like him.  But ever since me and her split, she hasn't been treating me well at all.  We didn't want to split originally, her mom made her do it.  But she's already starting to get with another guy and it's not even been a day.  I feel so betrayed and crushed.  She said what we had was real and she went and turned her back on me.  She's acting like it's all my fault that we'll never get back together.  I've never been so low in my life.  I've lost all hope for love.  Nobody treats me like a human anymore.  I'm just a fucking game to people.  Like they can always fucking play me.  Nobody respects me or let alone give a damn about my well being.  I fucking hate life and I just want to die.  I'm so tired of suffering.  I feel like there isn't anything to look forward to.  I've been brought down to my knees and nothing can ever get me to stand up again.  I lost my friends, my self esteem, my motivation, my love, my everything.  I want to die.  I'm tired of drowning in this ocean of suffering and sadness..."
I feel like Rodney Dangerfeild,"Because I get no respect from anybody. I can't tell if it's because of my small stature, social awkwardness, ugly face, or all of those things combined. No matter what I do, most people just don't seem to...really even like me. I could try to connect/hit it off with one person, fail, then watch them talk to someone else a second later and they get along swimmingly. Idk what it is. It's especially a problem with girls/women. Young or old, I seem to be female-repellent, despite the fact that I don't feel anxiety around them. I'm just trying to be my normal self, but apparently there's something wrong with that. I kind of get along well with other dudes, but I can't make ""true"" friends and I just never get any respect from them. Idk it's like I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I'd like to think it's nothing, because I value myself, but no one else really does. They just call me ""buddy"" and ""dude"" condescendingly and generally fail at treating me like an adult. Idk. It mostly sucks with women because it seems I can't attract any of them and I place a lot of value on being able to do that, because I find at it's heart the ability to attract women has a lot to do with your social ability and humanity, and I just can't seem to pull it off. It's got me so down to be honest. I'll admit, so down that I think I'd rather die than be this socially-incapable.   "
I can't function in the real world. I'm thinking about ending it.,"I desperately need some advice or something to keep me going. I'm at a very low point in my life. I'm 23 and going to a community college at the moment but I'm starting to lose my desire to continue with my life. I screwed up when I was younger and now my gpa is low and non competitive. This pretty much eliminates my prospects to get into a good undergraduate school or a grad school as I am competing with other students who don't have the mental and emotional problems that I have and who are passionate and excelling at what they are doing. I have major social anxiety so I can't talk to anyone like a normal human being so I can't make any kind of connections or companions. I have no idea about what to do with my life. I don't contribute anything meaningful to my family. My family loves me regardless but unfortunately that's not helping me in my prospects. I'm lazy and scared all the time and have been fantasizing about my death for a while now. I've been through therapy, taken anti depressants, nothing is working. I'm still terrified of competition, terrified of talking to people and I'm not smart either. All it takes is a bullet to be lodged in my head, less than a second and it will all be over."
In hospital.,"I'm in a foreign hospital getting treatment for my recent suicide attempt.I really hate myself for this. I didn't go through with it because I upset my partner so much but all I feel I did was force her to stay when she didn't want to. I was all intent on doing it, on stopping bringing her down, and then she begged me not to and I convinced myself she cared and checked in, got stitched up and now I'm here a few days later. Except I think she just felt guilty and didn't want it on her conscience. I don't think she really wanted me alive. I think she just didn't want the guilt and I feel terrible. All I did was what I did as a teenager, threaten suicide and told as many people as possible I was gonna do it so they'd all feel guilty. I haven't improved at all. I'm a fucking child.  A brat. A horrible brat. I wanted to end my life as an aggressive and hurtful thing. Not because I wanted to end my life (although I did and still do). I'm all stitched up and heavily monitored. I'm 26, my hair is falling out, I'm a recovering addict... I've just got nothing to show for my life and when I'm given the chance to do something, I try and kill myself instead of doing it. It's pathetic. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm an anorexic, abused (as a child), broken, wannabe Junkie and I'm scum. I think I ruin so many lifves by existing. My mom didn't want me, ever and I don't think my partner does either. She puts a brave face on but I can tell. I'm a friend, who's death she didn't want to haunt her. "
Suicide by Cop Fantasy,I'm desperate. I want to escape this shit existence.And when I get like this I like to fantasize my own demise.  I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. Are cops trained to shoot to kill? I wouldn't want to mentally hurt a police officer (or police officers if more then one is called to the scene) but I feel it's apart of their training to potentially take a life. I fantasize about a group of them just shooting me to death. I fantasize about aiming a black spray painted water pistol at them and them responding by spending their entire magazines on me. I fantasize about having my suicide note zipped up in two ziplock bags so that it's legible after the fountain of blood coming from me dousing it.The fantasy of this actually makes me feel a lot better.
I have never felt lower.,I got dumped and I don't know why. I want to die.
What is so wrong about committing suicide?,"I can't seem to see why suicide is inherently wrong in so many cultures. If I no longer want to be in this world, then why should I be pressured to stay? I feel like I'm not contributing much to society this way, anyway."
"Struggling, a bit","If I were more rational, I think I would be in a better place right now. I go to a top-tier school, and I�۪m on track to finish my degree in a year. Despite these accomplishments, I still feel like an utter failure. I don�۪t enjoy my majors, and I feel as if I�۪m living a life that has been projected onto me. I�۪m Asian American, and while I can go on long-winded tangents on how much I think the model minority myth is bullshit, I still feel ridiculously burdened and pressured by it. I don�۪t have a great relationship with my parents, but I still have that desperate need to obtain a certain ���success�۪ that is by their terms. I am ���successful�۪ by their terms, but for this I�۪ve sacrificed my mental health, happiness, social life, and so many experiences that I can�۪t relive. As a caveat��� I have been suicidal in the past. While I am struggling right now, I certainly am not at my lowest point. I got a bit drunk after hearing about DACA and am just a crumpled up napkin of a mess right now. "
How do you know if you're suicidal?,"I've thought about killing myself and I'd truly rather be dead than alive. I'm scared of doing it though, but I feel like I have nothing to live for. Is this considered suicidal? I don't know if I need help or not."
I tried to help a friend in need and now it drained all the life out of me.,"Just a note I have a cup full of bourbon that I am sipping now. I don't drink normally.A friend I knew for at least 7 years I found out was/is in dire straights. She has been in and out of in patient treatment/ out patient treatment, therapy, psychiatrist. She contacted me about a month ago to visit her at her parents house. I relented and went, she wanted to move back to the major city she was, she moved back to her parents when shit hit the fan. She wanted to go back to life. I tried to help her but I myself have been depressed for many years >15 but I never told her. ~4 years ago though my brother was murdered by a drunk driver. Somehow I survived that to be stronger but I lost my ability to feel and show emotion. I tried to help her because she was in bad shape and felt that if I did not reach out she might actually kill herself. So her mother and I worked out a plan and she moved back. I guess this is important as well. She was in a 3 year relationship with a guy as well but he left her because even he got sick of it. But he still occasionally texts her.I tried to help her as a friend. I did not particularly want to be in a relationship with her but as I spent more and more time I started to feel again and it hit me like a ton of bricks waking up from the stupor that I have been in since my brother died.I stupidly suggested that she go to a indie movie at a film festival with me to try to get her out of the house. When she moved into the large city she became a shut in. Since the place the movie was shown was a few hours away someone suggested that they stay over their place. She started to warm up and started to be the person I remembered her to be. She allowed me to feel happy and she was happy and somehow that's when I started to have feelings for her.She wanted to go visit her mother this labour day weekend and I off handedly said maybe I would go again. She took that as a yes and told her mother before I could take it back. I go up there, she immediately turns sour. She changed, I am not sure. Weirdly I hung out with her mother more while she became reclusive in her bedroom. Her mother had these arts and crafts for her to do but she didn't want to but her mother and I did them while she sulked in her bedroom. She got to a point where we were supposed to head back sunday but she said to me, I think you should go back by yourself and I will stay with my mother. Her mother was telling me to bring her back. She then professes her love for her ex boyfriend when she realizes I started to have feelings because I slipped and mentioned that ""I enjoyed spending time with her"" the day prior.I tried to keep my mouth shut about that and she kept pestering me to say what I was not saying. I kept telling her I would tell her later hoping she would forget. She would stand in front of her doorway not allowing me to leave. I told her after she basically forced me to tell her that I started to have feelings for her. I was going to try and suppress them and really try to get her back to her normal self. This was a problem that I was going to sort out with myself and did not want to burden her from getting better.I just got home from the 4 hour drive from her parent's house. I texted her as she requested when I got home. I said I can't do it anymore and asked her not to contact me again. She tried to but doesn't realize that I already blocked her. I knew I was playing a dangerous game and everyone got burned. I was in an okay spot and she didn't realize she drained me everything. Its been at least 2-3 years since I've had these sw feelings. I am not going to but damn if the ideology looks mighty tempting tonight.Someone please say anything. I know I fucked up too. Someone say I fucked up."
'Why don't you just kill yourself?',"The title is something I think every day. I've fantasied about dying every day since I was 16 (so about 9 years now), often involving a lot of blood and chaos like being shot in the head with a high powered sniper rifle in public. Thing is, i don't think I'd ever do it simply because of the repercussions it would have to my friends and family, but my god, do I ever want to. I'm pretty good these days, but it's very easy to slip and have a bad day. I don't even really know why I'm writing this - venting I suppose. If you're ever thinking about killing yourself, something weirdly comforting I think of is: the choice is between living through some slightly shitty (but a lot of good!) times or just nothingness. You're going to get to the nothingness anyway, so why not enjoy the living parts until you simply can't? Yeah. "
My friend asked me a question.,"The other day, my friend asked me a question while I was driving us home from band practice. He said, what do you think we'll all be doing in 20 years? Do you think that we'll all still be friends, or do you think we'll just be a bunch of strangers at a high school reunion? The only answer I had for him was ""I think you know what I think""."
"Help, please. I just need someone to talk with.","Where do I even begin... Well, I'm 14, and I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I've been self harming for a few years. I've felt so... Empty, lately. I guess I should talk about the main reasons of my depression, huh? For one, my brother is constantly telling me to ""kill yourself"" and ""I fucking hate you"". My sister also hates me, and she can't even tell me she loves me. I don't remember the last time either of them remotely showed affection for me. Then, my mother. She knows that I self harm and that I'm severely depressed, but she really doesn't care. Whenever I'm found self harming, she says ""you need more God in your life"" or something like that. (Me being agnostic, that doesn't help at all). Recently, she's been threatening me with ""you keep this up, I'll sent you to the mental ward"". She doesn't bother trying to help me, or anything. In fact, she's said that I have nothing to be depressed aboutLet's talk about me some, okay? Recently, I've been feeling really ugly. I look at myself in the mirror and just... Gawk at how ugly I am. I can't bring myself to stand up straight, and I don't like eating a whole lot. Not helping this, I don't get the best grades in school, no matter how hard I try, and also get bullied, and bully myself,  both physically and mentally.Now, the only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend, who lives in Texas. I live in New York. I only live so we can have a future. She's been literally the best thing to ever happen to me, and me and her have a ton in common. We've never even seen each other's faces, but that's the problem. I'm afraid she'll repulse when she sees me, and that's why I'm scared. I'm not even living for myself anymore, I'm living for her.I don't even know what to do anymore. Idk if it's worth it, trying to put up with the agony that I call life. Please, just talk with me. That's all I want.(Update) I've been looking around this subreddit and I just feel worse about myself. My mom is right, I have nothing to be depressed over. All of these people are going through so much more, and my life isnt the best rn, and I'm whining like a little bitch over it. I'm wasting space on this planet, maybe somebody better will take my place.(Another update) I haven't been as depressed as i was originally , but I have been really lonely lately. Haven't seen my girlfriend or my friends in about a week, I'm just sitting on my ass doing nothing all day until I go to sleep and repeat that (Update 2.5) Soon after the last update, my loneliness has turned into anger. I'm now fucking pissed at myself because I want to do so much more with myself but I just cant"
I hate.myself,"28 , I hate myself so much , I'm running out of ability to pretend , I'm starting to plan , I don't know what to do"
Im gonna do it.,"Ive had enough, as soon as I get a chance to kill myself I will take it."
I had an abortion and dont want to wake up,"Im not expecting to gain sympathy by posting this. I dont have any sympathy for myself.  I just dont have anyone to talk to in my life out of fear of being judged. I am older, 38. This was my 1st time being pregnant. I was 7 weeks and terminated my pregnancy 1 week ago w a medical abortion. I was with my ex about a year, we were having problems and had broken up a few weeks before i found out. At 38, i thought i missed my chance at being a mom. In a new relationship, my bf at time stated he wanted to eventually try and have one child. At the time i became pregnant i was not trying.  I realized we had sex in that fertile window, even bought plan b. For whatever reason i left it in my car n went away for a few days for work. I didnt repurchase it. It was not an intelligent move on my part. I told my brothers and a 2 friends of my pregnancy, not thinking abortion was even an option at the time. My ex shocked me, he was furious and stated i was ruining his life, and having this baby would be a really bad choice . I am an adult, and have a decent job w security. I couldve had support of my family and a few close friends. I dont want to play a victim,  regardless of his reaction i am the one who chose to go through w this.  And what a mistake it has been. I was scared and overwhelmed.  But now i feel hopeless, guilt, and just empty. I have blocked my friends texts and calls because i cannot face telling them. I have dreams that the abortion didnt work, and that i could still have this baby. I dont know how to keep living right now. N i cant help but feeling like this was a gift to be a mom. At my age i doubt I'll have opportunity again. N i just threw this gift away. I wish i could go to sleep and not wake up. Thank you for reading this."
When I feel alive,"It's been a rough couple of months.My (19F) dad's income was cut by 30%, my friend died after a surgery a couple weeks ago, I got my heart broken by my best guy friend/crush, my L5 disc is bulging and causing agonizing sciatica, I started a new job and one of my coworkers makes a point to pick on me, I haven't slept more than four hours a night for the past month, and a boy from my gym killed himself.I've been suicidal for years, and all this stress has made the urges worse.However, through all this, there is a light. I found something to crave and live for.On my birthday, I went skydiving. And holy shit; I have never felt so alive.The high lasted the whole day. I was just beaming. I haven't felt so amazing in a long time.For all 60 seconds of free fall, I couldn't think about ANYTHING. It was so peaceful. It was like a mental detox.I'm starting my AFF to get my skydiving license this week, and I am so excited. I have dreams now. I think about skydiving all day. I think about how I'll save up for my jumps and equipment. I think about how I'll make a career out of it, or work a career around it. I've finally found the thing that will keep me alive----more than alive. "
Need motivation to clean before the end,"I don't want to leave behind a bunch of crap when I'm gone. My family had to spend three straight months selling my grandmother's stuff. I'm not putting my family through that again.I bought some crap in what you could call a fit of shopping therapy, back when I didn't realize I eventually become this suicidal. Unfortunately, what I bought was obscure, rare stuff I can't just dump in the Goodwill. I went to sell it and leave behind money people can actually use.The thought of putting the energy into eBay listings and wait extended periods of times to finalize the sales makes me ill. And there are several items. I just want this to be over with. I barely have the energy to make this post."
passively suicidal - past failed attempts,"I guess I'm just searching for some support here... I went through a period of active suicidal behaviour for 1-2 years which exhausted me to the point where I felt like I couldn't face attempting it again. Unfortunately the thoughts still haven't left, and I only feel regret that I wasn't successful. I feel very detatched and numb all the time, and unable to get the motivation to actually act on these feelings (for now) but I really wish I wasn't here. My mental health team barely see me anymore because I'm not on medication (it just made me worse) and I guess they see me as less of a threat to myself. The trouble is, every day is a struggle and I just want it to end. I don't know where to go for support because the hospital won't care unless I'm psychotic or have overdosed and I'm still resentful for them forcing treatment on me to reverse my last overdose. I feel like I wasn't given a choice and then after a few days they sent me home and made me feel like everything was supposed to be ok now. I feel like I might as well be dead."
It's not as simple as wanting it,"I'm useless. I'm a lazy motherfucker, which means the myriad of other problems I have are unsolvable, because I refuse to work.But there's nothing more frustrating than being told ""Just do it"". Oh boy, thanks for totally fixing all my problems. I can't believe that all this time it was just because I didn't want to work./s.""Just have this attitude."" ""Just stop hating yourself."" ""Just love life."" "

I guess I just want to let the weight break me.,"There is no point. There is no true happiness anywhere. It's all only temporary, at least for me. Everyone is different I'm sure. I can be happy sometimes. But eventually even if it lasts for a while I break down until I see the sadness again. The sadness is always there waiting to show its head again. The sadness makes me just want to finally give up. Its like a weight on my shoulders and all I want to do is let the weight break me so I can relax. Sometimes I feel like the weight isn't so bad but eventually I realize what it really is. For a while I thought I had everything figured out. Now I know nothing about the world. How can anyone? What is the point of my life if all it is is me pretending to be happy for other people. In reality I'm sad and I want the sadness to take over, because it's so much easier than trying so hard to be happy. The happiness is only temporary anyway. Everyone is only here for their own good. It may not seem so but it's always true. Does anyone really truly care about me? Do I really truly care about anyone? Probably not. Unless I want or get something in return. It's fucked up. So no one cares about eachother yet for some reason I push through the weight on my shoulders. Why do I do that? Why can't I just let the weight break me so I can finally relax. I'm more curious to see what happens if I let it break me than I am about staying here sometimes. Sorry if anyone reads this. I'm spreading sadness. I need to know someone has read these feelings though. I can't tell anyone I know. I'd be labeled or looked at different. I'd get fake attention.. Maybe at least if anyone even cares about that. I can't say anything to anyone. I'm forced to push through it silently. Im not sure how much longer I can do that. I just want to let go of that weight and relax. And possibly finally have my true forever happiness."
I just don't know anymore...,So I just turned 24 and its almost been a year since my 5 year relationship ended and I feel completely hopeless. I feel like I've always given up my whole life on everything and the way others see me kills me inside. I want to have love for myself but I feel like I shouldn't since my relationship fell apart and I hate myself for that. Sometimes I've heard quotes about getting so worried and having life pass you by... that's where I'm at. I literally feel like losing that relationship is the worst thing that could of ever happened and I don't want to go on. I also just feel pathetic in general that this is where my life has ended up. I always told myself I actually want to help people but I can't even help myself
"Having a painic attack, gun in mouth","I've wasted my goddamed life doing nothing, i've got nothing to show for anything. Why have I neglected everything I could've done? I could start now, but the world is too competetive so it's far too late.  Death is inevitable anyways, no more alarms, early mornings, idiots, or time to worry about wasting.    "
Why do I always have breakdowns when no one is there to talk to?,"I keep having breakdowns at inconvenient times.  Like at work or in the car or late at night.  I keep going to my boyfriend for support, but after a certain time, he likes to play online with his friends.  Some of the time, he'll turn the headset off, some times he'll just uncover an ear to hear me, but I don't really get his undivided attention.  Not saying he's a jerk, cause he's not.  He's a great boyfriend and I'm so needy.  I'm so lonely.  I feel like I don't have a single friend.  I try and find someone to talk to, but no one lives very close and they are always busy or I'm working.  I'm constantly contacting people about having a chat, but hardly anyone returns my messages, let alone checks up on me.  I've been suicidal on and off since I was 11.  I wasn't socialized till I was 11 and years before that, I was sexually assaulted.  I apparently have severe depression, but the doctor, MIND, the mental health team etc have just passing me around from pillar to post, not giving me any help whatsoever.  I was meant to get cognitive behavior therapy.  I was told I had been referred urgently, but nothing has been done.  They want to dose me up with drugs, but they never help.  I'm on natural antidepressants now, but my hormones go haywire whenever it's that time of the month. I tried taking iron tablets when it's that time and that has helped a bit.  However I recently started a new job in care work and it's horrible.  I feel I need to stay a while cause it won't look good on my cv if i don't, but there's so many people all telling me different things that I should be doing.  I feel so lost and stupid and they expect me to know everything and be super fast and do the job of two people.  I'm exhausted.  I keep getting headaches from always being shouted at.  Plus I've been hit, kicked, spat at, swore at and shouted at.  One of the people literally tells me to ""f*** off and die.""  I had planned to kill myself last month, but I hung on.  But there's no point.  There's nothing here for me.  I don't know why I even try."
layed on a road,"and got put in a mental ward in hospital. It was ok at first but they really dont pay attention to you, you have to scream 500 hours just so they listen to you. and they don't let you outside or anything so on a 20 minute leave I ran off and i'm probably going to have to sleep on the street now and will probably jump off a building."
"I'm failing my university degree, I'm afraid to leave the house and I just think I'm a fat, ugly, worthless failure.","I'm struggling.
I'm actually fucking struggling to keep myself afloat.
I never wish I went to university. I'm failing all of my classes and on top of that, I have been mentally unstable for months. I feel like a complete failure because I have only one more semester left then I can finally be free, but it's just so hard. I haven't taken a break or had time off to actually focus on myself for years, and no matter how much I beg too, my family and boyfriend just tell me to keep going.
I should have taken a break after I escaped my abuse ex who used to sexually, emotionally and financially abuse me, but no one let me take time off. On top of that I want to study fashion design. I don't enjoy learning about psychology anymore especially when my only psychological wellbeing is not even close to being healthy, but I cannot leave now in fears of disappointing everyone. Why me? Why can't the pain just stop so I can finally feel like I'm a human being? I just want to die. "
Near the end...,"I am a very messed up person, I feel there is no hope for me. Most of my life I've only known pain and fear through my anxieties..

I cant believe what my life has become and who i have become. Its almost like a nightmare and I'm wishing I would just wake up from it. Please take me back to when I was a kid before everything fell into destruction.It's so scary to think back over years of my life and to not know any joy. To not know any friendships or any feelings of success or happiness. It's only ever been the same fear. Only bad memories of pure emptiness that I block out to not feel the pain.I honestly can't take this anymore, I feel like I am losing my mind, I need help.There are no options for me, I cannot be a normal functioning person in society. I simply cannot do it. Days have turned into weeks, weeks into months and months into years.. I cannot take this anymore, it has to stop..I need this consciousness to end or it will be the same over and over again, nothing but more suffering. year after year of being lost into the same darkness, I cant take it!Things are so messed up, I'm so messed up.

I'm making my plan .,"Hello, I don't really post anything on Reddit so forgive me if I get anything wrong. I'm at the end of my tether. I'm on the edge now and I feel like it's totally hopeless. I've got two young children and a husband. My marriage is a good one despite the fact that I constantly pull at the threads of it to destroy it. I'm in complete self destruct mode, I'm drinking a lot and staying out late every opportunity I get. Getting wasted is the only time I feel anything other than crippling desperation.
I'm becoming a toxic presence in the presence of everyone I love. I'm convinced now that I'm better off dead. Everyone would be better off with me gone but I'm terrified of hurting them. I've inflicted so much pain already. Now I'm trapped which is causing me to really panic, I can't kill myself without causing irreparable damage to my family, I can't bare to live another day. What do I do? Please help. "
I don't know what else to do,"Man I am just here at the moment really contemplating suicide. I am 25 years old, male, and I don't know what the fuck to do.
Just to give some background I recently started a business with my ""best friend"" about a year ago and I am the one who solely dished out about $15,000.00 on the business. Once the money became a factor in this friendship things changed drastically.
Now I am in debt with all this. And this person has turned against me and has used all the money purely for raves and money.
At this point I don't know what else to fucking do, I am just wanting to move on but it seems I still need to deal with this and i also have my own depressive episodes that this does not contribute to my well being.
At this moment I just want to talk to someone that doesn't judge me for my own mistakes. I am at the end of all this bullshit and want to fucking be done"
Planning on ending it all.,"I'm a 20 year old bisexual woman who has autism, bipolar, GAD and ADHD. I'm also a hardcore maladaptive daydreamer. On top of all that, I have very low self-esteem.Tonight I'm planning on choking myself with a belt. I have a suicide note already written to my family and I'm going to write some for my friends as well. I can't go to the hospital because my family can't afford it. My parents can't really help me because their first reaction is either ""send her to the hospital"" (which they never follow through with) or ""we don't have the money for a funeral."" So I'm pretty much screwed when it comes to getting immediate help.Please, somebody give me reason to live. Life just keeps getting worse, whether it affects me or not. I can't take it anymore. "
My friend may be suicidal. What should I do?,"I have a friend who, although I do not think is seriously contemplating suicide, talks about suicide a lot. For example, a few days ago, he said something along the lines of ""dude.. don't you sometimes feel like you want to kill yourself and everyone around you?"" to which I responded ""not particularly"". after which he said ""What about <mutual enemy>?"" to which I jokingly replied ""Okay, maybe him."" Other than that, he occasionally says things like ""the workload in AP Chem is so hard, sometimes I just want to kill myself."" While I think that he's just joking and that there's nothing to be worried about, I'm still worried, and he's been both the longest friend I've had so far and my best friend, so I'm unsure what to do. Any help? "
Stuck in unhappiness and worthlessness,"I am a bad person. I wish I would die in my sleep. I wish anyone who has ever cared for me realizes that I am just going to drag them down with my lies hiding my distaste for life or the suicidal feelings themselves. Actually ""fixing"" it takes an eternity and anyone who tries for that long is wasting their time on a worthless cause.  I will never escape, I will only feel worthless and unhappy or feeling nothing. My life doesn't have a happy ending. It is the result of the entropy of happiness. Every day I will still taste happiness, but a sliver compared to the day before it and an invisible speck compared to two days before. Is living really worth it? I am probably not going to die right now, but I am going to sleep soon and hopefully die and get replaced with someone worth other people's time and care."
Been having a hard time...,"I've had depressive episodes as long as I can remember, but lately it's been a lot worse. I've always thought that i didn't want to die, i just wanted to be dead and that killing myself was never something i could do. however, lately i've been thinking about how easy it actually would be to end it. I'm not s afraid of the act anymore and I'm not sure how to feel about it.
I tried to reach out to the suicide hotline for a few days now with no real luck. I only feel comfortable using the chat service as speaking in person really doesn't help me much, my thoughts never translate to speech. I only got connected to the actual chat once and they copy/pasted a paragraph telling me to call the hotline and then disconnected with me.
I've tried to talk to my doctor about my feelings(I've never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety), and they asked if i had lost interest in things I like doing and well, I haven't so I told her no. that was the end of that.
I'm sorry if I'm rambling too much, but I've reached out for help so many times these past years and the only response I've been getting is to tell me to reach out for help... I'm not sure what else to do, I'm kind of at the end of my rope here..."
Can someone talk with me tonight?,"Just really depressed, trying to avoid feeling suicidal, and talking and connecting to another person really helps me feel better. Thanks."
I don't know if I can do it anymore,"I left the military a couple years ago after no longer being able to with cope PTSD and back to back deployments. I'd started school and my wife began a new career and life seemed ok. Almost out of nowhere my sister's kids get taken away by child services and my family begs my wife and I to take custody of the three young children (all under 3) so that my sister may be able to have visitation ( as opposed to what a foster parent might allow). There's tons of fear and trepidation surrounding the notion but we agree to it.
After a couple months of almost no sleep and grades slipping I vent to family members who call me selfish for complaining and not considering the situation the babies and my sister are in. Decide to press on  and sister visits her kids daily but she grows increasingly passive aggressive and treats us like servants and throws fits if we don't raise her kids the way she prefers. Many arguments ensue and we attempt to reconcile and come to a happy solution but sister is never happy and always starts a fight.
Fast forward a couple years and kids are still here with no idea when sister will regain custody. I've graduated school but cant fight a decent paying job due to hours ( cant find/afford anyone to watch the kids during after preschool hours). Now we're behind on bills and sister is being taken to court for child support (not by my request) by the state and she grows madder and more abusive to me by the moment. She's always shown clear signs of antisocial personality disorder and/or narcissism. She's threatening to blame me for fraud (idk how) and accuses me of hurting her kids every time they end up with bruises from fighting one another. She has zero grounds for it or little proof but I know the allegation alone could ruin me. I've been suicidal on and off but I'm really at my wits end. The only solution of getting her off my back is to give custody to child services/foster care but the breaks my heart tremendously to give up the kids, regardless of how hard it's been, since I've had them since infancy. It's making me tear up as I type this. I wanna live but I cant see life getting any brighter. Broke, homeless or in jail are not how I intended for things to be by helping out my family.
TL;DR: have sisters kids but she's not happy and it's ruining my life"
Well I'm at this low place again,"So I guess I have ""passed"" the I'm going to hurt myself although yesterday I did try. It wasn't my first but hopefully my last. I have never been one to talk to people I tried therapy but since holding a job is almost impossible for the last 3 years it's not an option financially. I'm 31 back home with my wife and kid this time and my parents don't think that there is something wrong. I'm pretty open to them they have seen the scars, witnessed an attempt and heard the horrer stories of the closest (I still don't understand how I'm alive) but continue to tell me it's for attention as soon as it happened. I never thought I would be back at this point since I had a kid it was always enough. Now I feel worried that I may pass this onto her or my sadness will just give her bad memories of me. I try and do what I can I even had a job but got hospitalized so I couldn't work and still can't not supposed to lift ten pounds  and I everyone seems to think I want to be lazy and not help like it isn't killing me inside. I'll probably delete this someday as I don't feel the need for a throw away this is just my life and this somehow is the only place I feel comfortable sharing this story. If it wasn't for my brother probably driving the speed of light and being able to break down barriers mentally and physically  I may not be here but I am and just don't even know where to begin to start to feel normal or just happy again I walk through this fog feeling sluggish and useless and just don't want to feel this way if not for me for my daughter. Suggestions on a book a movie maybe someone has something i haven't tried I can't really exercise so that's out at least for the next few months."
I just want somebody to try to help me,"I know there are other people who have it worse and I probably shouldn't be complaining, but this is the lowest I've ever felt. My girlfriend of 4 years just broke up with me, which wouldn't be so bad in itself, if she wasn't also the only person I talked to aside from my parents. Unfortunately, they're not the best or even good at emotional support.
We both just moved to a new town to go to the same new college (not the same apartment) and after a little over a week broke up with me out of nowhere. This had been my longest relationship ever and we were even going back and forth with all the lovey 'love you more' stuff a couple days before. I was completely blindsided. The only thing that's worse is that she is the only person I would ever talk to about something like this. She was the best thing I had in my life, and now I have nothing. She was the thing that kept me from thinking too dark, now all I have is the fact that a life of suffering is better than an eternal void of nothing. I was told we could still be friends and to text her if I needed anything, and after a few days it turned into no responses, and then a few responses basically saying we couldn't be friends for a while and I shouldn't talk to her until we're both completely over it.
I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, or how anybody can help.  The last time I called the suicide hotline, the guy was shit and just kept telling me that therapy is the solution I need, even after I tried that and it didn't work.  Right now I just want somebody to understand how I feel because I don't have anybody left who will honestly care."
A step forward,"I went out and bought some rope today. Don't know when I'll finally take the plunge and do it. This is ok, I'm ok. I'm at peace with it all. It's not the way I wanted to go but I have no other choice in how I go. I just want to let people know that it doesn't get better for everyone.This life isn't for everyone and that's ok. "
Why didn't I jump on Wendsday?,"My dad expects nothing except perfection from me. My mom treats me and my siblings as slaves. One of my best friends can't remember who I am. I'm 12 and nearly jumped off a wall last Wendsday. I don't know how long it will be before I do jump. Oh, and I just found out I'm bipolar on top of my autism."
What Shit do i even have left anymore,"I get Horrible grades no matter how long i study or try. All of my friends only like me because im the class clown and joke around in class and i cant stop doing it because of my adhd, ocd, anxiety and probably one or 2 others that havn't been diagnosed. I have no future as i cant even do fractions and decimals let alone something that a job might require, my only skills are im really good at computers which gets me popularity but that won't mean shit once I try to get a job and everyone made their own os and rom for their custom made phone. What shit do i even have left at this point to care about, none of my teachers wanna help me because i've pissed them off so much that none of them like me, my friends will leave the moment they think my jokes aren't funny anymore and im severly depressed because of all that + the extreme stress of possibly getting kicked out of school as i've been in 2 fights and got 2 suspensions and a third means expulsion and no college will want me once they see that and my grades. I cant do this shit anymore"
No point.,"My best friend has finally grown tired of me. My other friend rarely speaks to me. Im alone.
May as well push my date to tonight.
So. Yeah."
I'm tired me want to stop,I have a girlfriend of 16 years we have a 16-17 year old daughters together. I have a wife of 14 years and we have two 14 a 10 and a 9 year old together. I support both families and give them all the love and care I can but it's getting heavy on me. My girlfriend don't want serious and I ended up married she wanted serious several years later so I gave it my all because I love her no my family. They are polar opposite one skinny one fat everything about them is opposite maybe that's the drain on me. My kids know each other but don't know there related my girlfriend knows my wife does not. I'm tired and want everything to end and I'm betting my life on  day this week to have everyone together and let it all come out I don't know how anybody is going to take it I don't know how I'm going to take it but if it goes the way I expect I think I will end it that night. I feel selfish for feeling this way but I feel it needs to come out for me to stress free and happy what is happiness anyway who decides? This may not make sense but I'm at the bar and drunk again and thinking maybe they should just meet at my funeral then I won't have to deal with any of it ever  If I do that what happens to my kids ? My girlfriend? My wife ? Will they pull through me succeed or will I kill them when I end it ?
I can't believe it's come to this,"I quit my job back in April without a 2 week notice because I was being treated unfairly.  I was livid and I made a huge scene on my last day.  It was stupid because I had worked there for 4 years and now I can't even list that as experience.  I can't even seem to get another job period.  It's been 5 months.  Not to mention it's impossible when I don't have transportation.
The only reason I'm not homeless is my parents haven't kicked me out yet.  I can't stand living here with them though.
I'm going to have to cancel my phone service soon which will mean I can never get a job.
I have no fucking life experience despite being 23 years old.  I don't know how to drive. I can't go out of the house on my own.  I was raised and I continue to deal with narcissistic helicopter parents that have surely contributed to my fear of everything and extreme social anxiety.
The real cherry on top is being so fucking ugly. I have a disorder that has caused substantial permanent hair loss and acne all over.  This past 5 months have been so hard for me,  that I have developed wrinkles (not even fine lines)  around my mouth. I looked in the mirror and I didn't recognize myself. I look like a a balding underdeveloped teenager but with wrinkles and bags under my eyes.
I think this just solidified my decision to end it all.  I've been wanting to for a long time,  and I know I just need to make it happen. No one can say it gets better at this point. That's just a fact.  "
I've been thinking,"So most people have something they strive to fullfil in life. Some of us want to become doctors, some writers, some parents. And those around them want to see them succeed and support them with whatever they can do.I share some of those wishes too. But the one thing that I really want to happen above all else will never be supported by those around me. I want to die; I've wanted to die for more than half my life.Life is full of beautiful things and the world is incredibly beautiful. When you are moved by an emotional movie, when you help a friend surpass a long-term challenge, when you ace your courses after a semester of hard work. These things make you feel like the world is right.But then there's the other side of the coin: the things that make you not content with what the world is. When somebody you admired dies. When your lover breaks up with you. When, after much hard work and devotion, you are still unable to pass half your credits, and drop out of school.All of these are terrible events... But, in a way, they are beneficial to you. Much like how getting together with that special person gave you so much pleasure, breaking up with them fills you with sadness. It reminds you that you're living. It's what allows that pleasure to exist in the first place.No, the really crippling side of life is not those rare but catastrophic events.It's your everyday.When you wake up, and your only notifications are about how you've neglected to submit your financial aid documents for the third day in a row.When you send a friend a text, and they don't answer.When you hear that people are secretly talking about you behind your back.When you try cooking an omelette for breakfast and fail.When you go through an entire day of school without talking to a single person.When you go to work and spend four, six, right hours fantasizing about how you'd want to be anywhere else.When you pick up your pencil to draw, and the only thing that comes out of your hand is gibberish.When you sit down to do your homework and spend an hour on a single quick assignment.When you don't even have enough energy to sit down and play a videogame: your fingers won't move.When you go to bed and you won't fall asleep.When you go three hours over your bedtime, take a sleeping pill, go another three hours without sleep, spend two hours on the computer because it's too late to sleep, have your breakfast and go to school because it's too dangerous to skip, fall asleep during class and be mocked and scolded, go back home where you won't fall asleep, somehow manage to fall asleep at a reasonable hour later in the day after not doing any work, then wake up an hour after your first morning class starts.That kind of life that slowly eliminates your will to live completely. Why is it in my best interest to go with it?Is it gonna get better? For sure. Hell, my life is so much better now than it used to be. But I still don't feel like I wanna live. Maybe I'll never do. Maybe the bad things about life are so much more powerful to me than the good things, it's just not worth it for me to go on.And yet this completely rational desire is written off as the irrational will of somebody too preoccupied with the minute to realize the actual, objective value of the good life that he should be living.Nobody will support me, not after I've described to them how much I really don't want to be here. And that's understandable. Nobody wants to see their friend, boyfriend, son, team member disappear from the face of the Earth.But I think I have the right to decide on my own desires too.It's not a whim, people. It's life slowly scratching off any will I'd possibly have to continue living.People will look at me from the outside and think: What is this guy going on about? He has everything! He's going to a good school, he has loving parents that care for him, he has food on his plate everyday for God's sake.And all of that is true. And I wish I wouldn't take all of these things for granted and they gave me the will I need to keep going. But I can't.So, I don't want to keep going. This is my wish. It's not unfounded, it's not irrational. Why will nobody respect it?Dunno if I'll come back to check any replies, just needed to rant for a bit. Sorry about my English as it's my second language."
If you know things arent going to get better....,"Are there any resources for having a nice, non judgemental suicide with strangers?  I KNOW LIFE IS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER. IT WONT AND EVERY EFFORT HASNT WORKED. Possibly wrong sub but Id like to at least not be alone when I off myself."
"No, I don't want to go on","Firstly, I want to apologize for my English skill there. And every thought.I'm afraid it will be a 'shitpost'. But now.. Now my head is a mess too.  Everything get the worst it could. It is the end of the day. I was online I think the whole day checking my ex's account. Waiting for a miracle maybe. Recently she showed the signs she misses me very much. Added my music. Now deleted. I saw her in school yesterday. Eye contact first time in 3 months.. It was an abusive and horrible relationship for me but after a month of nocontact I still can't move on. All my online actions are connected with her. I'm going insane. It's very obsessive. And.. and I just remembered everything. Everything that happened in the last 5 months. I think I have two large posts about it there but.. it doesn't really matter now. I just feel it. I should go. No regrets already. This state of mind. Messy.What are the problems?.. Ok, so, I'm 17 year old transgender female on DIY hrt in a homophobic and dangerous country, environment. I tried. I fought. I remember my suicidal thoughts from the age of 10 or younger. Alcoholic abusive father (now I'm 20 days living with mom in another flat again) was in my whole childhood. My grandmother is kind of crazy, hates my father believes in everything she had read or saw. It's really insane. All my childhood I was scared of all these supernatural things she told me. It was about my father too (he's probably bipolar). Incredible stress and hopelessness. My brother has bipolar disorder too (officially). He attempted suicide 2 years ago. I have just found out that. My mother isn't that scary but she's very.. I don't know how to name it. But I can tell. If I couldn't do my homework because of totally messed mind, crying near her.. One day she stabbed me with a pencil in an arm because of it. If I don't do something she wants about the education, she makes hell for me. Total restriction, physical beating with everything she has in her hands. It was ok but now the school year started.. And it begins again. I can't take this pressure. She says how bad and lazy I am, doing nothing. But I just can't. I don't have any energy. I'm drained. I'm fighting in the night with the thoughts. It's unbearable. Also now my teacher hates me and threaten me because of my hair. I have to cut it off completely. Just shave. This thing.. that makes me a bit happy. Yeah, I know, these problems may seem very easy and not worthing any attention. But it hits me with its full strength. Pressure from all the sides. Socialization, school, relationships, family.That's all. I'm so messed up. I don't know what to believe, what to do to relieve this emotional pain. I'm too anxious just to go outside. I begin sweating and trembling there.The school demands incredible effort in training for exams. Every teacher hates me, wants me to do my best. I had a psychologist watching me last year. My mom says what an useless shit I am everyday. I have a lot of deadlines and again, everybody hate me. I just can't have this look because boys are not allowed to wear long hair there. The individuality drives this teacher crazy. And the laws are on their side I guess. And I can't do anything about it. I just want to stop, just to stop. it. I want a relief. I don't want to die.But: now I cut literally every day. Wrists, thighs. It helps me a bit. And.. just to think one minute about it. Why to hold on. For what. I know, I will disappoint my mother. She will be.. I don't want to think about it. it makes me feel worse. But.. tomorrow I'll be alone at home after school for 8 hours. Maybe it's the time.. to go. I want to try more in this life though. Oh. I haven't done anything I wanted recently. I want to leave some track, mark about me. I want everybody in the school to know about my.. disappearance. My ex will know too.. I don't know what pushes me the most. But I guess I'll start planning soon. I can't take it anymore. Thanks or reading this.. trash maybe. I'm in a very low state again.."
I just can't.,I know no one is going to really respond. I don't know why I am even bothering. No one cares. I don't expect them to. I'm hopeless. Toxic. Destructive. I ruin everything and I'm the last thing to destroy. There's just no point anymore. There's nothing left but the ashes of what could've been.
Ignored when I reach out,"About a week ago, when I was really desperate, I posted about my mental health problems on social media. I didn't get many responses--a couple of ""hang in theres"", ""good vibes"" sort of stuff. One person who responded was a former classmate. She asked if she could help and I told her I could use someone to talk to. She said I could reach out to her any time. It was late that night, so I sent her a message in the morning. The conversation was brief. I felt worse afterward. I really needed to talk to someone and she offered. I thought she would actually listen and be there. I tried reaching out to her again last night, giving her an update on the things we talked about last week. It's been a whole day and she never opened the message, but she's been on social media multiple times since. I found out yesterday that she was actually in the same city. It hurt a lot to learn she was here and didn't reach out since she's aware of how isolated I am and that I'm going through a hard time. It's really painful to have been given hope that this person cares/wants to help me and then have her actively avoid me. I don't know what I did wrong--I don't think I put too much of my problems on her in that initial conversation. It would help me a lot to have her to talk to, but she seems over it/not interested. I don't know how to fix or if I should try again with her. "
wondering,"wondering how you are doing , just ran into your post. I own pets and lost a couple.  hope you are doing well."
Can You Guys Please Tell Me Why Is It You Feel Like Dying Is The Only Solution,"I know this might seem like a very unpersonal question, but I am really interested in knowing the events that have led and why do other people feel like they can't just go through the next day. I am not suicidal right now, but I often find myself thinking that I should have taken more pills or should have let the blood go and cut longer. But if anyone's interested please share. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FOLLOWING LONG ASS TEXT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, JUST WRITE DOWN YOUR STORY. Anyways, here's me:I am 16, male. Well if you really wanna start from the beginning, I was sexually abused from 2006 (the year my parents got divorced) to early 2010 and just when I started to understand what was going on, my grandma died so I couldn't really tell my mom because grief hit her really hard. During this time I changed schools because I had no friends and kids were really mean (I used to play Barbies with my cousin) and I started classes at this new school. As a 10 year old I loved Child's Play, Fright Night, Dracula and Van Helsing a lot so I sometimes played like I was a vampire at school, and so rumors started going around that I was satanic and that I drank blood from used tampons and band aids. Then in 2012 (I was 11) I was raped again by another man and I didn't tell anyone because I feared they'd call me a faggot again (sorry if it sounds homophobic, but thats how it happend). I started screaming at night, taking long ass showers and fantasizing about death. I started cutting my stomach. It got better for a while, I had friends, I was getting along with my family but then on February 2013 in a class trip (on Galapagos islands for two weeks) my ex classmates were staying at our same hotel. They told everyone about me as a kid and as you might expect no one talked to me for the rest of the trip. My friends kinda felt ashamed of being around me and when we got back home bullying started with jokes about my past, my weight, and a video I uploaded on Youtube about me and the ""Pear Phones"". I hid my rape story for people not to call me a fag again but they did anyways so I tried to kill myself for the first time using growth syrup. Lots of it. I just got diarreha so no biggy. After that it actually started going well. I actually was popular for a while and then my friends started making me aside and as a 14 year old the movie Thirteen kinda triggered me and I started cutting again (really superficial). Then on September 2015 my voice started to change, and I freaked out and I took the dumbest decision of my life. I decided to fake it so the change of my voice wouldn't be felt. Two weeks into class and I wanted to go back to my regular voice, but surprise surprise, my real voice was actually a lot deeper than the one I was using. So long story short I continued faking it until July 2017. On 2016 my fake voice was starting to break every five seconds and I was speaking lower and lower, so naturally people started noticing. Every oral presentation every reading out loud in class, people laughed at me. On summer vacations I told myself I had to stop faking my voice because it would fuck up everything, but as I faked it with my family I kinda found it imposible to stop. So I continued and the first week of class September 2016 we did a lot of reading as a class and that exact week I was kinda sick, so it sounded horrible. The following months the bullying was really intense. Everytime my name was mentioned or I opened my mouth people would laugh scream at me names, say that I was throat fucked up a hammer, etc. I was scared of hanging out with my friends because if I did, they would mention my voice immediately. So I was alone for a long time, but I still had hope. New Year's Eve I was walking with my pug (my literal shoulder to cry on) and asking if I would make it through this year. I was going to therapy since November because the school told my mom I was seen ""alone and sad"". I just needed a friend. I really needed one, so I thought that if I acted cool with this guy and didn't tell him the shit I did I would have one friend. Bad call. Then my mom told me we were moving to Chile on March (it was Feb 08 I think the day she told me) and I fell into a deep deep depression. I cried a lot because I didn't wanna leave my family and I still hoped I could make it work with my friends. Then my birthday came and it started going well, and me and an old friend (who kinda teased me a lot and didnt really like me but felt bad for me anyways) invited about 22 people to eat on the Friday of my birthday week. Three people showed up and they all went to hang out without me after so then I realised I had no actual friends anymore. On March 2nd one of my best ""friends"" turned 16 and I checked his page and I just checked mine again (my bd is on Feb 19) and felt really bad with myself and I just took every pills I found at home (about 16) and I took them, hoping it would kill me. It didn't. Then my mom and I settled that she'd go by herself to Chile on March 20th and I'd join her when I finished this year. So she left and I went to live with my dad and grandparents who started saying that they knew I was faking my voice and I had to speak like a man, which made me feel shitty. I also stopped going to therapy because it was to far away from my grandparents house. I started cutting again (very superficially) but I had my dog to keep me sane and unrequited love to keep me looking foward. My dog started walking a little bit weird but I thought it was just from playing with my grandparents dog and then on a Saturday his legs were not working. I rushed him to the vet thinking it was a broken leg and the doctor said he had multiple tumors on his back and coxis. I was still optimistic even though everyone said the treatment would be too expensive and hurt ful for him. I stayed from 10 PM to 3 AM cleaning his legs and body from his shit and pee and trying to make him walk. On Sunday we had agreed to discuss what we were going to do with him, so we got there on Sunday (me and my older brother) morning. They put him to sleep. I couldn't take it. My pride was just too damn big that I couldn't let my brother or the doctors see me cry so I kissed my pug the hardest I had ever kissed anyone and I left him there just when they started injecting him. I hated myself so much for leaving him alone when he needed me the most. He was there everytime I was bullied so hard at school that I didn't want to wake up the next day, and he only needed me for a few minutes and I couldn't even give him that. I sneaked in home, I got the 30 Buprex 400mg pills I bought and I started writting a note, I stopped however when I heard my dad and brother shouting if they had seen me anywhere. And I knew how shitty they'd feel if I did it so I didn't do it.The bullying started to become unberable. I however understood that the people were not the ones to blame. If every single classmate, every teacher, every store clerk, every old lady, every old friend, if everyone joked/talked/laughed over my voice it wasn't their fault but mine. So everytime it happend I would go home look at myself in the mirror and cry. I had everything planned out to kill myself. The notes. The pictures. Videos of myself telling my family that I loved them and that they should not blame themselves at all. It was June so the presure of finals and going to a new country and starting a new life really scared me. I was really scared that I would fuck it up again. The last day of school the counselor told everyone I was moving to Chile and they were all surprisingly upset. We had known each other since we were kids so I guess I could see why. Two days before my departure my whole family hired this party bus to say say goodbye. It was really loud so I couldn't speak at all. I came home and I was feeling really angry and sad at myself for not enjoying the farewell gift they hsd given me. That night I decided to try to kill myself slitting my wrists. I bought this brand new razors (I had been cutting almost daily and really deep for a while by then with this old blade) and I pressed as hard as usual, this razor was really sharp however and I bled a lot. I decided to make the bleeding stop pressing it with toilet paper. The next day my ex friend (who didnt really like me but pittied me and helped me plan my birthday) had been my best friend for about 4 years in a row and he threw me a farewell party. Out of the like 60 guests only 30 showed up, but I had a great time (because weed and alcohol baby). My cut of the night before got accidentaly open again and I started bleeding like crazy. My whole sleeve was black from the blood and there was blood everywhere on the ground. So I spend pretty much my whole party on the bathroom. The next day (the day before my departure I had to make my bags, and I was couldn't stop crying. It was about 10 PM and my bag wasn't done. My mom who came back from Chile started screaming at me. I just decided to say fuck it. I followed my mom into the living room. I said goodbye to my brother to my mom (and hugged her) and told them I loved them. I went into my room. Locked the door. Put all my stuff in a corner. Left the note in the bed. Opened the shower, ripped my crost and slit my other wrist. It was 11 PM I think and I woke up around 2:13 AM surrounded by blood with my neck and head hurting, feeling kinda sick and with my arms hurting. I don't know if it was that I wasnt thinking straight but I cleaned up the blood and made my bags. "
What do you do when you have no will to live?,"I haven't wanted to live for a long time. I don't know if I ever consciously chose life. I'm alive because I have to be--I take care of my mom who has a lot of health problems. I have no dreams or desires because I know from experience that I'll never achieve or obtain anything good. I don't want to live, but I have to. I don't want to feel the way I do anymore, but this feeling never goes away. I don't know how to make myself fight for life when I don't want it. I don't know how to improve things when I have no desire for anything. I've even let go of wanting to feel better because I never do. "
"Feeling hopeless about the future and in a situation I want to change, but have no option because of my job.","Over the past three days, I have gone from flying high with happiness to sitting on my bathroom floor for hours with a knife in hand trying to come up with reasons not to end it there and then. Each day began with an overwhelming sense of worthlessness and loneliness that stems from years by myself. Since freshman year of college, I have lacked a true best friend and have repeatedly failed to make the jump from friends to being in a relationship. Most recently, those attempts have been complicated by having a close friend chosen over me. These have strained my friendships from a personal perspective though until recently I did my best to hide my feelings of jealousy and depression. This most recent incident led to a full mental breakdown as my closest friend and confidant was the culprit. The only person who I have been able to talk to in recent memory and here I sit wanting to hate his guts, yet rely on him to prevent me from doing something truly stupid. In addition to having one close confidant I have self-medicated heavily with alcohol for years and marijuana for months to simply allow me to sleep at night. Neither being solutions, my sincere desire to be loved and wanted has grown into an immense and impassable wall that will not let me go on.When graduating college, I was able to keep my spirits up by telling myself in graduate school it would be different, that I would find someone who cared. It is now the start of my fifth year of graduate school, and despite having more friends at one time than ever before, I feel more alone than ever before. I come home from work and never have a real conversation until two weeks ago. A new student began texting me on a regular basis and we seemed to be pretty compatible. She enjoyed activities that I enjoyed and we seemed to be getting along well. My close friend returns from a conference and she goes back to swooning over him, despite that he was seeing another girl. Nonetheless, they grow close and she virtually stops talking to me dropping the proverbial floor out from under me. Finally, on Thursday night it hits me. In the middle of a pick-up volleyball game with her, I realize that I do not want to be there or anywhere. I suddenly have an overwhelming desire to cry and cannot think straight. So naturally, I leave immediately, walk home alone as usual, and have a breakdown for about an hour. When I cannot take it anymore I go over and smoke with a few friends, but toward the end of the session I begin to feel the anxiety and loneliness creeping in and immediately leave. Barely sleeping, I go to work Friday morning and take care of what I need to do and leave by noon as I cannot talk to either my confidant or the girl. I proceed to go home and cry and lay down attempting to let the feelings pass, but dwelling on the simple fact that I must be outright undesirable. After all, it�۪s been eight years, in the words of George Constanza, ���I�۪m the king of it�۪s not you, it�۪s me!�۝ Most of Friday afternoon, I begin to feel that suicide is the only option to truly make things better. Dwelling on all of the failed infatuations I have had over the years and the numerous times that I watch my crush fall into a relationship with someone else. By early evening I stabilize, smoke and decide to go to our mutual friend�۪s pregame and club night. High as a kite, I am content with the world and able to deal with everything well surrounded by friends. We arrive at the club, and I am already uncomfortable with being forced to dance as I have really bad social anxiety, but I am trying to deal with it as everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves. I start to come down and realize that I can no longer be there and decide to leave, my confidant stops me on the way out making me promise to not kill myself and to meet him for lunch tomorrow. Little does he know that he is part of the reason I feel this way. Saturday hits, I barely slept, and go to my car service appointment feeling decently well. Then I go to work and see my confidant, and lose it. I immediately drop back into the jealousy and hatred. I go home and sit on my bathroom floor with a knife in hand for about an hour. I test the blade against my skin and really just wondering if it will truly be better or whether I have a chance to turn my life around. Maybe I can attempt it and it will act as a call for help. My confidant asks how it is going over text, and I respond that today is worse than yesterday as it was. He urges me to get help, but coming from the person that I feel most betrayed by makes me even angrier. I order shitty chinese food, which normally I would devour, but eat less than a quarter of it. I am disgusted with myself for ordering it in the first place. I move between video games, attempting to sleep, and watching TV for hours. Finally decide to go to work, finish prepping for my trip that starts the next day. Spend about three hours attempting to stabilize hoping that my confidant comes over to talk, but at the same time even seeing him makes my blood boil. I walk home and see my bike had been stolen from my apartment building. I am completely apathetic toward the feeling of being violated by some random stranger. I sink into a chair and sit there staring out the window for what felt like an eternity, texting my confidant and my crush. Both stop texting me around the same time, I get high and go to sleep.Getting up well before the crack of dawn getting less than five hours of sleep for a fourth night in a row. I feel like garbage and go through episodes of anger and sadness. I wonder if I should just kill myself and avoid the next week of seclusion and loneliness on the trip I have to a laboratory. I drive to my Dad�۪s house and here I sit wondering whether I will make it through the week. I took a nap and realized I need to take the toxic relationships out of my life including - my crush, my confidant, a previous crush and another close friend, and then one friend who is just an asshole. On top of these changes, I need to stop self medicating and go get real help. I keep having to stop myself from relapsing back into the thoughts of hate, but also how rid myself of even these toxic relationships will only remove roughly half of my close friends further complicating the problem. I am really scared that being alone with my thoughts for the next 8 days is a dangerous situation. I have no way out without risking my career, but I am risking my life. I really do not know what to do because there is no way to get out of this commitment. At the same, time I no longer have any hope that I will find someone in graduate school, and then I will move onto a post doc where I am in another temporary position where I will not know anyone to start. I don�۪t want to be alone forever, and I feel that ending my suffering now is still the best option. I�۪m scared. My career is stressful, but I am at the top of my class and can go anywhere I want, but the fact that I have to do it all alone terrifies me further compounding the feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness. Having a week alone to dwell does not bode well and at this point I really don�۪t know what to do, but keep coming back to suicide."
Each breakdown leads me closer to the end,"Basic background: I've been suicidal since I was 8. I've attempted suicide upwards of 9 times. I have severe depression, anxiety, and anorexia. I've been hospitalized upwards of 5 times for suicide attempts.  I've been good for about a year with keeping my suicidal stuff in check. I'm a high school senior who moved in with my aunt and uncle. I refuse to kill myself while I live with them. It's just not an option for me morally since it's not my home and it would be rude to have them have to deal with it. However, I'm going off to college soon, and that mentality will not keep once I get my own place.I'm just postponing the inevitable but it gets harder day by day. I'm at the point to where I'll wake up, go to school, spend time online, do work and go to bed. It's routine, it's unfulfilling and there's nothing I can do about it. My therapist is sincerely worried that I have no 'fun things in life' and it's laughable to me because it's so usual for me to just not do anything other than schoolwork and numbing myself with the internet.But yeah. I'm probably going to be dead within the next couple years. It's weird to think that I'll most likely never be 20.I don't know if I'm looking for help or just a place to actually say what has been running through my mind ever since I was 8. "
I'm trans but I can't transition. I don't see a reason to living anymore.,I want to die. I'm a trans person with dysphoria and I don't know how to handle it. I'm probably going to kill myself Thursday.
I'm really sorry,"Last night was the first time crying for a really long time. I haven't cried since I was a kid. It's like I almost forgot how to cry and became a stronger person but in reality I'm still weak and was just bottling up my emotions. I cried so much because a person I care so much about got angry at me. Might be a stupid reason to a lot of you but to me it means a lot and I take things too seriously. I've never had someone get angry at me like this before. I'm an INFJ and so I care more about other people more than myself. I'm selfless. I like helping people and making them happy. I would risk my life to save another with no hesitations. I rarely have any conflicts with people because I'm always friendly, kind, understanding and non judgmental. So when she got angry at me it hurt. I felt it so much. I had a panic attack. I could not breathe and my heart was racing like it wants to rip out of my chest. Tears just started falling down out of nowhere. She's was in the right to be angry. I made a terrible mistake. I said stupid things. Everything is my fault. I wished I've never did what I did on that night with you. I hate myself for overthinking everything and should of just acted like a normal person. Even though we've only known each other for a short while I really cared a lot about you. I have trust issues and getting attached to people so quickly. 2017 has been worst year of my life. Starting from beginning of the year where I had an infection and was in so much pain and had to get surgery. Then getting a job and hated it and quit. Then struggling to find a new job. Then getting really bad anxiety and being depressed with no motivation, no appetite, no sleep. Then getting tinnitus on my ear. And then my uncle getting really sick and old and depressed and is in hospital. I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I feel like it never ends. Things keep getting worse and worse. I'm in the darkness slowly swallowing me into the abyss. I hate my life. I hate myself. "
"Been postponing suicide because of mum and dad, but should I really?","I've been contemplating suicide since the age of 20, and am 25 in November this year. You can look into my posting history for more info on my situation. Life has improved for me, but I'm not sure I want to stay in this world anyway.Up to recently, the strongest force that was holding me back from committing suicide was the idea that if I die before mum and dad, they'd have to bury me, and man, I'd hate making them go through this... As time went by, however, I became getting number to this concern. Oh, I'll be causing them pain? NO, they caused me lots of pain by bringing me into this world! Oh, they care about me? Well, they don't seem to want to put any effort to keep me alive, why should I put that effort for THEIR pleasure?Same goes to the method of suicide I consider, which is jumping in front of the train. Oh, will it be an inconvenience, perhaps even a traumatic experience to the engineer and the passengers? If they are against assisted suicide, they deserve that inconvenience! If they are for it, my death will be a precedent they can use to advocate for assisted suicide, so I'll help there.So, really. What's there left to stop me?"
I purposely put myself in this state of mind,And now I can't get out
Not Doing So Hot,"I'm not even sure where to begin. I'm 24, graduated undergrad in May with a double major and am currently working on a paralegal certification.I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for around ten years at this point. Over the past year or two especially I've been losing the fight to agoraphobic tendencies. I can't imagine finding or holding down a job. I feel panicky just meeting up with somebody or running errands.I used to have so many close friends. People drift but.. it's been months since anyone reached out. I've exhausted myself trying to make friendships and relationships work with other people.I flipped out on my ex today. We stopped talking for a while. Recently started talking again and found out she's dating already after a variety of ""I can't be with anyone"" bullshit when we broke up. Told her I can't deal with being shoved off to the side for other people. I can't handle having such strong feelings for somebody anymore. I've never known that something so beautiful (love) could be so destructive.I can't imagine my future. I've always sort of had it in my head that one day I'll just off myself. I feel like that day is rapidly approaching much faster than I thought it would.I feel as though I'm losing/have lost everything. My dad's dying from cancer, all of my closest friends have made their own lives in new places. I tried reaching out to a ton of people tonight and couldn't get a single response.I don't really know what the point of this is.. I'm terrified of death, and of hurting my family, but I'm scared that if things continue the way they have been, those fears won't matter so much anymore.It's been a gentle downward slope for the last two years; the past 6 months in general have just been one thing after another.I don't know what to do. I'm the ""smart and funny"" guy. Or I was when I was more social. I can't keep up hiding behind a happy face. I just drove aimlessly for an hour today crying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I could be such a successful and happy person if I could just fix my mental illness issues.I'm laying in bed right now having a panic attack wishing I could rip myself out of my own skin. Just float around detached from everyone and everything; observing but not participating or feeling.Thanks for reading..Edit: just wanted to add that I've been seeing a psychiatrist for several years now and I'm working on getting back into therapy"
Im 16 my whole life was a misery,"I just want to die because Im poor,ugly,I am not love  by anyone and oont love anyone other than my brother who is in the United States never seen him since I was a kid,I love video games but dont have a fucking console and my younger nephew who is 11 and have his own ps4 and I have nothing that I want and Im here in my room all alone and I literrally just beaten myself up and bit myself on the arm school starts tommorow I hate it ever since I was 9 I was always insecure about my looks and always comparing myself to my classmates and I will feel like shit.....I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE AND I HAVE A DISEASE"
I shouldn't have been born,"I'm really sorry for posting here and potentially ruining someone else's day. But I feel like I need someone else to make sense to me as I lost the ability to.  I don't even know what to write at this point. I have a growing hatred for myself, and every day I turn into a less and less functional adult. I hate myself for not being able to do things that everyone else can do. That everything takes so much anxiety from me, and I'm just being a bother to everyone. Even counselling didn't help, even though I'm really trying so hard. And they are giving up on me too, they taught me everything they knew, so I guess after that if it didn't improve it might as well be a lost cause. I can't even tell them, because I dont want to offend them, or escalate things, as I'm terrified for that too.   Even though I'm an adult I cut myself open whenever the opportunity arises. I even went cold turkey on lexapro/wellbutrin just to hurt myself more. I feel like the next step is to just end it or ef myself up even more by ODing on it. But I don't know if that's even an effective way to go. Probably not, but it's an easy step. Would have been so much easier if I haven't been born in the first place, so I wouldn't have to hurt my family even more. I'm just sorry for existing and growing into what I am today. "
I know,I know it's an imbalance of chemicals telling me this is the worst. Because really I know it's not the worst.The worst is way behind me.I know.But still here I am.Wondering why I've meant nothing to the people in my life.Nothing but a prop.A whipping postI know.It's not my fault.I know I deserve better.I know.I knowI know.And it never happens. I talk. I givw. I work. I ponder. I'm curious. I think of creative ways to solve my boring ordinary problemsI know there's worse out there.I know.But do I have to? Do I have to keep doing this?I know I'd never see my best friends daughter grow up. But there's so much pain. I can't bare to watch the innocence drain from another little girl. Replaced with pain and hardship and despair.I know I'd miss out on the food I have tried.That I'll never finish a painting.I'll never see the Oakland raiders win another Superbowl.I'll never see Fiji or Chile or France or Spain. I know.But is it worth it? It doesn't feel worth it if I have to keep come back here.Please don't make me.
So tired of being depressed,"A few times a week I get so tired of being depressed that I just want to kill myself. This is one of those moments. I hate seeing people happy, especially couples. All of my relationships have ended terribly, with me cowing in fear at my abusive Ex after I finally couldn't take any more and broke up with them.I know I'm not supposed to derive my happiness from another person but I feel so lost. I was miserable with my Ex and I'm miserable without her. I hate her actually. I've been miserable this entire year. I'm still relatively young but I'm wasting whatever youth I have left. I have a few friends, but I feel like I will just bring them down if I spend time with them. I want to go out and do more social things but I feel crippled by anxiety. I can't afford a therapist. I live in a foreign country, and if I returned to the USA I'd have to live with my parents.This feeling will pass and come back later. I just want to die right now."
Just thoughts i needed to let everybody know,"This concerns anybody who reads this, ik u hear the same stuff from the same people tryna console u if ur suffering with something and thats just in our nature. But please know that right now as of this second there is a person that cares like trust me on this please and i understand that its hard for u because im not close to u or anything but please know that i care to convey this message. There are things that some people here have not experienced that they need to experience, make this a goal that u can put devotion into to help u live a better life but a lot dont know that some of lifes keys are simple and are available to you if u think deep enough. Again this sounds so stupid i know and not a lot of people might understand but if u are able to get ur body to a point of where it is comfortable to unlock ur deepest thoughts u should try, and they might be painful im warning but ik ur smart enough that u at least understand that. Ive been rambling and i dont expect everybody to read this thats completely understandable but anybody who does please take this seriously and try to unlock your deepest thoughts in your mind, i trust you will be strong enought to comprehend them and as a result will even change as a person."
Feeling depressed and suicidal.,"I want to die. I am 26 years old still in college,I am not smart, I don't look good, The girl I love has a boyfriend and I am losing my hair. I don't enjoy life anymore."
Im ready to kill myself.,Ive had enough of the bs thats called life.
"I am finally alone, its time.","My parents are out of town.
This is the opportunity I was waiting for for months.
I have two whole weeks to clean/pack/write letters/and say goodbye. I feel bad that they are going to come home to my death. That as soon as they get off the plane they will realize I am not there to pick them up. I know my mom isnt ever going to recover. I know shes going to need my brothers support. I know he hates me and there wont be any. I never deserved the life I had. I was an engineer, a friend, a son, a brother and I threw everything away time and time again. I'm sorry mom, dad, brother. I love you. Please forgive me. I love you so much."
Something I wrote last night,"I've been trying to get into more writing and I feel like it's more poetry based but I'm proud of this one and just wanted to share it with someone so here it goes.No more trying to hide these feelings in my mind. Laying them all out for you to find. Gonna end up another statistic, in this sadistic world we call home. Take this bullet straight through the dome. This blade I drag across my skin, love the pain it puts me in. When the blood starts to shed. I'm finally out of my head. Try to hide from what I'm feeling. Know the damage I'd be dealing, to family and friends, how many times would they pick up the phone. Only to hear a tone. Dealing with depression, is this recession on your soul. Fighting this battle inside. Push the feelings deeper, only for them to climb steeper. Already tried a few times to end it all. Never been one to stand tall. Can't hold my head up high, knowing I won't be heading for the sky. When it's all said and done. I'm still holding this gun. Pointed straight at my face, not even in a dark place. Bout to take this blast. Happy to be a thing of the past."
Is there a way to call the suicide hotline without them trying to trace you,I am not actively planning but I want to talk so bad.
"wellp, it's been real","went out and bought myself a pint of gin, and i'm about a quarter of the way through itfor ten long years i've hated my pathetic miserable life. years of therapy, diagnoses and the like can't helponly thing i have to look forward to is my psych eval the day after my bday to put me on mood stabilizersi lived the life i wanted for a short while, and to be honest, it's probably the best i'll getit doesn't add up, the live i have and the way i feel. something is in imbalance here. oh well. i can't keep doing this. keep pretending that everything is okay.i'll be writing up a note and a final testament in about an hour or so. basically as soon as this pint is done. take care duders and duderettes. like ya, love ya, papa bless"
Please give me a reason to keep going,I just wanna buy a bottle of Xanax and a fifth of Vodka not even sure if that's enough to OD but it would be a hell of a ride
Everyone hates me,"Every. Single. Fucking. Human. Being.I'm hated by everyone. My classmates (who have verbally told me that they hate me), my ""friends"", and even suicidal people hate me. I'm worthless to everyone and just another fucking doormat to be stepped on.Yeah well you you all.
I'm giving myself 1 year to live and if it gets worse I'm going bye bye."
it sucks :(,"I keep comparing myself to my to ppl i know, such as my bigger brother (36) he has a job, wife & kids. And i'm still stuck at home at the age of 22 because of depression and anxiety, with no degree or job, i feel like a worthless shit.
Never been in a relationship, sometimes i wish i had somebody just to hug, cuddle and talk feelings with, but shit i'm a ugly and an unattractive guy. Don't have any irl friends, the only friends i have is online/steam. The only girl that i've talked with for more than 5mins has a bf, and i'm quite jealous. Jesus i feel like a pathetic loser, id like to end it all someday."
It's funny how tiny things can make an entire life worthless,"My whole life seems OK, for the most part.Normal family, good friends, hobbies that I was pretty good at (math, music, programming and IT), nice opportunities for education. I looked good, had no trouble finding a partner. Etc, etc.But because I'm trans, it's all for nothing. I can't live as a guy, and I won't be a woman. I'm huge, deformed by male puberty, my bones are and will always be bones of a man. There are no women with shoulders this broad, ribcage this huge and hips this narrow. I've been on hormones for a long time and they haven't changed a thing. I just can't describe how much pain seeing my body and my face brings me. At this point, suicide seems like a reasonable option if it makes the pain go away."
I Just Want To Stop Fighting,"I don't think I want to die, but I don't know. Really I'm just very tired and I want to rest instead of keep fighting. I've had mental health issues for twenty one years now and it works in a cycle. For a few months I'm alright, just low grade sadness and anxiety, but I can get through my day and enjoy life. Then it hits and I don't like food, I'm not hungry, and most of my resources go to fighting intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. In the first stage I fight those thoughts by pointing out that I shouldn't hurt myself. In the second stage once the first one fails, I argue against the methods as they are not practical or would not work. In the third I focus on my family and the way it may hurt them. If the third stage ever fails, I will probably be dead. It lasts from days, to weeks usually until I'm out of the pit and back on steady ground.Problem is, I don't want to keep fighting this cycle. I don't want to screw around with medication until I find the right dosage. I don't want people who don't know the extent of this problem to judge me or decide what's best for me either.Example: I discovered two puffs of devil's lettuce wakes some part of myself back up. I stopped crying around 10 or 11, and now at 29 I cry maybe once a year or less. Not for lack of trying, just... I can't cry more than a few tears. I also don't have many urges to protect myself or fight back. But two puffs and suddenly I could sit and cry for a half hour with tears. Suddenly I don't want to be snapped at and abused, so I reflect it back on people who try. Husband was ecstatic because he 'had his wife' finally, instead of brief glimpses of me.But a co-worker? They decided that the smoke caused panic attacks. And no, I didn't smoke at work. Only at home, and I washed well, but they said I was causing an allergic reaction in them. So quit or get a random drug test. Same person who says I can't have Bipolar II because in the two years I've worked there, they've never seen a manic episode in me. Nevermind the month or more I stopped sleeping in Junior High.She and the Boss know what's best so no more smoke, go get more pills and hope for the best.That was Monday. Since then I've taken a lot of my medicine. I had something that helped. I don't want to fight anymore. But it doesn't do much. Trouble breathing, heart feels off, muscles keep spasming or arm twitches. Eyes dilated. It's uncomfortable and even painful, but it's been three days.I just don't want to fight anymore."
I thought things were getting better,"but here I am, wondering if I could kill myself with my baseball bat. Because that's how desperate I've gotten. and Im so alone that instead of talking to someone Im typing this post into reddit.
life is a cruel mistress. Death has become palpable. its like hes sitting across from me. its all I can think about. I just didnt know what else to do. Im so alone"
I've set a date,"I managed to push away everyone that tried to care about me. I had been going through a rough year, with over 8 months of job applications and not a single call. I made some unwise decisions while at school - not 'bad', but unwise - and I'm paying for the choices I made at 14 into my adult life, with no way to fix it.  In June of this year, I lost the one thing that I had been holding on to, and now everyone is trying their hardest to keep it away from me when I'm scratching and clawing to get back the one purpose I had. Everyone is holding it away, knowing that it's all I was living for, like they want me to lose all hope.  I have subpar education, no extraordinary skills, no money, no work history, no hope, and only one way out. I'm an ordinary person living in a world where you need to be spectacular to get by.  I don't want professional help, because that only leads to a life that I don't want to have. There are other people that want and need the help more than I do, and I don't want to take the resources away from them.  This just isn't the world for me. "
I don't want to die..,"I don't want to die, but I really don't want to be here anymore. The past few days have been shit. I talked to my partner about my insecurities, and it's triggered him to practically ignore me the past 3 days. He's mad at  and making out like it's impossible for me to have these insecurities, that it's made up etc. I try so hard to make him happy, to give him all he wants, but I'm just still not good enough. My feelings are still not valid. For the first time ever all I want to do is impose physical pain on myself, because the emotional pain is just overwhelming. I can't stop crying. I can't stop thinking about just packing up my stuff and going. The reason I don't is 1) we have 2 kids and 2) I have nowhere to go. I think maybe I should just leave them behind too, but I just cannot do that. They are the I my reasons keeping me from wanting to die. Without them my life has no meaning so I may as well just die if I'm going to leave them behind. I just don't want to keep on breathing through this pain anymore. I feel so worthless. So invisible. So inconvenient. "
Nothing can fix me. I just want to take my pills and sleep forever.,I'm so tired of failing at everything. My fianc̩ left me. I had to move back home. My family doesn't understand and my mom looked at me like I was crazy when I told her that I think I needed to be admitted. What's the point of fighting the demon anymore when I can tell you exactly how many pills I have in that bottle?
I want to kill myself... but not die?,"This is really weirdSo, I am a 13 year old male, I'll say that now. I didn't come here for attention, nor for a bunch of people to say ""Nooo suicide is bad! Don't do it you've got so much to live for!"" I am in a very confusing situation. I've been depressed for 2 and a half years. My stepdad attacked me, I'm always negative, my mum seemed to hate me and told me she was ""f***king sick of living with me"" always swore and shouted at me constantly. Moved to my dads as a change/ fresh start. I have siblings here I get on better with than at my mums, but I'm still not that close. I've had no friends for years, I contemplate suicide daily. I just stopped cutting but its hard. I dont get pleasure from things anymore. I never have any energy or anything. My dad knows and he wants me to get counselling and anti depressants. (Suicide also runs in my family, my dad attempted, my uncle did twice and my auntie three times, as well as my cousin self harming and being really depressed for years) And so many times I've been that close to doing it. But I don't want to die- I want things to change. But it feels like they never will. I've given up. It's very confusing. I get bullied at school and told to kill myself all the time. I get that high school relationships are pointless and mean nothing, but it would be nice to not be the only one in my form to not have been asked out. Mainly because everyone hates me. Sorry, I'm rambling here, I just don't know what to do."
My progress from last time i posted here.,"Hey, ive posted here before and i just wanted to post my progress, my suicidal thoughts are still here but i wont do it, mostly because i know how much it would fuck up my family. Depression is still here and i still despise my self ( i cant change that), got 1 best friend who i tell everything about my life and she knows everything. I'm trying to endure the pain of being alone, but i'm hoping it will go away eventually but its been 4 years and its still here. Waking up is still hard for me, i have no social life mostly becuase my family is poor which means no party which means i'm not getting invited to a lot of places because people here dont like people without money, 12+ of hours a day i spend on my computer and i die inside everytime my best friend cancels to hangout with me. I will return again in a year to talk about my progress. "
Existence is pain.,"Hi.. My name is Martin, I'm 18 years old and I need to vent out a little bit.. I'm tired. I feel like I've been living for 100 years already. I would describe my problem as ""existential depression"" if something like that exists. It all started, as i remember, an year ago when i realised I'm gay. But my sexuality isn't the root of my problem. I was always kinda intoverted, melancholic and dark minded cos of things that happened in our family and other things.. It just made me think a lot more then ever before. This year was, thanks to this ""lightbulb moment"", mostly about my personal development and trying to ""find myself"". I feel like completely different person now, in a good way. I've set my life goals and similar stuff.. But it wasn't so bright as it seems. I'm tired because i don't want answers anymore. I feel like I've had enough of this world. I'm writing this because I'm not in the best mood rn. But i feel like that almost every damn day. It's like ""nothing and nobody have a purpose"". To be honest, almost everyday I'm trying to find a reasons why not to kill myself.
I'm not gonna kill myself. I know it. It's just my dream. Every morning is not start of a ""new adventure"". It's start of another nightmare and I'm just living for going to bed again, dreaming about disappearing and never having to live that life again. I'm jealous about happiness of other people. They have something i don't have.. Like.. Spark or whatever.
I hate things like alcohol, cigarettes, drugs and similar. I want to keep my body clean. But sometimes i just want to buy few bottles and drink to death. Still, I'm trying to resist. I even started to do sports to distract myself. I was running two times per day to give my day a purpose instead of hurting myself or doing similar stupid stuff. It was my way to exhaust myself physically. I didn't want to cut or anything. This running routine helped but not for long.
So I'm here, stuck in this vicious circle with my nihilistic thoughts and opinions while listening to Elliott Smith and overthinking... I don't know what to do..
Visiting a therapist or someone? Cool, but i don't to take any medications or something. It's disgusting for me.I don't even know what i want.. Writing this out helped me but i still feel empty. I want to cry but i can't. It's like that almost an year already and the hardest thing is to pretend you're ok around others..
And I'm scared that it will never end.
Only thing I'm still here for are people i care about. If they would not be here, i would probably do something stupid.I've tried to keep it as short as possible and there's much more into it and i feel like words are not enough to describe it. Also, I apologize for my english, it's not my native language."
Very concerned about my 11 yr old. He cut himself today and is saying he wants to die.,"Me and my wife have been concerned with possible depression with our 11 yr old son for a little while now. I think he is addicted to video games. He just started middle school and has had a ton of homework that he's not keeping up with. We took away the games this morning until he has his work caught up. Next thing I know my other daughter runs into my room to let me know he grabbed a knife and was trying to make himself bleed out. I run back to his room where he had cut the top of his wrist several times with a butter knife, nothing major looks like a cat scratches him.I need advice. I have no idea what to do. I think it's more for attention but I don't think you can be to careful in a situation like this. Are there any free or cheap services I can use for help? I make to much money to get Medicaid but not enough to afford I.I've already called the suicide hotline to get some advice but I  have seen how amazing Reddit can be for stuff like this and would really appreciate any advice."
Can't stand one more night of feeling like this,"I don't know what to do anymore, I'm just gonna yell into the void here a bit because I don't know what else to do.  I'm so fucking sad and alone. I'm at the point where being awake is too exhausting and depressing.I wake up most mornings feeling so empty that all I can do is lay there and cry. Getting out of bed is excruciating, but staying in bed is also excruciating. I find myself spending hours doing nothing but staring at the ceiling. Sometimes I can use my sadness for something like my art, but more and more I've become even so sad that it's to the point where I don't want to draw anymore, let alone do anything else.I dread the nighttime, because I can barely sleep anymore. I usually am up until an ungodly hour stewing in my own sadness, unable to get myself out of my own head. Nothing can distract me from my head anymore. I'm on medications for depression and anxiety (have been a year or so now), but they clearly aren't doing what they're supposed to. I've been like this for so long that people in my life are fucking sick of it (myself included), and expect me to be better by now.  But I'm not getting better, I'm getting worse and worse and I feel like I'm fucking drowning 24/7. I've stopped talking to people because I can tell I bring them down. I don't know how to interact with anyone anymore. I've become so reclusive and don't have a way to really change that, and even if I did have a chance to get myself out there and make some more friends and have a life...I know I would fuck it up because I always do. I just don't want to try anymore.I don't know how I can handle making it through tonight, let alone the rest of my pathetic life.I just wish I were dead."
I think my mind is made up..(potentially triggering),"I don't know what the protocol is for this sub but I feel like I just need to get this all out. Forgive me mods if I'm not following strict rules.I'm supposed to be starting my life over in January and going back to school and living with my former partner and right now not even that promise is enough to keep my going.I am very disordered in my eating and it really fucks with my mental state because my discontent with my body keeps me depressed and I'm already bipolar and have a history of anxiety and trauma. My family doesn't understand and I have no friends to speak of.I have a plan in place just don't know when I will do it. I plan to sharpie my name, date of birthe and social security number on my arm and end myself in a rural motel off a small highway. I will leave my ID ij eyesight. There will be no note or last words. It will be an overdose most likely on whatever I can scrounge up, potentially with slitting my wrists as a back up plan if things take too long. I will pay for everything in cash and leave the remainder of my savings to my partner, my family and whoever owns the motel to make up for my mess. I won't quit my job I'll let them find out if my family tells them or if they find out. I will excuse my absence as a short road trip and leave the conclusion to be drawn while I am gone. There will be no last warning. I will disapear.I've had three failed attempts and I feel like I could do it right for once but I just keep waiting I don't know why. I don't care about living.I'm 25, I live with my parents, I dropped out of school after anxiety, depression, PTSd and my eating disorder got the best of me. I came out as bisexual/pansexual and nombinary/non gender conforming and people can't really understand the grief feeling so rejected has caused me. I work a very stressful job where I am overlooked and taken for granted and it just digs me deeper into my illness.I post frequently to  (don't judge because you don't know the community) and get some support there but even with that I still feel like I don't belong.I don't belong anywhere.I feel worthless and like a burden, cliche I know but I feel awful none the less. I just want the pain to go away and to be able to be happy. For people to show they care but I know the world is cold and maybe people like me don't belong.I feel like going away will only make the world a better place.This is where I am..Willow."
"14,000 mg of acetaminophen","I currently have about 14,000 mg of acetaminophen, and I could probably get my hands on more. Is it true that is could take ages to kill me? I just want something quick."
I have a perfect life,"I should have everything I could ever need. Someone else mentioned that they want to switch places with rich people. That's me.
My family is wealthy, even for 1st world standards, I  can get anything I want physically wise. I'm pretty popular in school, make a lot of friends, go to a lot of parties, etc. I'm also pretty smart and combined with the wealth thing I can get into a good college and get a good job etc etc. (High school senior now).
I also have no shortage of emotional attention, a loving family and lots of good friends who genuinely care for me. I'm active with a very fun and enjoyable xc and track teams.
Essentially I have a perfect life as of yet, the quintessential high school stereotype. But I still feel so so lonely, and that no one can understand me yada yada the classic teenage hormone stuff. Sometimes I feel completely worthless and that I let down everyone around me.
On my good days I know this is completely false and on my bad days I know objectively how stupid I'm being. Still doesn't stop the feelings from existing and I don't know how to fix it.
I'm not actively going to go out and do anything to myself--- theres no way I have the strength of will to do that. In any case I would probably feel too guilty anyway.
I know this is coming off rambling, but I'm completely at a loss for what to do."
I'm sorry..,"I'm going to do it. Tonight. One more hour.. I've come here to see if maybe someone would be able to talk me out of it. I don't think they will, but I hope so. The truth is, I'm scared, and I don't want to do it, but it's the only way out for me. At least, that's what the demons tell me. My life has gone to shit, I'm worthless, and nobody cares."
Monday...,I think Monday should be the day. I'll have seen both of my parents and my grandparents and gotten the chance to say goodbye. I don't have any reason to stay after this. The only problem I have to figure out is where to do it. I don't want anyone to have to clean up behind me.
Best country to commit suicide in?,None. Please don't. Why do you want to die?
Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"So for a little bit of background, here's a timeline.
I've had anxiety issues FOREVER. All through elementary school, I had extreme separation anxiety. It was brushed off as me just being a clingy kid, up until fourth grade. In fourth grade, my anxiety hit an all time record. I missed a shit ton of school and they eventually sent a letter home complaining about it. I started therapy and was prescribed Zoloft. Believe it or not, I had my first semi-suicidal thought in fourth grade. I remember it clearly. ""What if I just wasn't here anymore?""
In fifth grade we moved. That year was okay, but the anxiety stayed strong. In year 6 I became severely depressed and started self harming. This lasted until year 7. Basically, middle school sucked ass. Now I'm a high school student and things are bad again. I just don't know anymore. I feel I've tried everything. So much medicine and hours of therapy... breathing exercises, meditation, nothing helps. Also, school. I cannot handle the stress. It makes everything so much worse but whenever I mention homeschool or something like it my mom gets pissed off and yells at me. It's worse because we all know i can do the work. This year I literally didn't show up the last semester of school due to surgery and I passed with honors. If you've made it this far, thank you. If anyone has any ideas or other coping mechanisms I would love you forever. I'm honestly so lost right now and suicide is so tempting.  "
I had to go back on meds,I've had suicidal thoughts off and on for years. No reason to have them. I have what everyone would consider a good life. Great even. I have severe anxiety and depresssion. Started when I was young. 39 now. I've been on all kinds of meds since I was 20. Will go off and on. Finally in may I decided I was tired of feeling numb and emotionless so I got off everything. But the last few weeks have been terrible and I've thought so much about death that I just called my doctor and asked to be put back on meds. I'm so dissapointed but I hope they will cut down the anxiety and depression.
Why even bother,"I have dealt with on and off abuse for 6 years and If I dont get out now then I wont have any chance at transitioning healthily into adulthood.
Ive asked so many people if they have a place for me to stay so I can escape this but noone is financially able to help me.
I'm contemplating just killing myself at this point."
No one ever wants me,"The only person who ever really gave a shit about me stopped responding to my pleas for help, and the next time I get to see them in person for help isn't for a few days, and I doubt if I can make it through tomorrow"
I wish i was never born,My one and only wish for the rest of my eternity on this ball of shit called earth. Humans should stop breeding

Today It Really Just Feels Like It Will Never Get Better,"So, I posted here once before. I never replied to anyone, but I did read all the things people said. I also managed to work up the courage to speak with a friend, but I feel like that particular resource is no longer available to me.For a little back ground, I was born in to an ultra conservative Christian family. I knew from a young age I was different, but I actually never swayed from conservative views until well in to my 20s. See, I am transgender. But, ignoring the politics I was raised in, I was raised to be respectful and loving and loyal to family and God above all. So when my family and church and the people around me in life (most of whom didn't have a single clue about my 'misdeeds', if you will) preached and taught me that is wrong... I took it to heart. I tried to constantly fight myself and to fix myself and rooted myself deeply in my conservative and Christian views, to the point of blocking out my vast amount of world experience I had already accumulated by my teenage years (nine countries, forty four states).Growing, especially through the teenage years, I had a lot of mental bouts. I didn't know it at the time, because I came so good at hiding myself from others and thus never sought psychiatric help, I now realize I definitely faced some pretty serious, likely clinical level, depression. I did attempt suicide once, at the age of 12. I took a knife, applied it to my arm enough to draw blood... and got scared. Not of dying, but of pain. And I would have felt even worse trying to explain it if I survived because I quit halfway through since I was already so timid.Flash forward and the on and off depression and constant acceptance with myself, followed by swiftly denouncing what I was to prove how good of a person I am just took its toll. Until, finally, at the age of 29, I was sure I had to do something. I was dying and miserable inside and it went from occasional suicidal thoughts, to overwhelming daily recurrences.I officially began my transition shortly before my thirtieth and went through a lot of emotions and difficulty wondering how my world would change. I always knew not everyone would accept me, but that's ok. We all have people that inexplicably don't like us. I feel like a generally good person (not perfect), but I do try to give back every chance I get and to help others when I can.Sure enough, when I told my family, the vast majority of them (all of which are alive up to, and including, both sets of grandparents) turned on me and won't even speak to me. This is a family that taught my family was EVERYTHING and I had never had a bad reputation amongst my family, never missed Thanksgiving or Christmas, etc. The biggest blowup was just a couple days before my 30th birthday when my sister basically blasted trans people, told me she was boycotting Target and completely ruined MY birthday dinner.But I moved on and the transition continued far better than I could have ever hoped. There were bumps and fears and then the really awful month of March I had earlier this year. But, finally, I began presenting at work. And starting with the day before, I basically experienced the ABSOLUTE best two weeks of my life. Gone was my anxiety. No one treated me poorly, no one misgendered me. People asked about my boyfriend/husband/kids. People asked me so questions or made comments that you'd definitely ONLY make to women. All of it was so uplifting and affirming. And so, after those two weeks, I of course wanted to share my happiness with those closest to me.Naturally, a couple family members who I had never removed decided that this was a bad thing and thus began the attacks. Name calling, hate, getting my ten year old niece who has absolutely no part in this involved to make me feel guilty, my sister demanding an apology (note: I haven't called or texted her since she cut me off, I did attempt to speak to her once in person at work and she brushed me off and I gave up) for only God himself knows what when she's the one who completely cut me out of her life and ruined my birthday. Finally, I had a bad day at work the next day and to just make everything perfect, my grandmother posted immediately after (not knowing about the work thing) that I was a 'tragic mistake'.This may be hard for some people to understand. If you're not trans, you won't understand the feeling of gender dysphoria. If you weren't raised in the way I was, you may not understand that family is a cornerstone of my life, even the bad apples. You leave no one behind. I don't understand hate period, which I'm really beginning to wonder how I ever developed that worldview, considering apparently such a large sect of the people who I spent most of thirty years with and who raised me and helped shape my values do.I don't have a ton of friends. I spent too much of my life stuck in my own head and, like most people, once you're in your 30s, making new friends can be a little more difficult than, say, high school and college. My three closest friends, as much as I love them, are very poor sources of support with depression. One is a guy who doesn't talk feelings, basically ever. He's like that guy from Futurama from the neutral planet. Another has had the worst life of anyone I know, every choice he makes backfires and every person he lets in to his life seems to be a disaster and his family disowned him LONG before mine did such a thing to me. So, if I try to talk about depression, he turns it in to a game of one-upmanship. Finally, my closest friend right now is an eternal optimist, the kind who believes you just need to smile more and HATES talking about anything negative.At this point, I'm just tired of fighting. I have made no meaningful contribution in this life I can see. I come home to an empty apartment every day. My parents have literally never stepped foot in ANY apartment with my name on the lease (except a single time when my dad helped me move in a new dresser).I mean, really, I just see nothing of value. And I cry a lot. And I don't want to feel this way every day of my life, it was the whole point of transitioning. And I thought I was doing really well, until my family reminded me how awful of a human I must be. I even finally typed out a suicide note and reached out to a couple places to look in to a will. I still don't fear death. I still always hope I just don't wake up one day or that some idiot on the road fixes all of my problems. I just know that I never asked to be trans and it kills me that my family would so easily toss me aside like I never meant anything to them. I just don't see any point moving forward if it means feeling like this every day. "
I lied to myself.,"Two weeks ago I was ready to give up on myself. I'm not sure why but I decided to talk to a friend to see how she was doing. She asked how I was, I told her about my situation and suggested I see a therapist, or at the very least tell my family. So first week of class I started to feel myself wear down throughout the day and decided to tell my brother. So I did, I promised him I would call the psychiatric department of the hospital to see when I could get an appointment. Only available was during school hours and I decided against it, the lady I talked to was real nice, told me to call in the morning I want the appointment to see if it was free that day. I never called back.I guess since I had always kinda been like this I always had something. I've been getting worse I can barely sleep, with every day it seems less and less of a good idea to call. What happens to me if have to take medication, how different will I be, how different will I feel with every day. Where my mind is right now, it's hard to remember some stuff, I don't know what I like, or what I would want to do, I barely have any drive to finish high school. I'm not sure where this part would be better suited. I can't tell if I like this one person, or if it's my mind just trying to cling onto anything that can make me smile."
Depression is coming back...,"I've always had a ""suicidal"" part of me, since I was a kid. I tried twice, but both times my sister entered the room just in time and went to tell our mother who lost it and called all the ""pros"" there are.I [M30] am now in a not so great relationship which will likely end this year if nothing happens.The worst part with this kind of depression from which I suffer is that I don't know why I feel this way. It's the exact same feeling from when I was in my early teens. It's a feeling of complete loneliness (even though I'm not lonely, I, for now, have a gf and I have my two kids).Is a feeling of not knowing what and if there can be anything done to kill the pain.This feeling is the only one who ever made me consider finishing it all. There's no ""antidote"". I don't know what I want, so it's pretty impossible to find a solution, unless it's final."
I'm going to suicide I just don't know why,"Thing is, I've been discussing it with myself for a while now, hell even with a long distance friend and I personally think I have no regards for my life whatsoever.
I'm 17 years old, male, but I'm on that side of guys who are way to sensitive for anything at all. I'm weak, short, ugly, thin, unhealthy both physically and mentally and I certainly do not feel loved or cared, or that I thus matter to anyone.
I've planned everything out so far, I'm doing it on December because it is a special occasion, and well maybe I'm just hoping things will get better by that time.
It just helps the feelings sharing/contacting with other people, at least until the day comes. A few of the things that are holding me back are my family, and if a kid ends up finding my corpse while playing in the woods, I seek no harm toward others.Thank you for reading till the end, not that it matters anyhow."
Agoraphobia,Haven't been out of the house in 5 weeks. This morning I took extra xanax and made it to a small grocery store. I sweated and cried during the entire trip. My shirt was drenched. The cashier looked at me like I was having a nervous breakdown (I am). But at least I finally got a little food in my home. I was gone 22 minutes. It felt like a week.
Wrote a note,Can't see the point in going on. I can't live solely for the sake of others anymore. I tried cutting myself but the blade was very dull. If i ask for help it will just make things worse and i cant afford a psych ward bill. I'm done.
"My life is objectively great, but...","suicide just seems like such an appealing option. There's a laundry list of reasons why I'm drawn to it - I feel broken, bored, alone, etc - and the list is constantly morphing. After perusing this subreddit for only a day, I feel like y'all would understand. I could expound on the why, but that would require an entire essay. And this is my first post (be gentle, etc), so I'll try to keep it short. I'll give some context. I hate admitting this, but my fickle depression stems, in part, from the women I've loved in my life, and losing them almost entirely due to my own nature. It is exacerbated when my mind wanders to them, either randomly or via reminders e.g. Snapchat stories on Labor Day Weekend (LDW). I can elaborate if anyone cares, but I'm not really looking for anyone to care, just for a space in which I can babble about my current feelings. Because fleshing my thoughts out has always been therapeutic for me to some extent, and reading this subreddit has made me realize that perhaps it can be therapeutic for some of you, in a solidarity sort of way.And honestly, that vague sense of solidarity has been getting me through tonight. I'm a medical student currently on 24 hour surgery call (by virtue of being in medical school alone, I realize I am incredibly fortunate - a piece of the whole ""my life is objectively great""). I feel absolutely amazing when I get involved in patient care - it's almost like a drug. But just like most drugs, withdrawal is a bitch. Every weeknight I go back home & curl up in bed alone, finding solace in mentally orchestrating my own death until I fall asleep. So right now I'm in a weird place. It's a slow LDW Saturday at the hospital and I'm not really needed anywhere. I haven't done anything for a couple hours now, and my mind is starting to wander into the usual dark places - but this time, it's happening in my one safe haven. The idea of getting through medical school so I can devote my life to patient care is one of the few reasons I persist. If I lose this, if this sanctuary gets tainted by my misaligned & maladaptive thoughts, then what am I left with?"
How do I get help from friends without seeming like a complete jackass?,"I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and am splitting really hard recently. People are either my friends or they hate me; I am either full of confidence and hope- which is fine most of the time- or I just want to kill myself for tanking so low so fast and suddenly feeling like a massive shitheap of a worthless person.I am living with friends currently, but they're much more like close family than just friends- for all the love, we bicker a lot; we've been through a lot and are very forgiving, but on the day-to-day we're all always finding fault among the others. This is not to say we are in any way mean or bad people, we just each expect better of the others among us (and are quick to admit our own flaws, as well).The problem, lately, has been that I am severely depressed because of other outside circumstances (err, almost being murdered by my now-ex on 6/1), and this petty bickering always leaves me feeling like I can do no right. It doesn't matter that two hours ago they were thanking me for responding to their kid in danger, the fact that they're chiding me now for [whatever] is extremely upsetting and the sheer level of upset makes me want to hurt myself [punch myself in the head, usually] and then that stupid impulse makes me angry enough to want to kill myself and then I get stuck in a loop of being angry at myself for being so oversensitive and overdramatic about something so stupid.I need help, and I'm not even sure how anyone can help and I don't know how to ask without seeming like a total attention-seeking ass, or even if there is a response like ""What can we do to help?"" and I'm like ""I don't know"" and I'm back to looking like an ass. I'm not very prideful but, you know, I already kind of feel crappy and so putting myself out there to feel crappier for a minute even if to feel better later is just... I don't know how to do it, other than ""just do it,"" which is so awful I loop back around to the ""this sucks so much I want to kill myself"" feeling over something that objectively shouldn't be that hard.I imagine killing myself in many ways, but I don't know that I could go through with any of them. Just the pain of enduring basic, everyday scenarios is becoming excruciating, and I feel like I'm getting worse rather than better, no matter what I try to do to turn it around.I sought professional help and he recommended DBT, but that takes time to get into and right now every day is getting worse.Any advice out there?"
I wish I could just go somewhere and be put down like a dog.,"I'm only alive because I lack the courage to do it myself. I don't see any hope. He contacted me again, undid what little progress I made, all so he could absolve himself of his own guilt. Now he's done with me again, left me to wallow in my suffering alone, off to live a life where he doesn't have to deal with what he's done. He said he was sorry, but I feel like if he was truly worried about hurting me, he would have left me alone. Now I'm hurt all over again, he doesn't care, and I want to fucking die. I really mean it. I wonder if he actually enjoys doing this to me. I didn't do anything to him, all I wanted was to love him. I just wanted him to love me back. Now all I want is to fucking die and finally be at peace. There is nothing good about life. I don't want to live another 50 plus years of this. Please just put me down. They do it for abused dogs that can't be rehabilitated, why won't they do it for abused people? I have no place in this world except to be shit on. My life has shown me that. I'm an ugly woman, no one wants an ugly woman, not as anything other than a chew toy. I want my ugly face to rot away and be gone, I don't want to live in it anymore. Please kill me. "
Everyday my life gets worse.,"My life gets worse everyday, and everything I try doesn't make anything better. I can't do anything right. All the shit in my life is hemorrhaging and I don't know how much longer I can stay strong. I've tried to kill myself before years ago and swore I'd never try again, but I'm as close as I've ever been before. I have only one friend, and I can't talk to them about it because they'll have my parents intervene and make things worse. I just want to die."
There's no answer. Nothing can fix me.,People like me weren't meant for life. No person should ever feel so empty and so much pain at the same time. My experience isn't even unique. There are so many people in pain who don't deserve it. Life is filled with good people who suffer and terrible people who thrive.  Not everyone can be lucky in life. Not everyone is meant to survive. Some of us were meant to be selected against. Some of us just weren't equipped to deal with the tragedies of the world. I can't function anymore. Its 11 A.M. on a Saturday and I'm thinking about death.
The closest I have been in a long time,"It is both frightening and freeing all at once.  People think I am getting better. I know the things to say and how to act. I show just enough of the real me to make them think they see it all.But I don't even realize how much I am hiding, because I am hiding it from myself as well. And then there is a night like tonight. Nobody can ever know the truth of just how close I came tonight. I know a lot more about my meds now than I did a couple hours ago. I know which ones will kill me and which ones will only really mess me up. But I'm not telling anyone that. They don't need to know. I need this plan, for later tonight, or tomorrow, or next week. I can't have it taken away from me. And it scares me how tightly I am holding on to this. But I can't let go. "

I'll never be normal.,"I'm an emotionally stunted excuse for an adult. Twenty-five, and I don't know how to forge relationships because I wasn't allowed to go anywhere or have any friends growing up. So now I just don't bother. I got screamed and cursed at whenever I didn't excel at something, so now, even the slightest criticism sends me spiraling into panic. I was only ever good at school; that's all over now. I feel like I don't even know how to function in the real world. I wish I had the strength to say 'screw them,' to rise above it all and come out the other side. But I don't. I'll never be normal. I'm the sum of all the things that were done to me, not the things that I did. But I can change that now, right? Wrong.I'm a spiteful, bitter person. I'll always be a spiteful, bitter person. Today, I instigated a huge fight with my roommate over nothing. I can feel myself becoming the kind of person my parents were. I don't want to live if I'm the bad guy. "
my life has lost all meaning,"I've lost all hope in living and finding happiness.  I've lost the will to live and i just don't know what to do anymore.  I feel like i'm a waste of life and that i should just kill myself.  Everyone at my school treats me like shit even though i try to be nice to anybody.  Everyone thinks i'm gay (even though i'm not) and constantly calls me a fg or a pussy and always says that i'm a piece of shit.  My therapist has been telling me to separate myself from him (which i did) but he keeps persisting and telling me these things.  He makes my girlfriend cry all the time and calls me a pussy for talking about my feelings.  I feel like an outcast and that nobody will ever understand my struggles.  I've been mentally and physically abused by my step mom over the past 2 years.  I had to run 10 miles from home to get picked up bc she was abusing me.  She abuses my dad too but he still won't leave her.  I haven't seen my dad in 9 months and he's made zero effort to come visit me or see me at all.  The last time I saw him was when i got out of the mental hospital after trying to kill myself and cutting myself like crazy.  He acts like he doesn't care about me.  He never calls or texts me.  I've been doing so good in school and sports lately and everybody continues to tear me down.  And now my girlfriend's mom won't let us be together just bc she doesn't know me and that i'm older.  I want to fall back into old habits and just cut myself until i can't anymore.  I can't take this suffering anymore.  I've had depression since i was 8.  It's been almost ten years with it and it's just gotten worse and worse.  My dad left me when I was 3, i watched my mom almost die when i was 12, i've been separated from all of my family since i was 7.  The abuse, the depression, the meds, the cuts, the blades, the sin.  I'm in so much pain and i just want to rest 6 feet deep.  I'm not going to suffer anymore.  I can't do this anymore..."
I hate that all the kids in my family are 30 _��_ they are my best friends and there going on with there lives,"Even if you feel behind, it's not too late to work towards something. Life isn't a race. The feelings of jealously tell us when someone has something we'd like, does seeing them make you want something out of life?"
Anhedonia.,"It's going to be like this for the rest of my life. There's no point. Hotlines don't do anything and the only reason I'm still here is because I don't have the means to do it properly and I'm not worth the hospital bill when I inevitably fail. There's no fucking point for me being here anymore, no one gives a shit anymore I've worn out my welcome all my friends just tell me to talk to a professional instead because they're tired of hearing me whine about my inane fucking problems and the professionals all want me hospitalized when i CANT FUCKING AFFORD TO BE HOSPITALIZED AND NO ONE CARES. NO ONE CARES ANYMORE. I'm still fucking drowning and there's nothing I can do. I'm fucking done. I don't know what to do."
Immediate.,"I'm sitting on the top of a scaffolding 6 floors high.
Idk I want to die so badly and the things keeping me are vanishing. I'm loosing it.
The only things keeping me are friends and they are all asleep.
Nobody is there..."
I want help I just can't have it.,"I've talked to therapists, several in fact. They all managed to make me feel worse. I can't see a psychologist the nearest that takes my insurance is a 3 hour dive so 6 hours round trip. I don't feel comfortable talking to a doctor all the ones I have seen haven't been able to address my physical issues so I am highly doubtful in their ability to address my mental concerns. I don't have family that I can trust they all are abusive or very close to other family that is abusive. I don't have any friends I can talk to, I've tried and one told me life is worth it because it rains and that kind of shit isn't helpful. I feel trapped and like my only way out is suicide."
It feels like I'm about to lose the most important person in my life and I'm already on the edge,I've dealt with cutting and suicide in the past and now I feel like I did back then except now I think I'm about to lose the most important person in my life. I was already on the edge of ending it before and now I just feel more helpless. my chest only ever feels empty and I have nothing keeping me here. what do i do in my situation
I don't want to keep going,I feel like I can't keep going I've been in bed all day and there's so many problems but I can't do them because I can't get up. I've cut really bad the last couple of days and I think I got my limit. I don't want to live anymore. I don't see the point in life I can't keep up. I can't even get out of bed and there's stuff that has to get done. I don't even know why I'm writing this I'll probably slice my leg open and forget my problems until I sink again. I don't even know why I try anymore it feels useless. It really feels useless everything feels bad. I've planned out my suicide I just need to do it. I want to do it but I can't. I don't even like life and I don't have it in me to shoot myself. I don't even know why I'm writing this I doubt anyone cares I'll just feel worse when I post it. I just want life to be over I don't want to keep going on like this I can't.
I feel like I can never escape this,"I've suffered from major depression, social anxiety, and ADHD for 11 years now. There have been multiple times I planned and tried to kill myself: in 2011, in 2015, and just two days ago, to name a few. My life has technically improved, I just got married this June, and while we don't have kids yet, we do have cats we consider our children. I love them so much. I'm going to college for a career I'm passionate about (music education). I think my life is technically fulfilling, but I still want to die. Ever since Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington died this year, it has made me wonder. These guys had families and successful careers, but even then they couldn't escape depression. It made me realize I'll never be able to escape these tendencies no matter how great my life is, and that's fucking terrifying to me. I've dealt with depression and suicidal feelings for 11 years and still haven't escaped. I don't wanna get too deep into having a family if I'm just gonna kill myself eventually. I might as well back out of life now. "
Back at it,"So here we are back at it again. This morning I was upset because I was reminiscent of the days where I actually had friends. I tried to tell me him about it and he told me to stop whining about something stupid. OK fine maybe it was stupid. Then I got threatening texts with him saying stuff ""then go out and make some friends you loser"" and "" I effing hate you."" Im getting very close to calling the police because I am starting to believe his lies. Do I want to disrupt his life? Do I want to disrupt my life? The answer is obviously no. So I tried calling the National Suicide Prevention hotline. I was on hold for a good ten minutes before I hung up. Maybe I should just go to the police at this point and be done with it. "
Fuck childline,I SWEAR THESE FUCKS JUST MADE ME MORE ANGRYYou are supposed to be able to call them till you are 19 if you are feeling suicidal or depressedNow I have a really deep voice and I sound a lot older then I'm actuallyI tried to call them 3 fucking times and every single time they called bullshit on my age and suggested other hotlines I CANT FUCKING HELP I SOUND LIKE I'M 45 GOD DAMM IT
Nothing in my favor,I don't know what to think. I just want to say my feelings. I can't get any girl I want and I have nobody to go to prom with. I am so lonely and I hate it. I think I just want to be with God.
Alone,"I've been hopelessly alone my whole life. I had abusive and awful parents, and then an abusive and awful spouse.I'm always alone. Sometimes people match with me in online dating platforms, but, after one or two dates they just disappear, even though I think we click just fine. I'm starkly unattractive and genuinely unloveable. I don't really have friends; just coworkers who I see maybe twice a year outside of work (my ex-spouse saw to the idea that I should be alienated from all our mutual friends).I've always had suicidal thoughts, but, lately when I have them I feel a lot more relaxed instead of anxious. Whenever I go to a counsellor or talk with anyone for help, they say it gets better. I'm in my late 30s, and it does not get better, and it doesn't seem like it ever will. I don't even know who I'd leave a suicide note for. Do people even leave them? Why bother."
I'm sitting on my bed with 40 pills of oxy and I don't know what to do,"So I haven't been having the greatest time recently. I have bad anxiety that's been getting worse as I get older. I recently found out that I'm bipolar. My best friend killed himself, and 2 other people I thought were my friends betrayed me. My parents are never home. Things I used to have fun doings aren't fun anymore. Yet despite all this, I thought life was looking up. I had a girlfriend that I thought loved me. Maybe she even did. But she broke up with me after telling me she was faking it for the last 4 months.I've never felt this bad before. I've always worked through it. I even went to a therapist. But all I have ahead of me is a year of school with no friends and nothing to do. And then I have college. But what's the point to dragging out my existence?I don't know why I even posted here. Maybe I'm just looking for someone to throw me a pity party. Ha ha. But I'm sitting here with these pills in my hand trying to work up the courage to take the last leap and I can't even do that. Or maybe I can.Just someone please convince me it gets better because I can't fucking deal with this.Edit: alright guys sorry but I'm going. Crushed the pills put them in water. Wrote a note. I'm real scared  but I think I'll feel better in a few minutes. Sorry"
The temptation was very real today.,"I decided to have a bath today which happened to coincide with a breakdown. I cut myself in the bath, wanting it to go deep. I decided againt my wrists because of the thought of my mum wanting to have a bath and breaking down having to look at where i died"
"Going in for surgery soon, maybe its better if I don't wake up","I'm thinking I'll rather be dead than having chronic pain. My mistakes made life unfortunate but I can't take really much more physical painI don't know how to behave myself. I think that people have busy lives and I don't see myself adding any kind of value to their lives. Friendship is just a weird thing for me.I mean, I haven't always been this way, or maybe I did. I had pretty awesome friends in my youth but one committed suicide and the other isn't interested in keeping contact. I remember not really knowing how to advance friendships. I have been having vivid dreams about it and I hate myself for my choices. I just don't know. Life is bearable of course but the pain of every other suffering in life and the indifference around me is just making me want to escape all my problems.I'm even rambling here and I don't believe any word I say about myself. I criticize my thoughts to the point that I can only come to the conclusion that I'm a loser and anti-social, even though my reasoning may be right, and it makes me want to cry.There is no way I can change this world. It is far too late to change anything about the world at all. Why? Simply because everyone is too selfish. And it will kill everything and everyone."
Suicidal Ideations of After I'm ~40,"Let me start by saying I've been depressed for years, currently on Zoloft and some other junk. I've been doing better, and don't really want to die yet. However, I can't help but think I'll kill myself decades down the line. I'm a freshman, 18,  and I'm planning for my dream job, life, and none of it is too fancy. However I feel like once I've achieved those things and experienced happiness for a time I'll kill myself knowing I pushed past high school and all of life's bullshit for a worthy reward, then game over. It kind of scares me to think that way, but I don't know how to stop it. It's a future problem I guess, but I just don't know. It's all so overwhelming. Even when I'm doing better I can only see one way out, the same way in my darkest moments. "
every week im back to this,started this semester again thinking everything would be ok. applied for some jobs then i hit one little roadblock in a class and i make a rash decision and drop it. im a pathetic loser all there is to it. couldnt even finish the first assignment in the class. want to just drop every other class im taking and be the fuck done with it all. no way im going in for any interviews anymore now either. at least i had the courage to cut myself for this first time tonight so thats a plus. dont even know why the hell im bothering posting this. nobody ever bothers to help me out or anything
"I can't make change. People are always evil, for no reason.","When I realize that I can't make change in this world and that it's always gonna stay evil, I lose my motivation to work and advance my life, because what's the point? I'm not very depressed but this thought comes up sometimes and gives me suicidal urges and feelings. Any advice?"
Rambling,"Im not very good at writing so.I can't even tell what im doing for attention anymore. Everything feels like im grasping at straws. I think depression was just the ""coo thing to do"", and i just fucking lied and said I had it. But now every night i go to sleep feeling shitty and wanting to die. I don't even know if its depression. And then every morning i wake up with nothing to do and i don't have the energy to hang out with friends. I literally just sit at home and play video games everyday. Also im to fucking young to tell if i have depression. Nothing is even solidified in me yet. How can i fucking have depression and not even be put of high school. I also have this fucking selfish need to be different and special. What the fuck is wrong with me. I hooked up with two guys and now im ""poly sexual"". Like it was the cool thing but i barely even have sexual thoughts about either gender, and i can only get off to porn about girls. Again, it started with gay being the cool thing to do, then i provably just convinced myself of it. I don't even want to die. Im terrified of dying. And i don't even want to not exist either, like i want to live but i hat like 10% of it or something, and im just fucking magnifying it to have something concrete. Sorry for even posting here. Im not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I didn't even say anything interesting or anything. Im just fucking, i don't even know."
"Don't exactly want to die, but I'm not really bothered by living either.","I've been getting healthy. Taking my meds (almost) every day. Found the right combo of medication. Seeing a therapist, etc. The usual. Until tonight. I can't seem to find a job.. the one I desperately want I know I won't get. I haven't got a single penny to my name. I just feel useless and without direction. WTF am I to do with my life? Not to mention the fact I've gained 40lbs and can't seem to shed it no matter what I do! I've got a little bit of Klonopin prescribed to me that's left. I never wanted to abuse it again (I've had some close calls) but I can't help but love the numbness it gives me. I've taken 4.5mg and currently drinking a bottle of wine. Hoping the husband doesn't find out. I just moved back to the U.K., too, so the MH care here is.. well.. shit.Anyone been in this spot? Does it get better? Does anyone even know what they want to do with their lives? "
I don't have friends,and I never will. because I'm ugly and boring and anxious. and I'm not funny and I'm not interesting and nothing about me is good or likeable. I'm a fucking failure reject. No one gives a shit about me. If I died tomorrow it wouldn't even fucking matter. All people see when they look at me is an ugly piece of shit and when they get to know me I'm not any better. I'm just a waste of space
Struggling,"I had my first bout of depression back in 2004 when my grandpa died. I nearly killed myself back then. Choked myself out with a PS2 controller. I was 13 and felt like I had nothing left. I bonded with my cat and for the longest time, He was the reason I kept going. He was like a brother to me and there was nothing I wouldn't have done for him. He died in 2014 at the age of 14. He was the perfect cat. That sunk its claws into me. I remember a month before he died, I had a strange dream we were outside and got surrounded by a gang of wasps that just kept stinging away. I had the chance to escape and I did for a brief time but they surrounded him. I came barreling back in and used my body to shield him only to black out in said dream and find out he passed away in said dream. Woke up and saw him laying on the couch. I hugged him and kissed him. Told him how much I loved him. He died a month later. July 2nd 2014, He was put down and I found out after I got out of work. All I could do was cry. There went one of the few people in my life I cared about and loved more than anything. I love my parents but I don't have any relationships with the rest of either side of the family. Fast forward to last year. I was desperate and lonely so I started paying for adult entertainment. It was like $50 here and $50 there. It wound up going up to 15k in a year. I was lonely and still am. Thought to myself, Screw it. Might as well enjoy myself because I deserve it. Got tired of working and getting nowhere so I decided to treat myself. Then that erupted into a huge fight because my parents found out how much i spent. I am lucky I still have a roof over my head. Then, My Dad tried to get advice from somebody at work on how to deal with me and next thing you know it spread around the whole plant. Everyone knows I am a dirty individual with issues. I had alcohol issues in the past. I haven't drank in over 3 years. It gets to that point where you get so lonely and stressed. I tried talking to my therapist but his answer is, ""Well if you would go out and meet people, you wouldn't be upset."" Its kinda hard to meet people when you are stuck working a meat grinder type schedule of 5 12 hour days a week trying to pay this off and not getting anywhere. My debt is at that point where either bankruptcy or just ending it all are good options. All the shame and embarrassment I have caused my parents over the years. "
I think im going to kill myself tonight,"Ive been fighting and suppressing my feelings for so long and I've turned to alcohol and drugs to cope. The more I do it, the less it numbs me. I'm tired of it. I just want it to end. I can't do it anymore. I know that I'm smart and capable but every time I wake up in the morning it gets harder and harder to wake up. I'm done"
"I think my best friend may have done it, and it's tearing me apart.","She's been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now, went to the hospital on Monday, got released that evening.  We text almost constantly, yesterday morning she just stopped.  Nothing.  She can and does access her messages on her computer, so her phone being broken isn't an explanation.  She lives a few hours away and I can't drive.  I have no way to get to her, and I don't know her address.I'm terrified that she has killed herself.  I don't know what to do and I feel like my whole life is unraveling.Edit: she texted me this morning.  She's alive, but 'doesn't want to talk right now.' so I'm giving her some spac e"
I can't like with BPD anymore,"my mind is everything i am , if i don't have that then i have nothing. i just hurt someone else who did nothing but care about me because i cant fucking control how i feel, i swear i shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore. i'm letting go "
"None of you even give a shit, do you?",I'm done.
I wish I would die so I wouldn't have to kill myself.,"I wish I had an excuse to die. I wish I would be hit driving home one day. I wish I would get mugged and shot. I wish I'd get hit crossing the street. I wish I had cancer. I know it's selfish. And fucked of me to even think things like that. I just really wish I had a way to die without killing myself. You get to die without leaving anyone mad at you. My family doesn't deserve as someone as fucking pathetic as me. I don't want to hurt them. But I'm hurting so much. But no one knows. No one cares. All my ""friends"" have slowly left and can I fucking blame them? I wouldn't be my friend either. I'm so terrified of life. I'm so terrified of trying to end my life. I'm so terrified of fucking that up like everything else. I'm so tired of being alone. I'm so tired of having to pretend everything is okay. Im so tired of being a fucking loser. I'm so tired of life."
My Cat,"I've never posted anything online ever. After losing my dog of 15 years in April, I was left with my pet cat who is only got in March. He was killed in the road yesterday. He was only 2. It's not the same as my dog, who I know had a fantastic life and was put to sleep painlessly. My cat has been stolen from me in such a brutal, painful manner and his life stolen from him by a driver doing 50 in a 20 zone.In some cruel twist of fate I saw it all unfold right before my eyes. I was walking back from the shops near to my house. In the distance I saw a black shape crossing the road. He was trying to come to home. I sprinted to meet him, but he disappeared from my sight. He must be under one of the parked cars I thought.Then I saw him. He was crawling into the road, his back legs dragging on the floor. I ran into the road and picked him up on in my arms. He was shaking, convulsing. Blood was all around his mouth. Within a minute he was limp in my arms. People were standing round watching. The driver of the vehicle stopped and addressed me. He said something about the cat coming out of nowhere and asked if he was ok. I simply said he was dead, and he offered an apology before leaving. I can't get the image of him in my arms out of my mind. The pain is too much to bear anymore. Whether he's there or not if there's a chance my boy is alone then I need to be with him. I need to look after him the way I didn't before. I could have kept him indoors but he was an outdoor cat. He was always careful crossing the road (I live by a woods, he liked to explore). But I shouldn't have let him out, he'd still be here with me now.Nobody understands the pain I'm in. My parents are growing impatient I can tell. But I'll never be over this. People say you learn to live with these things. But I don't want to learn. And I don't want to live without the sweetest most loving cat I've ever known. Fuck this world."
I'm not strong enough for this,"I have had a rough family life. Lived with an aunt who verbally, mentally and physically abused me while her husband stood aside and watched. Taken by my biological mother at 15, hoping that things will get better. It did, for a few months. From then on it was neglect and being ignored for weeks and weeks with little proper communication. I only had friends to talk to.Years have passed and I still get the same treatment. Just this morning, I saw the smile leave my biological mother's face when she saw me entering the kitchen. I just found out few minutes ago that my biological mother actually contacted my boyfriend and told him not to see me or she would never give her blessing for our relationship. Important to note that my boyfriend is one of the few things keeping me tethered and mentally stable. It turns out she has been keeping him from coming to see me the past few weeks.It's my birthday today and he promised he would come but he can't cuz my biological mother won't allow him to see me.I have been harbouring my suicidal tendencies the past few months but I have tried my best to keep it at bay because I know I still have my boyfriend, I'm clinging onto the last hope of building a future with him. After finding out my biological mother is actively stopping him from seeing me, it all came backPlease help me. I already planned to go jogging in the morning and killing myself during that time cuz I simply can't bear all this pain anymore. I never felt more lonely in this world than I am after finding out the truth just now"
"(PLEASE DON'T REMOVE THIS!) I owe about $125k in student loans, with private loans. With no hope of paying them off, I plan to end it all by jumping from a height.","Foreword: Why did you remove this the first time?I plan on giving this letter to the front desk person of the building that I plan to jump off:To whom it may concern,This letter is for any front desk personnel. When your staff recovers my body, donate my organs to anyone needing them. Also, donate other parts of my body to science. Nobody is to cremate my remains after scientific entities are finished with my body.I have left hair samples ��� DNA samples with which to clone two copies of me when the science of human cloning matures.I am too deep in student loan debts ��� about $60,000 in private loans alone, and $125,000-$130,000 in total student loans after interest as of August 2017, and with no hope of paying them off, so I am planning to end my life by going to the rooftop and jumping off.In the unlikely event that this letter finds a benefactor while I�۪m still alive, my bank routing number is #101-101-293 and bank account number is #511-030-355.No lawyer in town will take on a bankruptcy case for my student loans. (It IS possible, in some circumstances, to discharge student loans in bankruptcy. Student loan bankruptcy cases are however more complex.) I would not have the money for a lawyer anyway, so I would have needed a pro-bono lawyer in this case.There is no income-based repayment for private loans. The minimum payments are so high, I would become homeless from being forced to make them.It appears that no amount of prayers will bring a miracle to this situation.My body is not to get cremated, only buried. My government disability status should entitle me to a funeral and burial paid for by the government. Should you lose my hair samples, feel free to exhume my body to extract further DNA samples when it is almost cloning time.My clones are not to be developed straight to the growth stage of adulthood, but to start at the growth stage of about 5 years old, if growth stage acceleration is possible. Otherwise, the clones may be born the normal way (or through an artificial womb) if need be. My clones are to be taught NEVER to take out student loans, but instead, work and save up for community college.I�۪m so sorry that I went in way over my head hoping that my life would succeed to where I�۪d pay off these loans somehow, and that my life has failed miserably.Regrettably,"
Mental break is going to happen,"I went through the AskReddit thread earlier about people witnessing mental breaks, and I realized halfway through that that's exactly where I'm heading. I'm already starting and I know I'm going to hit it hard when it finally happens. I give it a year tops lol. "
dying,xanax. death. i�۪m too young. i am so scared. it�۪s over.
Sometimes I think I've been in the grieving stage of every problem for my entire life...,"My first idea about whether I wanted to kill myself happened when I was 7 years old. I wanted to die by running in front of a car because I thought I was a bad person and I'd only get worse later on (raised Mormon). Then it returned again in my adolescence. Suicide was always my friend when I was feeling bad at that point. Had my first attempt this year. Now every time I have a bad day or a bad week, or even a bad month, I know how strong our bond was. Like an ex, turned stalker, I am now afraid of what has been my comfort for YEARS. I had no idea how much of my life I've seen it as a comfort, but I think around 12 years. The only time it ever came to my mind as being dangerous was AFTER I had my first attempt. Until that point, I had no idea how strong the urge had become. I was found by a neighbor and haven't checked the medical record yet to see how bad I was, but I was out cold for 3 days. I am still trying hard every day, but some days I wish I could flee my home and live homeless doing whatever I need to do to stay alive. Maybe the hunger would help me contemplate hunger again and this need would fill my very empty void with the feeling of my body needing to live instead.
I don't know how to say this right, but suicide scares the hell out of me, but I feel like maybe life isn't a choice for me and I could let my hungry body find a way for me to survive, instead of my hurt mind. I'm bipolar, had an attempt, and still think of it. It embarrasses me so much when I still think about it even after the first time."
What is the point in living if I cannot even imagine what happiness will look like?,"I really have no idea what happiness will look like for me in the future. As much as I say I want a relationship, I know I will just be exploited because no one cares about someone unless they are after something. I know a relationship is not the path to hapiness because they are temporary at best.��My hobby of playing on computers all day messed up my back and I had to go to a chiropractor to get relief. I'm afraid to even do what I previously like to do, but it was stupid to be wasting time on it anyway. No one takes me serious because of it.��I got a worthless degree that sucks up most of my income. I guess in about 8 years I won't have loans anymore, but extra money can't buy happiness anyway.��I thought happiness would be playing video games or finding someone who makes the world seem like a decent place, but neither will help me.��I just don't see a point in living if I won't find happiness."
What happens if I call the emergency room?,"My psychiatrist knows I struggle with suicide thoughts, especially since I've already attempted to kill myself last April. She told me if I ever felt unsafe that I would harm myself that I should try calling the suicide hotline or the emergency room. I was wondering what the emergency room would even do if I call them? I haven't felt good at all lately and have been having thoughts of killing myself and have been thinking about calling the emergency room but I'm afraid what they might do. The last time I was in the ER was after my attempt and being watched closely while I had a bunch of needles in me then I was put in a psych unit for a week. "
"Deserve to die, was terrible to my ex","This happened months ago, but I dated a guy for 4 months who had a lot of anger problems. We didn't bring out the best in each other. I ended up breaking up with him one day right after we had sex.I feel like a terrible person who took advantage of someone. I was so afraid to break up with him, partly because he had a temper, partly because I knew he would be crushed. I'd tried to break up with him before, but he begged and told me he was so lonely.Also, previously, an ex had a restraining order against him because he threatened her when she broke up with him. And he'd had the cops called on him for threatening someone else too. So all that was in the back of my mind.But still, nobody deserves to be broken up with right after sex. I knew I was going to end it, but I was a coward and an idiot and waited until the last minute. Kept changing my mind. He texted to me later to say he felt taken advantage of. I apologized again and again. But I still feel so guilty and abusive. I don't deserve a happy life after this. "
Easiest way,"So was thinking of drinking so many liters of water and hopefully ill die from overhydration, because if i fail and dont die its the least likely to cause irreversible damage right? The worst that can happen is a splitting headache right?I dont know what the easiest way to end it all would be. I just want the pain to end. "
Gathering courage,What do you need the courage for?
Drama Drama,"Today I stood in the highway. I made sure it was in a 90-zone, on a blind curve, and I made sure to stand in front of the gravel patch so nobody lost control on it trying to avoid me.
I was ALMOST taken out by a truck-camper combo, and again by a hatchback civic. Both of them braked, swerved. One asked if I was okay, I told her to fuck off. She did.I read posts here and it becomes tiring. Everyone feels so STRONGLY. They rant and rave and draw it up and spell it out and justify and compare and make double-sided self-deprecating comments originally designed to attract pity, or sympathy,  whilst simulataneously claiming to not.Then, the responses. ""You're irreplaceable, you're special, you're loved etc.. etc..."" Or ""Things will get better, they improve, you're worthy and will be redeemed""Maybe y'all a bunch of some fucking persistent breed of unicorn, but lemme' tell ya: it doesn't.  I'm as special as the next whacker-kid. My talent, whilst well-honed, is cookie cutter shit I've used to validate my existence for too many years. My ""intelligence"" is a mistakenly identified obsessive streak developed to scare people out of criticizing me. My ""energy"" is an unchecked anxiety disorder I treat with high (1500+mg) dose caffeine and assorted amphetamines.My ""sweet"" streak isn't enough for anybody, my ""smart"" isn't enough to trust, my ""humour"" is appreciated from a pity-point. I just, don't care. Maybe I'll get hit by a car. Maybe I'll die in a car accident. Maybe I'll OD on insulin or codeine, or maybe I'll eat a parabellum.
Or I won't. We'll see. Does anyone see their death coming? Last time I tried this I didn't, and this time I don't either. It doesn't scare me. The realization is clarifying but the act itself is so much work. But who remembers hard work when it was done?"
I'm ready to end it.,"My life has been falling apart for months. My sister is successful. My best friend is successful. My life is trash. I can't hold a job. I can't hold friends. Hell my family is falling apart.I have no money, have a shit car. My girlfriend went off to college 2 weeks ago and she just decided to end our relationship because it wasn't working for her. No matter what i said she blew everything off. Yesterday my dad choked me out in the ground and I went to the police. Charges weren't filed and my own mother wouldn't believe a word i said. A family friend who witnessed it completely refuted my story. I got forced out of my home.Every day has been something else fucking me up. I can't think straight. I can't sleep. Barely eat. I went to a therapist and that did fuck all. Im crumbling. I'm ready to drive my self into a brick wall and never look back. I don't want to breathe. I don't want to talk. I'm ready to end it. I have no other way out. I accept death. I beg for it, plead for it every day. I can't go on like this anymore."
fuck you all im out,"Fuck you too.
Wait a minute.."
i deserve this,"i'm a bad person and i deserve to feel this way.I deserve all of this.
I want to die "
What to do when you feel like not wanting to live anymore?,"Right, so to make it clear, I'm not going to commit suicide. But I feel like I wouldn't mind someone else shooting me in the head.I'm a tenth grader. My life should be amazing. There is basically no major issues in my life or the lives on my family members. Everything is great. Except I don't get to enjoy it. I wear a cloak of depression and sadness or maybe anxiety all the time. Happy moments are few and they feel like my body just pretending to be happy. They just partially distract me from my sadness. I can't really think of anything else to say. Advice would be much appreciated."
I am going to quit therapy and meds. I've tried for years and decided life isn't for me.,I'm not upset anymore. I'm oddly relieved. This is the first time in a while I feel in control of whatever happens next for me. I don't think this is necessarily a suicide note. I just want to get my feelings out there. I don't want to fight in this life anymore. I simply want peace.
"Lost my only good friend, and going back to live with my parents....","I have been staying with my friend for over a month, and he has been supporting me, it is my first time out of my families house where I live in years..... (in another state). Sadly, We have many disagreements on religious views and politics and he thinks I don't want to help myself, because I dont believe in his god. and he is cutting me off and told me to delete his number. we have been friends for 11 years and he is one of the only people who stood by my side through everything. I kinda blew it though, he also doesn't wanna be around my negativity and mania.... I am going back to live with my psycho religious cult family today.... the place where all my trauma started.....I think I give up.
No point in living.
I can't feel anything, I constantly feel dysphoric and weak and fatigued and overall very shitty.
I have not been getting better and medication doesnt work.
I tried making a gofundme page, to move out of my house, and get medical help, but I didnt get a SINGLE donation.I f*cking give up.
I dont wana do this to my family, but hopefully they will understand.Why should I continue living? I do not want to be here and I can't enjoy anything"
I just attempted to drown myself,"Just now, I sent out a suicide letter to my family. I had my mind made up and went to drown myself at a lake in my neighborhood. I thought that if I inhaled water as soon as I went under that it would not take very long for me to lose consciousness. I must have done something wrong because I was under for what felt like an eternity and tried to take in as much water as possible. I started to struggle for air and held on to some branches in the water in order to stay under. The lake was way more shallow than I assumed. I was literally fighting with my survival instinct and as I lost feeling and started to slip away my head came out of the water and I coughed up a lot of water. I lost feeling in my arms and hands and my head automatically came up. If it was deeper, I think I wouldn't be here right now. That was about an hour ago and I have not been able to stop coughing since. My chest feels terrible. The sad part about all of this is that I am upset that I wasn't successful. "
is it worth living to save the feelings of one person who cares about you?,"The only reason I'm still here is because my brother just left for college: he's a genius and he has a great life ahead of him and he's going to be a great engineer. I'm worried if I kill myself when he's only a few weeks into college it will screw him up and make him fuck up his future.The thing is, my life is just painful enough that I might do it anyway."
Wake up to see the sunrise,"I was sitting at Starbucks today on my lunch break, studying. I almost always go this Starbucks on my lunch break and usually get the same thing - a vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Usually grande, but this time I got a venti. This random chick comes up to me and asks me something. I honestly forget what she was asking me, just heard something about going up to Seattle. She gave me this little sealed envelope, about 3"" x 4"", with ""#29"" written on it. I tell her thanks, gesturing that I would open and read it later, but she insists on me opening the card (I'm assuming to see my reaction). On the side with the flap, there's a little smiley face drawn in blue. Inside is a blue and grey card, with the word ""Thanks"" written and bordered in gold. I opened the card and written inside in pen, and highlighted in a light blue for a nice contrast is ""Wake up to see the sunrise."" I thought about it, and I knew she was waiting for me to smile. I just kind of bobbed my head and thought ""ok..."" I thought about it more, and thought, do I really want to? Do I really want to wake up again and see the sunrise? I start to frown, but then give this girl a little smirk, and she kind of points to me with both hands in that ""there it is"" manner.I had just been turned down for a position at my work. Again. I've been trying to get out of this hell hole for a while now. I've applied for many different positions, all with no luck. I'm going to back to school to hopefully be admitted into a program to finally make something of my life, but for now I need something to get the bills paid and have health insurance.My best friend, or who I considered my best friend, is refusing to talk to me. Calls, texts - all ignored. I had a sinking feeling this would happen after he left (we used to work together), and the last time I talked to him I begged him not to forget about me, and made sure we would still hang out. This is coming on two months ago. I was so close to this guy, my heart aches when I think about it.One of my other close friends I felt I could always rely on hasn't talked to me in months either. She moved away quite a while ago, but we've always maintained a, what I though to be, a good relationship even only via text.I've maintained very few friendships. I honestly don't know why. I've tried to keep in contact with people, hang out with them, build genuine relationships, but they always seem to fall apart. I have such a hard time trusting anybody now because of the most recent events in my life.My sister is very abusive towards everyone in my family - me, my mom, my nephew (her son). She only cares about herself and no one else. She's seemingly always the victim, never at fault (can never accept any fault at all). I've given up on her completely. I don't know how many times I can keep thinking she'll change and that she's my sister, and I should try to care, but I always end up getting hurt.My cousins, they used to be my pillars. They were my closest friends, and I did everything with them. I understand that they have lives of their own, families of their own, I just wish they would keep in touch with me more often. I started to hate going to them whenever I had any problems, and felt like a burden, and the last time I did that really reinforced that feeling. They always told me blood is thicker than water, but it seems this blood has thinned completely out.My POS dad. His attitude screams, money can buy love. He'll buy his grandson, my nephew, my sister's son, all the toys in the world, but would not spend a moment playing with them with him. He cannot stand to be in the same room with his family. Last year on my 26th birthday, my mom reminded him that it was my birthday. All he had to say? ""So? I don't care."" He's commented numerous times on how I'm useless and that I can't do anything on my own and brags about his nieces and nephews halfway around the world. He can be proud of his brother's and sister's kids, but not his own. After a lifetime of essentially being ignored, and as I got older what an asshole he really is, I've pretty much cut him out of my life.My mom. One of the main reasons I'm still here today. She would die from a broken heart if I were to leave her by herself. I love my mom to death, but I don't want to make her feel as if she failed me as a mother; I don't want to make her feel like she did a shitty job raising her kids. I try to do her proud by being decent with finances, and being pretty self-reliant. But sometimes she's just not there for me. I asked her to ask her boss if I could shadow her at work, and she refuses to even ask. She knows that it's would be so helpful to me in getting into this program, but still she refuses to even ask. She knows getting into this program would be life-changing for me, but still, she refuses to try to help me out.I don't have enough money to move out on my own, or even with a roommate for that matter. So I'm banking on getting into this program so I can turn my life around. I've been studying non-stop day and night so I can get my mind off of things like work and home, but in lurks the thought of how much better life would be if I ended mine.The other night, I put on some headphones, put on some sad songs, and poured myself some whiskey. And some more. And more. And more. With each drink, I thought ""God, let me die, just let me die, I hate living."" I crawled into bed thinking, ""please, just let me die. Please. Just let me die.""I woke up to see the sunrise, disappointed.I hope to get through this. I really do. I hope all of you do to. I haven't found what's worth living, but I'm trying to keep living so I can find out. And I hope everyone else who's struggling here does too. We'll all find it, it's just going to take some time. It's hard, now, but maintain hope, even the slightest glimmer of it, don't ever let that small glint of hope go out and let's all forge on."
Just had an intense car crash and absolutely ruined some guys car.,Rn Im in the hospital and just thinking about ending my life. The dude said he was gonna send some of his friends after me and knowing my corrupt shit country i dont doubt him. I should just kill myself now so he won't hurt anyone i care about. I'm poor and this will just make me poorer now. So rip me
Reached the end,"Hi everyone.Tldr at the bottom First let me tell you about myself.
I'm a 26 year old guy from from Sweden. I am currently living and working in Bucharest, Romania.
I have no contact with my family and friends back home in Sweden, basically the only person I have in my life is my Romanian girlfriend.I recently moved to bucharest from a different town in Romania, and my girlfriend is supposed to come join me in two weeks time.Oh, I forgot to say that I am a compulsive gambler.
Gambling has flipped my life upside down many times now.
The first time when I was 21.
I crashed my car and received a big lump sum from the insurance. I went to the casino and lost it all. This is where my addiction started.
I started pushing my family and girlfriend away. I ended up stealing money from my workplace to fuel my addiction. Me and my girlfriend broke up.
One thing lead to another and I moved to Ireland. This was back in 2012.I spent 4 years in Ireland, working and gambling. I didn't save a cent even though I had a pretty good job.
2016, I'm now 25. On top of the gambling I had also become a heavy drinker. Things spiralled out of control. I was depressed, had no friends and two addictions.
April 2016, I stop going to work and get fired.July 2016, I'm out of money and hope.
Out of the blue I get a job offer from a company in Romania. They offer to fly me over and pay me a 1000euro relocation bonus.
I accept the offer and move.August 2016, I start dating a girl. We are still together.January-june 2017, it feels like I started getting out of the gambling addiction.
July 2017, I loose all my savings (4000euro, not much in everyone's eyes but i never had savings before) I have to sell my computers to be able to pay for rent.August 2017, I move to Bucharest. 30th August 2017, I get paid from my new job. Lose it all in casino.2nd September 2017, 3 days until rent is due. I sell my PlayStation (which would have been enough to cover my rent). I headed into town after selling it. I lost the money in the casino. I haven't told my girlfriend that I don't have money for rent and I'm not planning on doing it either.I'm tired of my self destructive behaviour and how it negatively effects my girlfriend.Tl:DrThis is my last weekend alive. Sunday or Monday evening I am getting wasted and then cutting myself in the bathtub.
The only person who knows where I am, my girlfriend, is a 6 hour drive away. She is the only person I have regular contact with, and she is my only bright light in my life. I feel bad doing this as it will affect her so badly, but I think it is better for her to get rid of me.
Kind of sad that losing 220 euro pushed me over the edge."
Tired and done,"I'm absolutely convinced no one cares about me. Nothing has gotten better. I've tried and tried. There is no reason for me to be here any longer. I am tired of living a life that is second best. No matter how much I do, i always get disappointed in the end. My effort towards a better life means nothing at this point."
I'm jealous of people who die.,"I'm 21 years old, female, and I have two kids. 2 years old and 6 months. I don't know how else to start this. I'm getting pretty close to leaving this earth. I want to do it before they're old enough to actually know me. I know I won't be the Mom they need anyways. I'm too fucked up mentally. Anxiety, depression, god knows what else.I feel like I'm losing my mind. I have these moments where nothing feels real. I can't remember anything anymore. Anxiety about everything. In public everyone looks fake. I have so many intrusive thoughts about hurting myself, hurting others. I never ever would. It's just those thoughts that pop into your mind that are so incredibly fucked up. I never used to be like this. Idk what caused this because nothing traumatic happened in the last two years. I'm jealous of people who die naturally (not by their own hand). They get to die without anyone getting mad at them for doing it theirselves. I don't want to hurt anyone. But I need to go. I believe in an afterlife and it will be more beautiful than I can imagine. Only a few moments of discomfort and then peace. Finally. "
dying dying dying,i�۪m dying. i am so scared. i am too young.
"Dug myself into a hole and can't find my way out again, thinking it may be time","I'm in my late 30s, a two time felon on probation that is a guaranteed 10 years if I screw it up,  with a massive cocaine addiction and no money left. I'm about to lose both my jobs and have everything come to light. I refuse to go back to prison. My options are either to make a run for it or end it. I don't want to die and I don't have the money to make a run for it. I don't know what to do."
Teardrops of eternity,"Distilled, falls slowlyWaterfall of sadness How many lifetimes
. . . ;"
"Having a panic attack, just trying to make it to morning.","Can someone talk with me? Waiting for 6 or so hours until I can see family, I'm going to ask for real help - I know it's getting to the point that I really need it - 14 story fall is looking really good right now but I'm just trying to hold out till morning. Can someone talk with me, keep me company? Trying to deep breathe, but hearing my own breath, or voice talking myself down, or meditation or Netflix etc, nothing is helping. I just don't want to feel so alone right now, but I feel like my soul is being sucked from me, and literally crushed, I literally feel like my soul exists and it is being crushed to death, and I just need a friend or something, anything, just want to stop feeling like my existence is just plain and suffering and that I can't escape the hell hole that is my mind and my own thoughts. Please, can someone chat with me?"
I don't know how much more I can take and I have a plan to commit suicide,"I simply am tired of suffering from this depression, having to pop pills everyday all the time to try and be ""normal"". I hate suffering everyday, waking up and having nothing and feeling nothing. I hate this apathy that plagues me most of the time and makes me so detached from others, unable to care about even the closest people I love when they die. Unable to shed a tear or feel anything.I'm just so tired of living.I see no reason to continue on. I've been in and out of the hospital and even tied the Intensive Outpatient (which was abysmal) and was even told I should consider a more long term residential home that could last 6 months to 2 years.My plan is to finish this last school year, since I agreed to be the Editor in Chief for the college paper, and then I'll probably fly to Japan where I'll venture into Aokigahara forest to end end myself in peace. I just see no reason to live and feel no desire or motivation anymore and I feel like everyone telling me I should live, or that I ""have so much going"" for me and all are just holding me hostage to suffer simply because they don't want to be sad. And worse, I feel like I can't keep my plan, that every night I think about just ending it there. And I feel that way now. "
Fentanyl,I'm going to kill myself tonight.  I heard it's painless and feels good and then I won't be in pain anymore.
How do I help my friend?,"Sorry if this is long.So, during lunch break at school today, I saw my friend, and I went up to him to say hi.  He didn't say hi back and I asked what was wrong.  He straight up said to me that he was depressed and wanted to commit suicide.  So we walked around the school during break.  I found out that his father died when he was young.  He was also abused by his mother ever since he was 3 years old.  He told me that his mother said that she didn't love him.  You can even see the scars on his body from the beatings he got from his mother; his brother is a witness.  People never believed him when he said he was abused and depressed, which caused it to get worse.  He said he is to the point where he doesn't think there's no hope.  He doesn't believe in God.  The air force was the place he wanted to go to because it would be a quick death.  His older brother died in the army.  He tells me that everyday, he holds a gun to his head and thinking about pulling the trigger.  He has a quick temper and has done some bad things in the past.  No one understands him and all the younger kids thinks he's cool because of the things he does.  If someone pulled a gun on him, he wouldn't flinch.  He said that, on his 18th birthday, that he was going to shoot himself in front of his mother.  I just don't know what to do.  He's went through many counselings and he tells me that it just feels like they don't help and they're only there for the money.  Can someone give me any advice on how to help him?  I really don't want to read ""High School Student commits suicide in front of mother"" in the news, knowing that I could have done something about it."
i am at the point of giving up because people and their crab mentality and being empty in a psychological and mental sense for quite this long is unhealthy.,"i have already been empty on the inside for a long time now, still a miracle that i have lasted for this long, parents who were the source of my problems asked me once more what i wanted to do in life and thinking that they have changed told them that i wanted to go back to living a normal life now and asked them on their part to keep their word of not interfering because the damages that they had done have been alot and some are beyond repairable
like the previous times i had asked them but they broke their word.   and i overheard them talking to each other secretly saying that for my brothers to live and to be pulled out of the rut that they made themselves, my future should be sacrificed completely.
i have never been this quite confused and perplexed already knew what i wanted in life but people keep on pulling me down and telling me that its just a phase of mine and continue to say awful things about me towards people and such awful things happened years ago.   "
I can't bear the pain anymore.,"i just want the pain to stop. i want to kill myself so bad. i can't see a future for myself. i'm 16 and life isn't worth it anymore. i can't see what's ahead of me. i only see darkness. everyday, i wake up and it's the same. it's the same pain. i wish i was smart. i wish i was pretty. i wish i was enough for myself to want to stay. i wish i could die. it's not like anything good will ever happen to me. i just want to feel happy. tomorrow, i'll hope it's going to better but then it won't be. it's this endless cycle. i want it to get better, i really do. but my life just keeps falling apart. i haven't been happy for more than 5 minutes. i haven't feel content in forever. what's triggering me right now, it's with school; mostly AP chemistry and and this guy. i feel like he's leading me on. i know he has no interest in me. why do i keep trying? i know he's going to cancel on me next weekend. it would be a miracle, if he didn't. i try so hard in AP chemistry too, and i still don't get an A. I get a fucking 81% B overall and a C on the tests. I got an A in honors chemistry last year but my teacher made a mistake recommending me. and believe me, I try. I'm sick of trying everything in life. I just give up. These aren't the only two things that make me want to die more now than usual. I'm ugly. I'm stupid. I have no talent. I want to be a doctor, but that's just a bust. Sure if you see my transcript, it's a 3.9 unweighted but I don't even want to say what I got on the PSAT. Who knows what I'll get on the SAT or ACT? I'm not gonna get accepted to a good college. Not even med school. I'm going to be homeless in the future. No one likes me. No one loves me. I don't think any of my ""friends"" or ""family"" would really care if I was gone. All I do is burden everyone. I can't remember the last time I told someone good news. I have never had a period in my life where I was happy. I have never had that moment where I've ""gotten better"". the universe hates me. God hates me. everything bad always happens to me. my mom had 2 miscarriages before me. i was probably suppose to be the third. i think this is why the universe keeps throwing shit my way. it's because death is my destiny. i'm meant to kill myself. they say people regret it if they try or they become relieved if they don't. i seriously still have not looked back and thought, ""i'm so glad i didn't kill myself that day."" i think, ""why didn't I kill myself back then?"""
I wish I had the guts to just end it myself.,"But every time I think about doing it, it's just too much to think about it.  I'm not quite at the point where I'll do it, but I don't want to ever be at that point again."
"If I'm gonna die anyway, let it be by my own hand","I used to use throwaways for stuff like this, but fuck it, who gives a shit anymore? I figured that if I'm going to die anyway, I'd rather choose when and how to die instead of rotting away until some force comes to take me away. What with the history of cancer in my family, it's likely that the way I die isn't going to be any less painful than hanging myself or overdosing on my depression meds anyway, and it'll probably take less time so it's a win-win, really. I can't really envision a peaceful natural death for myself to begin with so it's either illness or an accident--or an alternative where I choose my own path.I'm tired of being worried over my health and I'm sick of worrying over everything else. I don't want to stay at work for some bullshit job when a few years down the line I'll be rotting in a coffin anyway. Might as well make it quick. I don't care what I miss--even if I win the lottery tomorrow I won't be taking that money with me when I die. Even if I meet the love of my life tomorrow we're all headed for the shitter at the end of the day. It's time to peace out."
I keep making mistakes and this time it cost me my pets life. I feel guilt I've never felt before.,"Exactly 2 years ago my girlfriend and I got 5 kittens from the street. They were all very sick but we nursed them back to health and found homes for 3 of them.We kept 2 of them and they became inseparable along with my girlfriend's cat. Dexter was bigger than the other cats since little and therefore no one wanted him. But he grew up to be the sweetest cat I've ever had.He was 15 lbs and never ever scratched us. He would always sleep next to my girlfriend and was just an overall sweet gentle big cat.The thing is, he would sometimes breathe weirdly and we didn't pay much attention to it. 4 days ago he became very ill and we took him to the vet right away. Apparently there was some sort of weird bacteria growing close to his lungs and heart.Now I don't think this is what killed him, both my girlfriend and I think he was too stressed and the vet didn't wait long enough for him to calm down before putting a syringe in him to take the liquid out. In the end he died right on my hands even though they had told us less than 5 mins prior that he would be okay to be taken to a 24 Hour emergency vet. He died of stress in my hands and I can't get the image out.I can't help but feel like I failed an innocent creature whose life depended on me. I lost one of my best friend's in a car accident in which I was driving in 2011 (guy crashed into us) and this brings back memories. I can't help but feel like I keep messing up at life. That little cat was a beautiful creature and I know this might all sound dramatic to some of you.But I just feel like such a failure."
"Want to die, cannot feel happiness, so jealous of the dead, AND NO ONE CARES","""Why don't you just get help?""I HAVE ASKED. Thousands upon thousands of times. Family, friends. Asked them all. Shrugs and crickets. ""Call me if you ever need to talk"" and when I do, ""I'm uh... sort of busy now."" Every time.No job, no social life, no life at all. I am in so much pain. My heart hurts. No, it LITERALLY hurts. It feels like The Rock has it in a headlock. It hurts so much that I can't move. And you want me to exercise? Seriously? ""You look so good, what did you do?"" What did I do? I've stopped eating, that's what I've done. You seriously think a 32 year old man looks good at 120 pounds? Why does it take so long to die from starvation??? I'm taking in like 200 calories a day and I'm still alive. WHY?No one cares. They KNOW I've been diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and yet THEY get pissed off when I don't play along. I just want to die. No, Granny, I don't have a girlfriend. I'm gay, but since you're such a braindead homophobe, you haven't noticed. No, Dad, I'm not getting a car. I have no job. What am I going to buy a car with? I've driven with you before and we almost DIED. No, you don't remember because you were DRUNK. And Mom? LOL I literally do not know who my mother is.Report my ass to someone. Fuck it. I'm so done with this. Let me die. I don't want any of this. If God exist, I hope I see him when I die so I can spit in his face."
"Why is Suicide ""not okay""","I want to die. A lot. I have been suicidal since I was seven, and have had a few attempts since I was 18. People always tell me ""it gets better"".... but that's such b.s. It hasn't. It won't.
Why isn't it ""okay"" for people to kill themselves? Whether it be from religious groups or ""caring"" people... why is it not okay? If a person is miserable and in pain every day of their life, constantly wanting to die even when they're ""happy"", wouldn't it be cruel to pressure them into staying alive or saving them after they attempt suicide?
Only once did I feel grateful for surviving my most dangerous suicide attempt (drug induced heart attack)... that feeling lasted for two days before I began wishing i was dead again.
""Dying prevents things from getting better""... oh yea? well dying also prevents things from getting worse. I dont' want to risk staying alive for me just to feel worse.
I hate being alive. I hate being here. I Just want to die. I want to kill myself, but I'm scared I'll fuck up again cuz peope will ""save me""... and then my family and I wil have to face the bills of being saved.
I've been on this planet for 25 years, and 18 of it has been me wanting to die. Things wont' get better, I'll never be normal or content or happy without these stupid thoughts in my head.
I've ""seen help"" and I've been pushed away for being too severe of a case. I've been on meds, but then my insurance stopped covering the ones that work for me. I don't care that I have friends or a boyfriend; I'm just going to lose them eventually anyway."
I did a terrible thing today.,"Now my fianc̩ is going to leave me and I'll be alone. My future is fucked, my life is in shambles, and I just want it all to be over. Why is it that once I get up the courage to finally do this, people come at me saying they love me and they need me? "
Starting to feel suicidal..,"Hello everyone. Long post. I'll try to hit up a TLDR at the end.Don't know how to approach this. I did have a very dramatic and depressive phase back when I was about 17 all throughout 20 or so. I was in a relationship that was extremely emotionally taxing. I'm an emotional guy, fell in love with someone and wanted to marry said person. Like any teenager would say, probably. I attempted suicide once by swallowing a bunch of pills. Not one second after I did that, I started feeling regret and forced myself to throw up all of it. That was then.That relationship ended. I started another one some time later, during my mid 20s (girl was in her late teens). Relationship was perfect for me. She was the prefect girl We had a falling out about a year and half into our relationship. I broke up with her because of the fact that I was under a lot of emotional stress and she wasn't there on a very specific event (regarding someone's death) because we had had a silly fight before. Bad decision on my behalf, I know. During those months apart, I hooked up with some chick. Nothing serious and we didn't have sex, only fooled around.Two months after our breakup, she called me, we started seeing each other again. I told her there was someone I was seeing during that time, but that was that. We got back together after a month and a half of seeing one another again. For the past 2+ years, things were really nice. She was a tad bit colder lately, but she's been taking medication (doctors warned us that the medicine would affect her behaviour) and just finished college and got a job that is very time demanding. I understood that.Out of the blue, she called me and broke up with me not too long ago. She said she doesn't feel the same way and hasn't been able to overcome what happened two years ago. She's a really honest person, she's not your average girl. She's very old-school too. Before me, she hadn't even kissed anyone. And during the almost 4 year long relationship, she didn't want to have sex as she wanted to save herself for marriage (which I understood).This broke my heart. I love her and even planned on proposing this very month. But that's not the only thing. I have had decently-paying jobs, achieved several stuff at work and gained recognition amongst the high end personnel. That said I hated every single job and quit a couple of months ago to do some soulsearching.I spent two months depressed. Not because I didn't have a job, but because I can't find what is it that I want to do. I had no motivation. I told her I felt down all the time, except when I was around her.  Income is not an issue, I have a substancially large amount of savings in the bank - if I were to live off barely minimums, I could probably sustain myself for 3 or 4 years before having to work again. Money is not the issue.I just feel I have nothing left. I asked her to reconsider, to spend a week together thinking about stuff before making a decision. She said she didn't know if that was a good idea and said she'd think about it but decided to ""stay bf and gf"" until the decision was made. That was Wednesday afternoon. We agreed we wouldn't talk to one another until she decided, to give her time to think. She hasn't answered so far.This is killing me. I feel like the only thing that is keeping me here is the fact that there's a 0.1% chance she'll decide not to break up. I feel pathetic, never did I thought I'd be so emotionally dependant on someone but I feel like I have nothing else. The one thing I loved and was sure of is leaving me. I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be dead. If I knew about a 100% efficient method, that was quick and painless... trust me, I'd be making the necessary preparations.TLDR: Professional Crisis depression coupled with long-time girlfriend (who I was gonna propose to this month) leaving me for a fight we had 2 years ago has lead me to contemplate suicide. I feel like killing myself even though I'm not financially or socially estranged. Haven't felt this way since I was a teenager almost 10 years go. Worst sensation I've experienced in my life."
I just spent the last few hours trying to get ahold of multiple 24/7 suicide prevention chats...,"Nobody was available, this made me realize multiple things; some logical and some not. Two being, If they are that busy then I am really not alone in this and two that, theres no hope or help for me. Is someone willing to talk to me right now? Please. "
I don't get the point of life,I'm going to start this post by saying that I'm really high and sad and this will probably be a ramble and not formatted well as I'm on mobile. I'm 18 with nothing but a handful of cheap clothes and 1 set of already too old contacts for my vision. I still have another 2 weeks before my first paycheck and another month before my first big one. My only place to live is with my girlfriend. And she knows that so she treats me like shit knowing I can't leave. I treat her like a princess to not get kicked out yet I still get accused and yelled at for always ruining our relationship. Everytime we have sex I'm always doing things for her and we have days were I don't cum while I put in the time to satisfy her in multiple ways. She doesn't trust me and always thinks I'm cheating or I'm going to cheat just because I use to mess around a lot before we got together. I'm honestly at the point where I want to break up with her but I can't handle the consequences. I havent been this depressed in a while. I'm more depressed now than my last suicide attempt. Yet somehow I havent genuinely considered it. It's just that it's hard for me to see a future for myself. I always fuck up my own life. I fuck it up and I'm okay with it. I do things I know are going to make my life harder and I tell myself it's what I want. Just to please someone else. I'm so nice to everyone in hopes that good karma will come back. I always said one more year one more year. And that karma will come back. Yet no one has ever showed me the love that I give to every single person in my life. How do you meet new people? Where do you find chill ass people. I dont know why I'm even writing this I guess I just need people to talk to idk
Everyday when I wake up my first thought is how much I want to blow my head open with a shotgun,"I have no friends. I haven't had a girlfriend in over a year. I feel like a ghost floating around the world, unable to make contact with anyone. Sometimes I fantasize about blowing my head off in class or other public places where it would be forever burned into strangers memories. Does anyone else understand this feeling?"
All my friends are in a shitty place and I can't help,"Two of my only good friends are really depressed, cutting themselves, etc, and I'm horribly socially awkward (as well as mildly depressed), even over text, and feel completely useless when it comes to supporting them or encouraging them. I guess this isn't exactly the right sub or whatever, but I don't want to bother doing the research to find the right one. I jut don't know what to do."
Anxiety is Going to Kill Me,"Hello -I haven't posted on here before but I'm driven to get a few things off my chest before I go crazy. I'm having another anxiety attack. I am basically in a constant anxious state, There is not a day that goes by that I'm not struggling with 'what if this happens' or 'what if the worst happens down the road'. I can't take this anymore.My chest hurts as I write this, I am on the brink of crying again (which I did a few hours ago - for about a half an hour/45 mins). I can't 'live in the moment' like everyone tells me to. I tell myself over and over again there's nothing to worry about right now. Everything is fine within this moment. Which is counseling I've given people before (yes. I used to be a counselor). I've saved at least one life in the 5 1/2 years I worked in the field (suicide prevention/substance abuse). But evidently I can't help myself.I just want to sleep, but I can't. I just want to stay home from work, but I can't. I just want to go hiking on the trails near my apartment, but I can't. I just want to draw, but I can't. Nothing is making me happy, everything is just dragging me right back into anxiety again. It's never been this bad before. I just want to sleep, relax, and be worry-free. I can't. I don't know what to do."
Give me one reason.,No one gives a shit anymore. I'vve done this so many times. The meds don't work and they never will. I've just been lying to myself all along.Give me one good reason to stay alive. My mind is racing and I can't think of anything I anc't do this anymore
I wish I could just die,why?
Been depressed for so long,"As the title says.. i've been depressed for so long... lost the love of my life.. in danger of losing my job, i've always thought of suicide of a option of an easy way out... but now i see it as my only route.. i lost all my real life friends. everything i try to do doesn't make me happy anymore.. losing all my emotions, i can't even fake smile in front of everyone anymore, i ended up talking to someone on snapchat... seeing if i could cheer up.. then today.. i ended up having a dream of me killing myself... i don't know what's holding me back anymore... i tried my best seeking help...  but instead of asking for help.. i only end up saying the words they hate.. i know i'm a despicable human.. thanks for whoever is reading this... i was planning to  just end it on my birthday which is october 21st... so i'm trying to find things that make me happy again.. "
I'm about to take all the lithium I have,"I am right on the edge. Everything in my life has changed this year, and I simply opt not to deal with it anymore. It's all too much. I have a whole lot of lithium and it's a drug that gets toxic very quickly above a therapeutic dose. I'm ready to go."
my crippling fear of the dark is a burden,"having a fear of the dark is ""childish"" because ""only children are scared of the dark"". but i am sick and tired. ive always had a fear of the dark, as a child it was VERY bad but as i got older it settled down a bit but i couldnt be in a dark room without freaking out, but i could sleep in one. but not so recently the fear has come back and its worse. as a child i would keep the door open but now i sleep with all my lights on. i always feel like im being watched; being followed. ive never been stalked in my life, so its not related to a traumatic past. i always look behind me or see things in the light or dark that i think is going to kill me. it is unberable. i cannot live like this, i cannot live cooped up in my house with all the lights on 24/7. i also live with my parents because i simply cannot be left alone otherwise id have a major panic attack. but my parents call me childish,stupid and say ""dont be an idiot"". it hurts. i cannot live normally like this and they wont even help me. its driving me insane. i just want to die to end it all. just imagine having something always in the corner of your eye, taunting you. if i dont kill myself whatever is following me is. i dont believe in ghosts but i no longer sleep, i just stay up with my lights on. i cant do it anymore, i just cant. no one takes me seriously. when i told my friend she just laughed at me, realised i was being serious but still wasnt 100% genuine. all i think is ending mine or someone elses life. i need helo but id rather just die. i dont think what im going to do tomorrow, i just think if id finally have the balls to kill myself."
I think it's time to finally leave on my own terms,"I've come here to put into words the things that have been in my mind for as long as I can remember, I feel selfish saying these things, all throughout my life the only one true friend I have had is my horse through my school years and through college I only have had my horse who knew all my secrets and everything about me, ever since he died 7 years ago I felt a part of me has died along with him and since then all I've done is exist, I've not felt true happiness in this time ever again and the only reason I haven't ended it yet is that I feel guilty for who I leave behind I feel my life has no value whatsoever and that my presence would not be missed. Every night I go to sleep I pray that I don't wake up but unfortunately I'm still here. It is sad I know but the only two things that have kept me going are my current horse and Taylor swifts music but even then I feel an overwhelming hollow in my life and would sooner it be over"
Not really sure where to go from here,"Not really sure why I'm posting, maybe just to vent? Anyway I've been struggling for years now but always managed to keep my head just above water until recently.
Earlier this year I lost a close friend to suicide and my first reaction was envy that he was able to go through with it when I never was.
I went a bit off the rails after that, lost my job, my drinking got out of control, cheated on my boyfriend while black out drunk and eventually ended our 9 year relationship because he said he couldn't drown with me anymore.
I had to move back in with my family which was never going to be the best for my mental health, 3 people with bipolar under one roof... ANYWAY the downward spiral continued and last night I got scared because I was ready to finally kill myself, I wrote out the note and planned it all out but in a brief moment of clarity I decided to go to the hospital and try and get help one last time.
They weren't particularly helpful, I guess because I hadn't actually made an attempt so they sent me home but not before calling my mum and discussing things I assumed I had told them in confidence.
Anyway my mum said she couldn't handle it and left and didn't come home all night and all day today.
When I got out of bed today a family friend was waiting for me saying that mum couldn't handle an adult child who needed her so much and that I wasn't able to live with her moving forward, the family friend offered to take me in if I couldn't find anywhere else to go.
I was at a bit of a loss because I really don't want to live with this family friend, it's not the healthiest environment and it's quite far away from where I'm living now but I have nowhere else to go.
I called my ex for some perspective because we still have a good friendship but his reaction was to lash out at my mum for not looking after me.
I'm so sick of feeling like everyone's burden, I've alienated all of my friends, they're amazing people and trying so hard to keep up with me but they just don't understand mental illness and get frustrated that I keep repeating self destructive behaviours so one by one they're dropping off. My friends can't do it anymore, my ex can't do it anymore and now my mum can't do it anymore either, finding it pretty hard to find reasons not to just end it now.
I used to justify to myself that if I killed myself it would be too painful for my family and friends and that's what always stopped me but now I think it wouldn't be so bad to free them all of me."
Just thoughts..,"I think ive come to my final decision. As much as i want to kill myself, believe me i do. As much as i want to join you and be with her for all of eternity. As much as I 100% want to die, kill myself and forever spend eternity with you. I can't. I can't knowingly put my family, my friends, the people that would be effected by my suicide. I can't knowingly put them through the tsunamis of pain, the mental earthquakes that has shaken me to the core, that has destroyed the pillars of support that held me together.The ones that your decision sent my way. The ones that cause me to be completely and utterly terrified of waking up in the morning because I know I have to spend another day knowing she isn't here on this earth. Knowing that she isn't alive anymore. That she is dead. The ones that cause me to stop breathing for moments on end. The ones that cause my mind to go numb, the endless waterfall of tears and the darkness that envelopes my mind�� when I think about your death. Your suicide. The decision that has led my life to spiral since your death, the one that have led me to coming to the brink of taking my own life as well in hopes of joining you. In hopes of being with you again. I will forever spend my life wishing i had taken my life during the times i could have. Wishing that i had made that step when i had the choice. No matter how wrong i thought your choice was. No matter how much I know I could have given you the help you needed. No matter how much i resent your decision for not only not telling me about this decision but also for following through with it. Yet I could never resent you. I could never resent the loving, caring, loyal and beautiful soul that was wrongfully blanketed in darkness. The one that hated herself and felt that she was only living for the sake of others. The one that couldn't see the beauty and perfection of which I saw. The kindness and goodness of your heart that your clouded eyes could not see. I can only say I am truly happy that you are not living this life you hate, the life which others corrupted and destroyed, the life you never deserved but was forcefully given it. The one that caused you astronomical amounts of pain and misery to the point where you could not see an escape. I am glad you don't have to suffer anymore. Because I love you, because i love you more than words could even express. So i have decided i will harbour your pain. I will spend hours trying to fall asleep but eventually waking up in the early hours of the day crushed by your absence. I will spend every waking moment in sadness in despair, grieving over your loss. I will spend every time I wake up fucking exhausted and cowering in fear that I am not living a nightmare but a reality without you in it. I will spend my life in hopes forever in love with you. Forever wishing you told me. Forever wishing I had been able to save you. Forever forcing myself to march on no matter how much i want to join you. I will wake up everyday in hopes that I will die today. In hopes that I will finally join you. I am not saying that your decision is selfish. Because it's not. You were in so much pain and misery that you couldn't stand it anymore. However knowing the effects that a decision like yours can cause, I cannot do it. It will never be goodbye, just a see you soon. Just a brief break. Till we meet again. Forever yours. Forever my love. N.C. "
i can't,"going in and out of a suicide ward every other week is not a life worth living, nothing ever changes, nothing makes me smile, nothing matters to me anymore. i wanted helping people to make it worth it all,but is cant even help myself, i'm in a room with no doors with one wall open to the abyss - to freedom. if i knew this was how i would end up i'm not sure would have lasted beyond 15, i could have been remembered as that girl that loved to run in the forest and helped the old men smoke fish even if they didn't really need any help. but no, i lived on to try to end my life at age 29 and again at 30. i never felt that ""im so glad i didn't die"" that so many failed suicidees talk about. my first conscious thoughts after the second attempt was: ""fuck.. no."" i really don't want to feel like this anymore everyday is worse than the last, the pressure over the chest heavier everyday. i feel i know how this will end and i feel terrible for the people i will fail. the effort to even think and not just stare into the void is almost unbearable, i remember nothing, i find notes i've written myself i have no memory of, nothing feels real. i'm not even sure anyone of you is real, how could i? i'm not real myself.i've tried it all, 6-7 kinds of medication, many therapists and psychiatrists, meditation, exercised my whole life, and on and on and on...i know another person i still actually care about would do the same if i did this and that hurts a fucking lot, but i just can't stand this anymore. i have nothing more to give.."
I can't take it.,I can't take it anymore. I'm a 17 year old fucking retard with no friends or loved ones. All I do is sit on my ass the whole day playing video games. I can't take it I need real friends. I need something someone. I can't do this whole internet friend bullshit anymore. I need someone to hold me. Someone who I can touch. I need something. I can't take it anymore
What do you guys do when depressed?,What do you guys do to distract yourselves when extremely depressed?
don't know what to do anymore,"well my mom is terrible, she's moody and don't give a fuck about anything but her bf. i have younger sister, she's 9 and she has everything she wants, i know she's little and it's ok. well not really, my mother is divorced with father of my sis (he's alcoholic) and they give my sister everything because the don't want to be the ""worse"" parent....
but that's not really what i wanted to talk about.
my mother don't believe that depression is something important, i've bee dealing with it for quite long time but she always says that i only make it up for attention.
this would be kinda ok but there's this: i don't drink alcohol, smoke nor take drugs. i have normal grades in school and i don't really go out (no friends). so pretty good child right? not for my mother, she will find every little thing that i did or didn't do and will scream at me, hit me in the face and stuff like this.
i have a bf ( we are together more than year) and she likes to talk really bad about him in front of me, i totally adore this boy and she knows it...
it may seem like it's nothing but it's just too much for me. keep in mind i'm not 18 yet :)
i thought about suicide a lot lately but i don't want to hurt my bf... i don't give a fuck about my mother anymore. i can say i pretty much hate her.
EDIT: my bf said he doesn't want to have anything to do with her anymore...
same here boy... same here"
I feel like being such an ignorant.,"I have no idea what to expect of this post, but I seriously just want to post this and sort of get it out of my head. I've been thinking of suiciding for some time now, and it has really gotten worse to be honest. When I am all alone and walk around in the kitchen I often catch myself imagining me just taking whatever tool and ending it, just like that. And ofc. I've tried to find the easiest and least painful way to do it, I just cant. I cant stand the thought of ruining my family's lives, just because I dont feel happy at all. Most of the time I'd rather feel like living a hell, but there are moments in which I just feel like snapping, and go ignorant; ending it.
There is absolutely no doubt that, if I didnt have a family or any friends, I would end it all. I seriously dont want to talk about this to anyone I know, or generally anyone in person, I dont want to be treated differently because of it. I have been thinking about calling a suicideline but I find it so odd to call them up and be like: ""Hi I feel like commiting suicide"". The only reason I post this here, is because you cant see me or judge me. I can just hide behind this screen.  "
I don't know for much longer i can keep this up,I feel like i'm going crazy.. and the temptations are growing stronger. I'm just so sorry...
"Did something greedy, immoral, selfish","I was attempting to restore a wooded area overgrown with invasives. I cleared the invasive species, and a forester came in and told me to girdle (kill without cutting down) ""undesirable"" trees. I blindly listened and did it. Now I see the dead trees and I feel like an awful human being. I did plant thousands of tree seedlings in their place (over 5,000), but heavy summer rain, weeds, and deer have wiped many of them out. What eats at me is the fantastic, foolish greed that would drive one to remove native ""undesirable"" healthy trees in place of ""better trees"" in the woods. How could I have listened to this advice? Two of these ""undesirable"" trees were 50+ years old. Many were 15 - 30 years old. Now I find myself stuck in a toxic cycle of rumination, doubt, anxiety, and self critique. Some of the dead trees are in view of the neighbors, and I'm fearful that they know what I did. I also feel tremendous guilt for affecting their view of the woods. I have been working to clean these dead trees up and split them for fire wood. I have hand split 6 truckloads thus far..."
Guys I think it's time,I just wanna be gone bye Reddit
Panicking over spilling gas on street.,"God, I'm not thinking anything through in my life now. I filled my lawnmower with Gas-Oil mix instead of Oil, and waaaaay too much. That particular lawnmower isn't working right now, and I've been using another to cover up the damage. I was about to use carburetor cleaner to repair it, but realized I had a ton of it left in the system. Like a FUCKING IDIOT, I emptied it out (Less than a gallon) onto the street, right next to our house in fact. Now I'm panicing, literally, that my parents will notice it, and that it is a pernament stain on our block. I don't know what to fuking do, because I suspect it can't be removed, but this is making me very, very worried."
I FINALLY figured it out.,"I think I've been ready to die for a very, very long time. I can remember a time, back when I was 12 years old, and I was watching ""The 4400"" with my mom and older brother. There was this episode (I'm sorry I can't be more specific, it was a decade back) where people had created a ���shot�۪ that could be given to ���normals�۪ ��� and they had exactly a 50/50 shot if either getting superpowers, or dropping dead. Both my mother and brother debated while the credits rolled, each determining that, even for the chance at getting some amazing powers, they wouldn�۪t want to risk losing their lives. I said something along the lines of ���But it�۪s a win wither way! You can either join the 4400, or you don�۪t have to live anymore.�۝  . . . I still remember the looks on their faces. I think it was the first time I started to think of myself as a freak.I�۪m 23 years old. And I fucking hate myself. I think all people are inherently valuable from that which they bring into the world and people around them. How does one measure a person? By their impact. And for as long as I can remember, i have found myself lacking. I am truly ugly, a round face and dank hair and a potato of a body that trips and stumbles and brushes into other people without their consent or desire. I�۪m weak, emotionally and physically ��� couldn�۪t fight to save my life, and wouldn�۪t have the strength of mind to do it anyhow. I�۪m manipulative ��� so many people look at me and think that I am a good, sweet thing that only smiles and offers lame jokes and loves life, when in fact I detest living with every particle of my being, and am able to fool everyone I know just by acting like anything matters to me, when I am in fact growing more and more certain that nothin, nothing, NOTHING does at all. I�۪ve always unerringly thought myself a fine actress ��� and the fact that no one around me known enough of my turmoil to think that my jokes about ���can�۪t wait to die�۪ might just be real really proves it. I�۪m stupid, and in a field where I will never bring discernible contribution to the world around me, other than serving people who, like myself, don�۪t give a shit about me. I�۪m sick and twisted and lost in memories and half-fucking-crazy; I am a liar and a thief and some diet-form of a sociopath. I�۪m Grayson, and I hate myself. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, killing myself wouldn�۪t be the best idea. I tried telling myself all of the usual things; my job will need me, my family will be devastated, my friends will miss me, there are so many things to look forward to, it gets better . . . white noise in my ears, anymore. My job doesn�۪t need me. I love what I do, and once imagined myself doing it forever . . . But let�۪s face it, it doesn�۪t take a genius to check people into a hotel, or manage budgets, or plan parties. I see coworkers getting promoted all around me, with less experience and less time in the industry and less (or no) education, and it just reinforces to me, over and over and over again, that I�۪�۪m not really hot shit at my job; I�۪m not going to do anything amazing, or make waves . . . I�۪ll just be in my entry-level position for another three years, working my ass off and still just not being good enough ��� because desire and ambition don�۪t make it in this world ��� connections and talent do. Neither of which I have. I am at the point where I have managed to convince myself that my family would understand why I did whatever it is I am going to do; my father was once suicidal, and he survived by the skin of his teeth . . . and made a change for the better in his life. And then he had my siblings, and spawned me into this world. I was never a very good daughter, the kind that my mother wanted and needed . . . but my little sister is there to help her through any loss she might feel in my death . . . And god, my little sister; she�۪s perfect, beautiful and smart and kind and funny and hard-working . . . She�۪s going places, and we all take pride in her every move; I like to think that she would be understanding about what happened, maybe a little sad, but knowing that I am worth more to a world I am not in than one I am consistently fucking up. My older brother doesn�۪t even know me anymore, hasn�۪t been interested in me for a long, long time. My little brother . . . well, we love eachother, but he�۪s a very sensible person, logical almost to a fault; he can understand that there is no point in living if you�۪re not going to do anything worthwhile with the gift you�۪ve been given. Truthfully, I think that the only ones I have any doubts about are my niece and nephew ��� I love the hell out of them; but they are so very young, sweet and impressionable and innocent . . . When I�۪m gone, it�۪ll only take a few years before they forget Auntie Grayson, and it will be better that way. Life is always better without me. I have three best friends in the world. One of them uses me, clearly and obviously, because I gratify her need for attention. I�۪d be of better use to her dead, because then she can revel in being the mourning friend of that dead girl. My second best friend is a strong woman, married and independent and tough as nails; she was fine before I came into her life, and she�۪ll be fine long after I�۪m gone. My last best friend, my oldest and most important . . . Well, about a year ago, she booted me our of her life, and told me she was better with me gone ��� and really, she was . . . the minute I was gone, she found a better job, managed to get engaged, and bought a house. We�۪re friends again, now, had a weepy reunion and all that bullshit, but there�۪s a hollowness there that was never acknowledged before. I mean, she clearly excelled when I was driven from her life; me ducking out now can only help her further. I am a bad person. I am toxic and shallow and wrong. I wish, sometimes, that someone would come and just beat the shit out of me so I could feel as if, maybe, just a little bit, I am making headway on the punishment I need . . . but I�۪ve been (un)lucky enough to avoid anything akin to that.I�۪ve started to realize that life doesn�۪t get better. I am 23 years old, have a good job and a boyfriend of more than a year that I love, I am almost done with schooling . . . And I feel nothing. I Google ���is it okay to want to die�۝ and ���why is my presence a blight upon this world.�۝ I drink sometimes, and it helps me sleep; I take burning hot showers because the tingles on my skin make me feel like someone is toughing me, like maybe I am being held, and sub sequentially held back . . . But nothing. I keep trying to rationalize my existence, I believe that everything happens for a reason . . . And I have done SOME good in my life, a drop in the bucket . . . but there�۪s really nothing more I can contribute to anyone, and I feel like my death is the next step. What is the point in hanging around if my purpose has been fulfilled? And, more to the point, my life ending would benefit the people I care about a good great deal; my family and friends would receive the benefit of my years of savings and frugality, my brother would have a completely paid-for apartment for another year, and all of my clothes and things could go to people who would actually appreciate them, to people who need them and want them and care. Some people, I think, just aren�۪t meant to be alive. Some of us are mistakes ��� and we need to correct mistakes. I think I�۪ve made up my mind to kill myself. It is not because I�۪ve had a bad life, or because anyone pushed me into it. For once, this is something I�۪m doing all on my own, and for once, it is something good. I feel so at peace, knowing that I finally made a choice. I don�۪t know when or how (though I imagine soon, and I hope with a gun). I�۪ve had a living will and a life insurance policy for some time, and all I really need to do is decide whether or not to leave a note. I don�۪t think I will. I don�۪t want people to remember me. I�۪m not sharing this to get advice or people telling me not to do it. I just wanted to be honest, just this one time, and tell someone what I am really thinking, what I am really feeling. And God, do I feel light. . . .Thank you for your time. Better luck next time. "
Please help me I can't take this anymore it's gotten way worse than ever.,"After my recent failed suicide attempt I can't do it anymore it's as if my body won't even let me die. It's torturing me every moment of my life is spent thinking about ending this torment. Take my body, take anything from me just please help me run away from that country or please I wish I was dead I don't know how to do this anymore. It's hopeless  "
I don't know who I am any more.,"I remember when I was younger, I used to be happy and have fun. I don't know what happened to the old me, but here I am. No friends or social life. I have no talents or hope of a career. I don't know who I am any more."

Loneliness,"I've struggled with depression and loneliness my whole life. I've been estranged from family members since I moved from the east coast to CA at age 17. Currently I do not have any close friends. I have not felt interested in dating or able to trust anyone on that level in well over a year. Fundamentally I feel the problem is with myself and that I am unlovable, unworthy, and incapable of sustaining relationships. I've tried many strategies and therapies over the years but none has provided sufficient change or relief.Currently I'm on a one-week vacation from work and I do not look forward to returning. I'm a Registered Nurse and although it feels good at times when I'm able to do something well and/or be helpful to my patients, there are various factors which make it not feel worthwhile. The most significant is that I don't fit in with coworkers and it's hard to remain pleasant and friendly while I am painfully aware that I'm excluded from the clique. Another factor is that I work for a large hospital corporation whose primary goal is to extract as much labor as possible, resulting at times in unsafe patient loads. I don't really blame them for this, but it can take a toll on my motivation and energy level. Overall, what really takes a toll when providing care for people who are extremely sick is that I don't have anyone who cares for me, to help me replenish myself. My mind and body are not as sharp to respond quickly to life-threatening emergencies when depression and loneliness eat away at me on a daily basis. I've been making plans to move back to the area where I went to college as it is the only place I've felt any degree of acceptance, friendship, and love. I'm here at the moment but feel discouraged and lonelier than ever. Property values which have always been high have doubled and tripled in the 3 years I've been away. The properties I arranged go-sees for are horrible irl and have many hidden fees. I lost touch with the friends I had, or they have moved elsewhere.What feels like the final straw in this bundle of loneliness is that my dog whom I adore and has never left my side since I adopted him last winter now just ignores me since I've been here, and prefers the person I'm staying with. He used to seek me out for attention and cuddles and in those moments I was truly happy. It feels unbearable to lose that too. I have other, more fundamental issues and fears that are too primal and vulnerable to put in writing on a public forum so I've stuck to these more basic, superficial, and describable grievances. I'm not seeking advice by posting here, nor do I hold much hope for support or kindness from internet strangers on Reddit, but I do feel calmer having named the most acute sources of my despair and loneliness, and in fact, a tiny bit less lonely, so for that I appreciate this forum and anyone who takes the time to read. Thank you."
What's the point of staying alive?,To suffer 99% of life just for 1% of pleasure.
Insult to injury,"Last week, in a moment of severe pain, I posted on social media about how hard life has been for me lately. A couple of people responded with general messages of support-hang in there, sorry to hear this. One person who responded was a former classmate of mine. She's really nice and we got along well. She asked how she could help and I said that I could use someone to talk to. She said I could message her any time. It was late that night, so I wrote to her the following morning. The conversation was disappointing. I let her know some of the problems I've been having and she just seemed to not be listening. She was like everyone else, just saying hang in there. It hurt. I felt like I was wasting her time. I don't now why she offered to talk to me when she didn't care. We only ended up exchanging a few messages until she dropped out of the conversation. That was last week. Today I reached out to her again to let her know how things were going--I had taken some steps during the week to work on some of the problems that I had. She didn't respond. Later I found out that she had been in the same city as me today. I feel very hurt that she was here and never mentioned it/didn't reach out or make plans when she knows I'm having a hard time and I don't have anyone around me. She's the only person I have to talk to and she doesn't want to talk to me. I know a professional would be better, but I don't have the money for that. And I need someone to talk to in general, not just about mental health things. I don't have any friends. She's the closest thing to it. She is nice and caring, but I just don't matter to her. I don't want to live. This experience is the last disappointment I could take. I know I'm worthless, but this tenuous connection was the only bit of hope I had left. Maybe if I could have had a conversation with somebody, the pain would have alleviated a little. I'll always be alone and I can't deal with that pain anymore. "
I finally have no one to talk to,"I moved out of my hometown about a year ago and getting used to a new lifestyle and making friends has been hard. The worst part is, I had a girlfriend back home whom I had just started to date and I had to explain to her that I'll be back one day and I know it's hard, but we have to try. For a while it wasn't too bad, it's a long distance but I still managed to visit. But these past months have been full of confusion and lack of communication that leads to more and more arguing. We both have depression in our own ways and it affects us differently. We were so good together. I never saw myself with anyone else, and I'm sure she felt the same. But recently, she's taken an whole 180 on me and I don't know who she is anymore. She gets so cold on me and rarely replies to my messages. I tell her that I love her and that I'm always here for her and all I get back is a, ""Thank youuu."" I've never done so much for one person and it's all falling apart and I don't know why. I don't know if she simply doesn't care about me anymore, or if there's someone else involved, I've been suspicious for a while now. This relationship meant everything you me and now it's hanging by a thread despite my desperate attempts to talk about it and fix it. On top of that, I pay my mom's rent, work a job that makes me hate everything, I don't have plans for the future, or much money, I just honestly hate myself. I've never considered suicide until now. But I don't want anyone to know right away. I wish I could just disappear to save me the guilt. I don't have anymore intentions of going on. My only friend was my soon to be ex"
i want to die more than anything,"i don't know why i feel like this every day, i do not deserve to feel like this constantly, i want to die so bad, i hate every single thing about myself, i pray to die every single day and the only time i will ever be truly happy is when i am dead, there is no string of words in the entire english language to express how badly i want to stop existing, i would give everything i have ever owned for someone to kill me"
Why can't I just go back?,"I've posted here before. Sorry for being so needy.I want to go back to around this time last year. Not to change anything, just to be able to be a little bit happy again. I've made progress in transitioning, but I've lost almost everything important to me in the process, and I hate it. If I could have just a tiny bit of joy in my life then, why can't I now that I've made progress in changing my life for the better? It makes no sense.There's so much that I've gained this year. Starting my transition, finding new forms of entertainment, finishing required classes for my major. But if I could just repeat those classes, that time, over and over and over again, I would. The professor was the best person I've ever met, and I made more friends during one semester than I ever made before or since.And now, as soon as those classes were over, they left. Every single one of them. The first people in my life I truly treasured from the bottom of my heart, gone in a flash. I've attempted suicide twice since then, and I wish I succeeded.I know it's nonsense to hope for something good to come out of suicide, but I don't see any other way to be happy. I'm an emotionally unstable wreck with nobody and nothing. If nothing else, maybe it would make people look at me, see me. I wish someone would realize that they cared, but the only people in my life are those who have already forgotten and those who would forget about me within a few months.So what do I do? Do I continue even though I'm dying inside, or do I just get it over with? I've heard ""it gets better"" so many times. Why hasn't anything changed? But it's stupid that I would expect it to after only a few months.What am I doing with my life? I just want attention. It's so shallow. Why should I care? But even if it's abusive attention, it's better than nothing. My family all say they love me, but why don't they reach out? Within 30 minutes of my second suicide attempt, no-one checked up on me or even messaged me. My sister and two of my brothers never said anything at all. My other brother talked for me for a few minutes after I reached out because he wasn't busy at the time. My parents just wanted me to go to the hospital so they could go to the gym instead of ""looking after"" me. What's wrong with me? Why am I so worthless? What did I do? Even as a child, I was literally forgotten until I pestered someone for a few minutes of them ""caring"".What's up with the double standard? Whenever my siblings ""succeed"", they're praised and celebrated. When I do the same or better, I get a ""Oh, well, good job, then."" My mother told me that she had a miscarriage of a female baby between my older brothers (twins) and me. I'm MtF trans.  Why would you tell me that?Because I excelled academically, I graduated high school early. When my brothers were 18, my parents had them start paying rent, since they'd graduated and could move out. I had to start paying at 16. I need that money to transition. I can't afford a lot of the stuff I need anyway.I made all sorts of stupid, outrageous promises just to get people to look at me for a little while. Now I have to keep them. I don't want to, but at least that way someone might look at me, praise me, for a little while.I'm lost. I want to try to OD again. I understand that I'll feel better in the morning. But that just feels fake. I don't want to be fake like that. I'd rather die than deceive myself.Should I stop taking my medications? At least the voices in my head and the people who weren't there would pay attention to me. At least there was somebody who would talk to me. Do I want to lose myself like that? Do I want to risk that I might kill someone without realizing what I'm doing? I don't know. I guess I might as well try it before I kill myself. But I don't want to wait.I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess for some attention again."
I'm just tired.,"Hi. This is maybe my last attempt to reach out. I'm a 17 year old compulsive liar, and I've destroyed my relationship with my boyfriend by lying to him about my age. For the last several months, ive felt so alone. I've started to think about self harming for the first time in years, and i lay in bed crying in the morning very often. My chest always hurts, i can't avoid my anxiety attacks, and i all around just hate this. I don't know if I really want help, i just need a place to dump my feelings i guess. "
"If I don't end up in inpatient soon, I'm going to die.","Title explains it all. I'm ready to die, as that's been what my brain's been telling me, non-stop, even when I'm out doing things I love. My psychiatrist is closed, and so is the doctor's office. I'm fucked. I'm absolutely fucked."
Panics and decisions I can't make.,"Okay. So this is going to get heavy so, proceed with caution. So I have fallen for this girl. Her name is N. N is fantastic and I love spending time with her and we attended the same university and I can see her whenever I want. Her nose is adorable and her heart is super open and she everything good about this world. She makes my heart flutter and I can't really look her in the eyes very much because it make me come appart due to part two. Edit: N does have cats and loves them and that's awesome! But I am extremely allergic to cats. Hives, sneezing, crying. All of it. Part two. I have a girlfriend of two years. Bestfriend. We've been through really shitty situations, and fight kinda often. She attended uni about 45 minutes away so we can only really see each other on weekends. I really do love this girl. But we have both discussed that we feel a constant need to talk to eachother because we can't visit as often and it makes me stay up later than I would like. Her and I can watch movies and fuck and just sit around together and be a couple. I enjoy her presence but it's very rare that I get to. She's not religious so o feel I have to go to church behind her back because she is so anti church. She know I go but it just feel bad when I do. Now comes my final issue. I have gotten it in my head that killing myself would make all of these issues go away. All this pain. I don't want to die I just don't want to hurt. I feel pressure to make a decision but I actually hate the idea of having to break up with someone. I hate loosing N as a friend. But, death seams like a good solution. I don't want to die. I just don't want to have to hurt anymore. I can't make this decision. Please anyone if you can give me some help. "
What do you do when you have no one left?,"You post on Reddit because everybody here cares. Sometimes we don't have anybody we can talk to and we feel like we're alone in our day-to-day life but you really aren't. There's hundreds of thousands of us who really care and want to help, and be there for people like you. Most of us are going through the exact same thing and feel the exact same way- which just makes us understand you more. You are not alone, I promise you. We may feel like we are, but that does not have to defeat us. "
Im struggling - im sorry,"I don't know what to do. I feel so numb I feel so empty I don't know what to do. I don't want to be this miserable anymore.
I've got so many promises with people, I don't want to let people down but I know I will _��_"
Im going to blow my fucking brains out,So much fucking shit. I don't want to hear any bullshit or get linked to some bullshit hotline. Tell me something fucking real
I hear voices in my head telling me to kill myself,"I am a 27 year old male with a rare nueromuscular disease and I have had numerous concussions, which might explain the voices. I don't know what to do or who to talk too, i have no real friends and feel like I'm done with life. "

My mother made me promise her I would never do it, not while she is alive at least, and I'm keeping my promise. But I hate my life right now.I just... Don't know how to fix it. And I don't see the problem fixing itself soon like it usually happens. I don't know what to do since this had never happened.I just need some help going through the worst years of my life.This is too much man..."
Why is life such a BIG DEAL?,"Sorry for the aggressive cap lock in the title guys
I'm kinda new to reddit, I suffer from major depression from six years or so, but even before my life wasn't so good
but let's go straight to the point.I'm sitting in a room, or I'm going out, I must see people, I go home, have panic attacks during all of this, and you know what? I don't give a f.I hope I die when I turn 23 or so
this will make you smile
literally in front of my last birthday cake's candles I wished to die, I saw a falling star some weeks ago and my first thought was make me die you f*** star. And if I think of myself dead, my body still kinda warm but the skin a little bit blue-green from the blood flow stopping, I feel the pain softeningI wish to kill myself in a few months, but I don't know how, If I have to do it, It must be done well, I need something that will not leave me alive and paralized on a chair of the hospital.Other than that I wish to become rich, buy Louis vuitton bags, gucci and versace shoes have a sports car, a home in switzerland, work in the fashion world, designing clothes or doing the make up on runway models, making a movie, watching every movie on earth and being part of a group of cinema addicts, have a partner maybe, and most of all buy euthanasia (money can't buy happiness but it can buy the ethernal sleep)I'm discussing my gender identity too, that's very confusing, but most of all I want all of this 'beautiful' thing called life to be over. I hope the f words can be said here, it's hard to express my feelings, I know.."
I always get downvoted on Reddit no matter what I post or comment,I've deleted most of my posts and comments that have less than 1 point because they're embarrassing. But they happened. People have downvoted me. Everyone hates me and wants me to die.
I need to talk to someone.,"Hi. To the right of this page is a list of resources, including a whole bunch of people who you can talk to, who can help. You can speak to someone, or text chat. Hope that helps. "
Questions you'd want to ask?,"Have you know anyone that killed themselves? If you have do you have any questions that you wish you could ask them?I plan on killing myself next week and I want to leave a note answering any questions my ""family"" or ""friends"" may have. Thanks."
I need some perspective,"So currently I am starting sophomore Tuesday at a large University and just moved to a new house. I feel as though I have no friends besides my girlfriend but I don't want to be a burden for her, practically all my friends from freshmen year don't want to hang out with me because a person in that friend group and I often butt heads and they are living with him so I can't see them. I'm rather quiet and am terrible at making friends I honestly can say I have no idea how to make friends. Also I am 6 hours away from home and all I want to do is just be done. I've gone through moments like this and survived but this just hurts so much right now. What do I do?"
I can't find a reason,"Every morning before I get out of bed I need to find a reason not to kill myself
Some days I don't get out of bedToday is one of those days where I've been lying here staring at the ceiling and my phone for fucking hours and I just don't know what to do - I can't think of any reason worth getting out of bed today other than killing myself"
Yesterday I sat on a scaffolding. Today I want to go there again.,"In the night there are no people around that place, it's the 6th floor and the exact place I searched for a long time.
It's pretty much the perfect place for me to die and I've searched for it a long time.
Yesterday I didn't jump for one single reason and now I'm dreaming of going back tonight and jump. This time I wouldn't make the mistake which held me back."
It's been five years.,"Five years since these thoughts started. A classmate died tragically and suddenly in an accident. He was popular, well-liked, and for good reason. A really nice guy. I remember the assembly after it happened. I sat alone. Everyone else was hugging and remembering. And I sat alone. They all said it ""shouldn't have been him.""It was at the funeral I realized it should have been me. There were so many eulogies, fond memories, so many people touched. And I knew then I wouldn't have any of that; I'd fizzle out and not even be noticed.I wish I could say I spent the last five years making something of myself, becoming better, but I haven't. No friends. Social anxiety. Ugly. Fat. Alone. I think about ending it often, but I think the only thing holding me back is that I'm too afraid to go through with it. And so I sit here. Five years later. Thinking of this kid from high school. He deserved his shot; I don't. It should have been me. "
"I turned 18 this week. I don't have any dreams or goals, and waking up is just painful.","I'm not saying I'm a special snowflake because I know most of you on this sub go through worse stuff than me. I know nobody asked for this, so I don't really want to be a whiny brat, but I've honestly had enough. I'm a shitty person. I don't reply to messages from people who are still actually trying to talk to me because it all seems pointless to me. I leave my bed only if it's absolutely necessary, and I hate spending time with others no matter how important those people are to me. I used to love art, but I can't bring myself to create things anymore. At the beginning of summer break I was like, ""I'm going to draw every single day for the following two months, so I can form a habit I'd like to maintain and work hard on becoming an artist."" Well, guess what. Summer break's ending today, and I only sketched once, and it ended up being a piece of garbage. I realized if I actually wanted to be an artist, I'd be passionate and wouldn't know how to live without constantly making art, and that's the exact opposite of me. I usually ended up hating my artwork anyways, so I think there are people much more determined to become artists, and they sure as hell deserve it more than someone like myself. I'm just pretty much numb most of the time, but whenever a tiny inconvenience creeps into my life, my brain instantly goes to 'suicidal mode'. Crippling anxiety takes over me, and my life goes from 0 to -10. The only thing I can think about is death. I use it as a coping mechanism 'Nothing I do matters because we will all die anyways' to make my anxiety less extreme, but it's not very healthy since I start planning my own suicide. I'm changing schools and I'll be in a completely new environment, which makes things even worse because I can't stop imagining the worst scenarios. Basically, right now the best option I have is hanging myself. I messed up everything in my life. I failed my driving exam on my birthday, I couldn't take the pressure at my previous school and I can't keep making art. I honestly don't have any dreams or a future. The only thing I genuinely want is peace.(Please do not suggest therapy/medication. I can't get any professional help right now.)"
I cant handle it anymore,"i have been fighting with depresiion for a while now

Hi all. 14 y/o boy who just fucked his whole life up.,"Im writing this from a chromebook for school while my parents are downstairs talking about how disgusting they think i am and are 1 second away from sending me to military school. I'd rather not talk about what i did, but heres the jist of it. I was on instagram messing with my friends, and some kid's moms were talking to me and i was being a dick to the moms. I called them worthless, said fuck you and told them to fuck off. I regret it, but my life is fucked. All social media is done, my phone is taken away, i cant hang with friends, all i can do is go to school, come home, do homework, and suffer. I see no reason why i shouldnt just blow my brains out."
There's nothing left for me.,"I feel like the only thing I have left to do is to just end, it I'm sick of fighting this shit. I screw up every relationship and job I get. I can't do it anymore suicide is the one thing that I actually look forward to anymore because it's the only thing that's guaranteed, it's the only way to be sure I won't be miserable anymore. I'm a fucking piece of shit and it's better if I'm gone. I can't even buy a damn gun because I've been committed to a mental hospital. I feel like in stuck here and I don't want to be anymore. I don't want time to realize what I'm doing I just want to be gone like turning off a light switch."
Is being too lazy a valid reason for suicide?,"I have no plan on going to college (I've gone to one abroad, but I didn't study at all and soon I dropped out) or doing a trade, I have no energy except for going to work and coming home to lay in bed all day and watching shows on my laptop. I have no ambitions, no desire to do any hobbies - basically I hate learning anything, I find reading boring, listening to educational talks boring, doing complex shit boring and too hard. Everything is just fucking boring or requires effort.I think I'm pampered and I keep whining about my ""problems"" on the Internet, because I can't be bothered to move my arse to fix anything. Before you ask - no, I don't want to make video games (programming is stupid and boring anyway) and no, I don't like anything in particular (I used to like video games, but now I'm too lazy to play them. I buy one every once in a while, but it doesn't take long for me to get bored.)I'm just a nobody. I have nothing to work towards, I'm dumb to grasp basic concepts like taxes (and have no desire to learn about it.) or my laws. I don't even fucking know who my politicians are.And yes, I'm writing this out of attention, since I'm powerless to do something about it."
I'm really pathetic and am having a hard time holding on,"The truth is I'm a pathetic excuse for a human. I'm suicidal because I can't get a girlfriend. I know that's a dumb reason but it really hurts me not being able to get a girlfriend. I've never had a girlfriend in my life or even gotten close. Some girls reject me and say it's because I'm ugly, the rest give me reasons like ""it's not you its me"" ""your sweet but I'm not ready for a relationship"", just stuff because they are trying to be nice. I've come to accept that I'm never going to have a partner in my life, and it's my destiny to be alone. Lots of people and therapist try to sell to me that I'll meet some girl that will like me some day, but I just can't believe that anymore. I've known nothing but rejection and when I ask ladies to honestly tell me how I look they tell me I'm ugly. I have friends, I have family, I'm not financially insecure, I'm able to do hobbies or activities of interest at a fair rate, I shouldn't have a reason for being suicidal but its how I really feel. I've tried many times just focusing on bettering myself just for the sake of myself, and it helps for a little while, but the pain of being alone doesn't ever go away. I'm so pathetic that I cuddle with a blanket that I wadded up into kinda the shape of a woman because I don't anybody to cuddle with for real. For a long time cuddling with that blanket brought me a little bit of comfort, but now it's not enough, and I don't know what to do. I really feel worthless and I just find it hard to find reasons to live."
I'm not sure what to do,"I have an online friend who is telling me he'll be dead in a few years. I'm not sure what to do as I am in a different country as him, and don't know him irl. I do have his Facebook and know what town he's in. I'm not sure if I should call the cops or just try to talk him out of it."
Life is a joke,"I've fucked up everything in my life. Every relationship, every opportunity, everything. I'm an unwanted mistake. I'm adopted and still fatherless. Nobody wants me and I hate myself bc I've created this situation. I really feel like I can't get any lower and the next step is to kill myself. I've always looked forward to the day I died. I'm sorry"
"Redditor looks to be suicidal, I have no idea what to do","I'm a subscriber to  (it's about building your own rockets and launching them for fun as a hobby)Someone posted about wanting to launch a rocket for cheap. He said he was disabled, you know what let me just link his post. .I'm not sure why but I went through his history and it brought me to tears. This guy is terminal and in constant pain. He was just looking for a hobby because he sits in the same spot everyday and all he has is his laptop. No one cares. I sent him a message saying that I care and that he shouldn't hurt himself. I don't know what to do, I'm crying right now.Direct link to his profile "
I'm not good at titles,"I can't describe how I feel. It's like I can't figure out whether or not this is an emotion or pattern of thinking or what. The world seems like a cruel joke right now - and all the 'happiness' and 'hope' that we tend to cling onto seems at best, meaningless. It's fake. I can't tell whether or not I'm the one deluded with extreme negativity or if I'm truly seeing the world in an honest light and those who believe things can get better are wrong. It's like everything is ridiculously insignificant. I feel like nothing matters, there's no point, and I'm not capable of doing anything to change. At least, not for the long run, nothing that would last or have a substantial effect on my life. I certainly don't want to live - but dying isn't an option. I just feel trapped. And lost. "
I wish I could switch places with depressed rich people,At least not worrying about making through the month and spending cash on anything I want would be less to worry about.I keep buying lottery tickets. How naive of me.
Tears in the shadow. pt1,"I... figured out that I need to talk to someone before I kill myself. So... uhm... I 'll post this shit here. I still haven't finnished writing this, so I'll probably post the rest... one day. Who knows. w/eAnd well, I'm here. With you. Or, rather, with no one. And well, I must confess, for those who do not know what this means, it will make no sense. So, just maybe, I should explain a little what I'm talking about.
Yeah, indeed. I should do that. Maybe even you, I mean, whoever you are, are confused about this. Well, maybe, I should start by explaining who is the ""you"" I'm talking to, right? No...? Well, in the end it is my choice so...Well, dear you, you are... yourself. Crazy right? Oh, still does not understand? You are YOURSELF. Look at the mirror, or at the webcam. You are the person who is, by whatever reasons or means, reading this note. So... uhm... maybe I should confess to you why I'm writing this... right? Well, it's always up to you if you're going to read this, or not, so... I hope you stay with me. Just a little longer? Maybe? ............Wait. You're still here? Ha, strange one. Okay, well, that means you do wanna understand why all this. Let's start... by the beginning, maybe?So... uhm... that would start... 23  years ago. Brazil. Yeah, that's when I'm born. Nononono, don't worry, won't take long to tell everything, I'll make it quick. I was born. Mom and Dad happily married wadahwadahwadah...
No, that's not so true. Mom wasn't really happy with dad, dad was kinda on drugs, durign those days. When I was three they broke up. No this is not about being raised without a dad. Well maybe it is, I wouldn't know the difference...
Well, maybe you can sort that out? Uhm? Oh yeah, sorry. I'll keep going.
So... 2~3 years old, no dad... I didn't miss him during those days though. Not that I remember. Well, time goes on and I'll enter school. Big school, full of peoples and... friends?  Wouldn't call them that, but okay, I guess. Let's just say... most little friends were not very friendly, or w/e. Can't really remember much from those days, can only remember being rejected QQCouple years later, joined elementary school. Not sure how it works where you live, but here we have 9years in elementary school, then 3 in highschool, then college.
So, uhm... 1st year I kinda learned to read... except I already knew. Kinda. Well, it was kinda fun. 2nd year I... don't really remember. I remember I wasn't very popular, and I remember I, occasionally, would shit myself. Yeah, quite literally. Disgusting, I know. Not very higienic also, true. but, well, that was when everything started to go wrong. Bullying and all that.It followed me untill I went to college. The bullying, no the shitting myself part. That stopped somewhere before 5th year. So uhm... I'll not talk about the bullying part here. I don't want to. Wouldn't feel right, So, expect random cut offs and subjects. Those will be to run from the bullying subject. Okay?
So... where was I... Oh! Yeah, well, I was kind of smart though, so that's a plus. Kinda, cuz I was way too talkative also, and would run through all the class untill everyone would scold me and yell at me and all that. Well, I... just have always liked to play. And since the subjects were kind of... way too easy (lol). So... I had nothing to focus on. Well... lame excuese, I get it, but still, that was me. So... uhm.. something else happenned at that time. Mommy got a boyfriend. This big, huge, tall, FAAAAAT, boyfriend. Nice guy though. Rude as rock, but nice. I think. Uhm... Well, he had 2 kids. So... I kinda got a brother and a sister. I think that you would call the my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. Well, we do not have a word for that here, so... they were them. We would see each other every weekend, once at my home, once at their home, untill 5thyear of elementary school.
Oh, by the way, lemme tell who I used to live with:
Mom(would work all day. Usually we wouldn't see each other much as she usually would get home late and leave very early in the morning to work. But weekends were great, and she was the most absolutely gorgeous, beautiful woman. Still, when we would fight, she had this anger inside. Against me. As if she hheld some hatred towards me deep inside her. Because I was her exhusband's son. But when we were not fighting, she has always been the best.
Grandma(takes care of her home untill today. Can barely walk without feeling pain in her ankles, but would walk a thousand miles as long as there is some shop with... well, anything from clothes to house decoration. But, mainly, shirts.)
Grandpa(Used to work a lot in an industry(as a guard during the night), and sleep during the afternoon. Later on, he used to take kids to school on his Kombi.(YUP. He had a School Kombi. Certified and everything.) Very funny caring and... but wouldn't want to make him angry.)
And, last,
Uncle.(Oh... uncle. Might write a whole sotry just about how he made my life hell. Not directly, or willingly. But still, made it hell. Every morning he and grandma would argue about his religion, or about what he wanted to eat, or about his dick size, or about how his chest was... sunken in the middle. Yeah, strange topics. And I would listen to that everyday. Yeeah, every single day. Annoying, but... I ended up getting used to it. A videogame/RPG addicted. Only good thing he gave me.(Besides the fact that once he looked at me and, during an arguemente with my grandma, he said that I didn't need to worry, cuz my dick definitely would have a good size, cuz my dad's dick also had a goold size. I had... like 7 or 8 years old.)Well, these are the people that lived with me.
So, uhm... I had a few friends at the townhouse. There were... 10 buildings, if I'm not mistaken. So, there were the summer friends, those that would appear only in summer and the year long friends, that would stay throughout the year. There were a few, and and whole lot lot of stories that are quite funny and interesting, but none really important for this. So lemme make the 2nd to 4th years quick.2nd year, I remember absolutely nothing besides shitting myself and everyone laughing at me. That's it. Besides having the best grades of the class, and being talkative as hell to whoever sit besides me, wether they liked it or not though. But, of course, this wasn't nice.3rd year, good teacher, I fell in love with this blond girl that everyone else was in love with, I had no chance, and I felt really bad about that. I still had the best grades. Kinda become the class's clown, to try and make friends. Didn't work at all. Talked to mom about not having friends. She argued with someone at school that wnet to class and kinda ordered other kids to make friends with me. I felt like shit and learned that I should not talk to my mom about this, otherwise I'd be only more embarrasesed about that. At 6 to 7 years old, my problems with friends would have to be my own, and not anyone else's. 4th year, good teacher, I fell in love with this other blond girl that everyone else fell in love  also. I still had no chance, and felt even worse about that. I still had the best grades. Had a rival that year... Good guy, really funny. Not smart at all, he failed completely that year also. BUT, he had a girlfriend. Or something like that. Still had few to no friends. Not the best of the years.5th year, good teachers. Yeah, had 2 that year. One of them would laugh a little at my silly jokes. But still the same thing. Oh, by the way, blod girl #1 was back to my class. Kinda fell in love with her again. But there were other girls that were as hot as her. And still, few to no friends. My grades gradually fell this year. At 8-9 years old, I remember having spent nights crying thinking about killing myself. Also got my first computer this year, and loved the gameboy advance emulator, Gunz:The Duel and played the demo of dungeon siege so many times that I can't really remember.6th year, hard one. Went to live in another city, since my mom decided to live with her boy friend. But she had just joined college, and would stay away most of the day. Well, this time I would actually only see  her at weekends. StepDad wasn't so bad... unless when he had to protect his daughter. Then... everything was my fault x) Either way, hell would describe my experience in this place. Not many friends, I was cocky about my brain, didn't really get good grades cuz wouldn't really focus on school. My brother-in-law left home during winter to live with his mom. My stepdad was unbearable for him.7th year, even tougher. 6 months after his son leaving, stepdad would have his good days and hell days. Mom wouldn't really listen to me, not htat I tried a lot but... still. My grades were kinda better, I was starting to make friends, kinda. Went thourhg a hell lot of situtations that year. Learned a lot, met MSN. Had a fake e-mail and account where I would trick horny grown up lesbians into sending me erotic vids, nudes and showing themselves on webcam. Also used to join UOL's chat and fake myself into someone else. Apparently, I was really good at that, since I got a fair ammount of friends this way. 8th year: bad year. Back to the starting city, the one where I was born. And... back to old school. Everyone had grown bonds, and all that, I came back as a strange. Everything was different, and I felt really out of place. Made a few friends though. I was still playing the duel though, whenever I had internet... almost never. Lost contact with everyone that I had on msn before. Bad thing, cuz I was starting to discover that I could be quite appealing as myself, if I didn't show my face. Kinda made a girl fall in love with me. Just kinda, but was enough to fell a little good about myself... And enough to feel that someday, someone, would love me indeed. By who I am. Not just cuz I was family or w/e.
At this point, I was already alone at home. My bedroom was the only room in my floor, and no one would go there oftenly. Loved the peace, hated the loneliness. My sister would occasionaly go there and make me company. Too bad we weren't very close, I liked her. 9th year My sister(in-law) went away to live with her mom. So... I was completely lonely. 100%. Untill I met people from 1 grade below. Started talking to them, fell in love and... at the end of the year I kissed her. Curious fact: I dated her for 2 weeks before kissing her. She went to live in another city at the end of the year. Oh and there were these girls that were really friendly to me during the year. We kinda became best friends! Good old times. Oh, and in an arts class, someone saw the volume of my dick in through my pants. And I got a big dick kind of fame. hell yeah, that year was feeling good. Could I say it was the best year in my life? HELL YEAH IT WAS. Also, I started to play Wonderland Online. Good game, lots of people from everywhere but Brazil to talk with. That's when I learned english for real. Also, I discovered my dad would live and work besides my school, basically. Got very sad about that. Kinda started somewhat of a friendship with him. 1st year(highschool) Kept dating, through internet my girlfriend from last year. Lasted exactly 1 year, a couple hour less actually. I kinda of cheated on her after she went missing for a long time. I said kinda, cuz it was through sexting. With a girl from somewhere in europe, lithuania maybe. Could be a guy also. Who knows. Either way, got a good ammount of friends in game, didn't need irl friends anymore also. AFter all, all of them were just annyoing at this point. Most of them weren't inteligent enough to keep an interesting conversation, wouldn't know a thing about games, anime, computer or anything like this. They... basically, liked Big Brother and other... erm... nor very interesting programs. Also, TV was their main source of entertainment. I was into computer a lot more. Had a few internet friends. At the end when my girlfriend broke up with me, Kinda felt depressive though. I started playing volleyball somewhere in this year.2nd year Although I was depressive, I learned that... if I wanna feel better, I just need someone to get naked to me. So... I got a web girlfriend from an asian country. She was 10 years old but was deeply in love with me, as I was with her. Or so I thought. We started dating somewhere between 2nd and 3rd year, and we got along very well. Not much to talk about school, I just ignored it, mostly. Oh, by the way, I was playing volleyball this year. And that's the end of it also.3rd year NOW, this was a strange year. I was already kind of fluent at english and I had finnished the englishcourse outside school. School offered extra classes for the admission test for college(if you wanna get in a college here, you have to do this test. And your grades during elementary to highschool means absolutely nothing.) and I took it. Most of the time I ignored it though. Also, I started some dancing classes. Good old things. By the end of the year I had took the tests for the public colleges(considered to be the best in my country) and I was accepted at Mechanical Engineering. Theoretically  that should have been good. Well.... I'll stop here as I'm kinda tired. I'll finnish it later, if I'm still around or in the mood."
I wish I could be everyone's saviour,"I read through here and wish I could save each and everyone of you. Be the friend you need, the shoulder to cry on. I'm struggling myself and realising I can't help everyone just fucks me up even more. How am I supposed to tell someone a reason to keep trying when I don't see any reason myself? But at the same time I don't want to see anyone getting killed by this cruel world that leaves people destroyed. I love every one of you on here. We have to stick together. Work through it, day after day. "
I just don't see this working out exactly.,"I just don't think I was cut out for this shit.Things never, ever, ever get better. No matter how far ahead I get, all I really end up doing is failing and falling.This isn't about her, even though, I hear her voice inside my head, can see the fear and concern upon her face, hear her unspoken pleas with her eyes.[I've begun to cry.]I had a shitty week, beyond shitty, and I KNOW, this too shall pass, and I was finally, finally making progress, but now I've made fucking no progress. One step forward, a thousand steps back.I understand that I can't just quit, but god, how I want to.I have more to say, but now is no longer a good time."
Going to visit an internet friend who just attempted suicide. Need some help,"I have a close friend that I've known for some time over the internet, never actually met them irl though. They just attempted suicide (I think they're stable but i don't know for certain).I live several states away, I'm taking time off work to ride my bike and visit them.I work offshore in a very tough environment. I'm not a comforting person, my usual MO to people complaining or showing weakness is to tell them to quit fucking around and suck it up. I've also been told that I may have aspergers  (a mild form of autism that inhibits one's social abilities), but I'm not sure of that.I really don't know what I'm going to do when I get there. I'm partially afraid they'll be too ashamed to even see me.Any advice is welcome"
If I can't trust anyone then why live?,"Simply put my life has been rendered into a pile of complete chaos and bullshit. The following story is just too subjective for any one of my, ""friends"" to understand as they've reached a consensus in deeming my problems irrational and my plight unrelatible.
This is due to the way in which I present myself, I come of as a narcissistic introverted asshole with a monotone voice. This is merely a front which I deviced during my adolescence as I could never quite reconcile the love I had for even the most transient person in my life and their response towards me. Apparently I think that if I am rude in all my remarks that then it won't matter if I'am disappointed or even insulted by the other party's response because I will have, in my mind, deserved it. So now, about my life: I'am currently an 18 year old male attending university in the United States. Throughout high school I encountered many people, some of which manifested into my very best friends up until my junior year. This would mark an extremely negative year and turning point in my life as it was the first time I consumed LSD with my friend who I will call Chris. He was my role model throughout my adolescent years and more than I had hoped any friend could be. I loved him like a brother. Our acid trip was as normal as can be expected of two people trying psychedelics for the first time. That was until we got back to his place. Upon arriving Chris entered the shower with his girlfriend at the time for what seemed like an eternity. Then after that moment passed he suddenly appeared between myself and the television I happened to be watching at the time, restrained me to the chair, and repeated over and over again, ""life is a simulation"", ""life is a simulation"", ""life is a simulation."" Perhaps this may seem innocent enough to the average reader but any person who's done any kind've mind altering drugs knows just how despicable this truly was. Shortly there after I experience what can only be described as a psychotic episode. I faded in and out of conciousness for the rest of the night. All that I really recal is that I ended up back at my house with Chris and the rest of my so called friends hating me. Everyone that is except for a girl that I will Charlotte. She had been my friend for even longer than Chris and now that he was no longer in my life I naturally gravitated towards her to make sense of it all. At first for purely plutonic objectives which later blossomed into a romance. We dated for 3 months, she took my virginity, and broke up with me after I confessed that I had always secretly loved her throughout out long friendship. I now have no real friends. They invite me to party's but are always walking on eggshells hoping not to ignite the ever impending bad trip that they believe resides In my head, all except charlotte of course who knows what really took place that night but refuses to clarify on my behalf for fear of being ostrichized herself. Instead she distracts herself with the various ""shitty guys"" (her words not mine) that she frequently sleeps with then proceeds to complain to me about. I see her frequently at these gatherings on the weekends between all of my old friends, only to return to university alone. At these party's I frequently feign inhebriation only to pretend to fall asleep. Then I subsequently spend the night either sneaking out the back to smoke or crying into my air up mattress, envious of her new dipshit confidant. Long story short chris' brain is baked from acid and is no longer capable of fending for himself I am desperately still in love with charlotte even though she betrayed me almost two years ago and I'am incapable of showing myself to the outside world who hates me. Death is imminent all because I can't stop thinking of how much I loveChris and Charlotte, my two best friends who I ruined."
Rant.,"I'm probably going to kill myself in the near future. Maybe tonight. Maybe just after I've packed for university later on in the week, because my room will be all clean. I'm sick of nobody taking me seriously. They'll regret it when I'm gone. I've just had yet another argument with one of my friends, of whom, I have a specific attachment to, and he's seriously tired of me. He's tired of me saying that he's going to abandon me because he has this cool new fucking boyfriend - who I have to admit, I'm jealous of, despite me not being romantically interested in my friend - he's tired of me pushing him away and pulling him back like nothing happened and repeating the fucking cycle for months, and years, and fuck knows what after that. I can't help it, I don't do these things on purpose, I just don't want to lose him. He'll have to lose me first. Fuck it."
Why even continue living?,"Haven't had a friend in 5 years. Never had a girlfriend. Turning 20 in January and still don't have a single social media account because I have nobody to add anyway. I have aspergers and feel like it's impossible for me to accomplish anything socially. I was even tempted to asking a girl in one of my college classes to lunch, but turns out she was 6 years older than me and probably sees me as a kid, so I didn't even bother. I tried befriending one of my former programming professors and he ended up ghosting me after a few texts. I tried lifting weights to boost my confidence and ended up injuring my knees and lower back because of my terrible squat form that I spent weeks on trying to perfect. I even failed a fucking elementary algebra class in a community college for christs sake.
I feel so stupid and inadequate.The only reason I'm holding back from killing myself is my family.  I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 10 years old. I'm thinking of just doing it, I know my family will feel horrified, but it's better than feeling this way for another 10 years."
i'm bipolar but my mom don't think i am,"okay so i am bipolar and my mom won't get me help for it, i'm a mess idk what to do. i'm very suicidal. any advice helps"
I'm destined to kill myself,"I've been feeling suicidal since 2012, but I've probably had depression for longer. I tried telling someone about it, and I lost all my friends, I tried applying to disability, and I got denied, even though I have a history of this, documented by doctors. I can't keep a job long enough, I just can't. There's nothing left for me. I just want to make myself bleed and hang myself on a tree. Everyone hates me, or will hate me if they don't already. I just want someone to push me over the edge already. I can't keep this up. It's only going to get worse and I know it."
"I'd do anything to die, but I'd never kill myself","For my entire life I've been left out of most things. I didn't play football as a child, didn't play XBox throughout middle school, and didn't feel comfortable talking to girls. That all began to change one night at 3 AM. I got a text from a girl who thought I was cute, and we talked. And we talked. And we talked. We ended up dating for a couple months. I became more comfortable in social settings and met another girl I became close with. Tonight, both of them blocked me on all socia media. I want to make excuses, but I know its my fault. I'm clingy, irritating, and never happy. And now I'm alone. My grandpa passed away a couple weeks ago, my dad is in the hospital, my mom lost her job, and my grandma has stage 4 cancer. School just started and I didn't make the soccer team. I just see no reason to keep living right now. Nothing's gonna get better, it hasn't for the last 14 years. I feel so alone right now and don't even know what to do. If anybody actually cared about me enough to read here, thank you."
I've had enough of this cruel world,"Everywhere you always see positive outcomes, happy endings to stories, and everything wraps up so neatly. Well, this is real life, where everybody is against each other and hides it under the guise of politeness. That I feel, is worse than outright hostility. Pretending that toxic behavior is okay. Which brings me to the second point, how the only ""effective"" way of discouraging suicide is by guilt-tripping you against making the one decision you should have ultimate control over. Who cares if they feel bad? Everyone will be mourning the loss of a child or sibling, friend or stranger, but never who you are. Just the idea of you. Why keep living and spare their feelings, when you've had enough? Shouldn't you have control over your own life? Sorry if this is sounds dramatic, there are more important issues around"
I'm lost,"In the first place, please excuse my grammar and mistakes, I'm romanian and rusty with english. So... it all started when my best friend committed suicide together with another common friend of us ( 15 and 17 years old ). They jumped off of an high building. And I saw the video from the police officers. He was ready to jump, started to run, then he stopped... he just stopped at the edge of the building and tried to get back on the roof but he slipped, he.. what's the word... he tripped over the building's border. This happened in 2015. And to this day I still think and cry about it. I often just imagine how is it to feel in the last moment that you don't want to die actually and try to save yourself but you trip over the border and fall from height, what he was thinking about... his body was broken in two pieces. This is still haunting me. I swear I'm not a liar, but sometimes I can feel him. I can feel he's with me, he's here, I feel his presence. I had dreams with him and they seem so real.  After this tragedy, I was raped. I was in the cemetery at my friend's funeral with some candles. It was a day of summer. I would like not to go into details because I'll start crying but after this shit happened my mom didn't believed me and she said if that really happened is because I don't believe in god and that's his way to punish me. My father did nothing. I was on my own.My friend who committed suicide ( the one with 15 years old ) had a little brother. Yesterday he committed suicide too at the age of 16... he just laid his neck on the rails and waited for the train to arrive. I can't get this out of my head. I just think how is it like to lay down there and feel the rails shaking because the train is coming. To hear the honk of the train and to know this is the last minute of your life. What's haunting me the most is that I think is my fault. Last week I got nervous out of nowhere and I was thinking something bad is going to happen. And in that night I had a dream with my best friend telling me "" don't let him come to me "". I didn't know what to do... I was stupid, freaked out, I just think I had a chance to stop this. To stop his brother from suicide. In that week I have saw him too, but not him. It was like... I was getting ready to get out and go get some bread from the store and when I closed the door and turned right I saw his little brother, his form, his shadow like because when I blinked it wasn't there anymore. I was thinking it was because of my dream I had and just imagining it. How stupid I am...  I should have known that I need to talk with him.I've lost my good friends, the situation in my family is not good and I'm feeling lost. I have moments when I just sit at the balcony looking down and thinking "" what if i just go a bit closer to the edge and then just jump "" and things like this. I have problems with the paranormal too. They're rather evil and freak the shit out of me or just sad and moving things and doing minor things. I just don't know what to do and the thought of suicide is getting stronger. I don't want any antidepressants I just need some advice and ideas what to do to get rid of my shitty mood because then the ""bad"" spirits will go away too, I just know it because when I was little nothing evil has approached me, just small entities. Since I had this thoughts and mood my life is getting worse and I can't get rid of this. I have already set up my suicide note just in case of a breakdown and thinking about self-harming again but I don't want this I just want to be happy and I try but I can't. I have anxiety too... I just want some help.."
if i call a hotline will they track my phone and send someone?,i don't know if this is the appropriate place for this but i want to know before i call them.
I really want to end it all,"I'm 31 yo I've been fighting real hard to live for the last 3 years, I've been doing everything in my power to make life worth living but I think I've lost the battle."
"""you never know what it felt like being in their shoes"" and i'm getting tired of hearing such excuses.","i'm getting sick and really tired from understanding people that pushed me way too far...i have done nothing with my life for far too long and people tell me that ""IT WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FAULT BECAUSE YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING, WHEN YOU FELL DOWN, YOU NEED TO GET BACK UP NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES, BE IT YOUR FAULT OR THEIRS  SO THEREFORE ITS YOUR LOSS IN THE LONG RUN"" when in reality i've lost ALOT in trying to catch up. majority of real life people i talked to always tell me that ""just try and understand the people that you are with and know that they are suffering like you but under different circumstances"" heck my brother just realized how hard my life was before and up to now and how i carried everything when he went off to places, he went all apologizing to me. DESPITE me losing everything.    my parents just realized this year the gravity of their mistake and they are willing to send me back, when my projects and what was suppose to be for my CV and portfolios are finally ruined.
despite the numerous warnings i gave them of how it will damage me in the long run and the the very confusing state of things, my parents are heavily threatening me of being send to God knows where
where there is literally death and isolation
just to teach me a lesson (in trying to get along with people and learn how to kiss A** just to get to places) and put the blame solely on me    if ever that does happened, i'd gladly embrace death with open arms. heck the list of shit people did to me...lied to, stabbed in the back, they even borrowed money to which they never paid, insulted at and even straight up created rumors and spread secrets just to get what they wanted. even made fun and it bordered into bullying the hobbies that i had. and even being told that people have been telling me that i'm not as strong as i CLAIMED(which is not true) myself to be... FUCK and this is the reason why i enjoy the company of animals more than people. "
I'm gonna intentionally OD soon can someone talk to me while I wait,Well I never thought I would be here contemplating suicide. First off I'm homeless and a opiate/alcohol addict. I quit doing opiates and drinking about 1 month ago but I recently just became homeless so I moved in with my mother. My mom is a alcoholic but she was clean up until recently. I'm depressed and using opiates/alcohol to cope with the stress of being homeless since I don't know any other way to cope. I recently just found out my mother is drinking again and she used to help me with my stress but now that's she's drinking again she is never home. I feel alone and the only thing I got left to at least help me cope is opiates and alcohol so obviously I relapsed after 1 month of being clean. In a couple hour I'm gonna load up a rig so I can intentionally OD. All I want is someone to talk to in my last few hours. Sorry for the terrible wording and grammar I'm shaking really bad due to my anxiety attacks. I'm not asking for help only a friend in my last hours.
On the verge of suicide,"I've jut recently moved in with my girlfriend and her mom, due to my parents kicking me out of my house. (They're selling it, so it wasn't because of a bad relationship)After a week of moving, I quit my job because it became unbearable. This was 3 months ago. I've been looking for jobs and get extreme anxiety when I apply. My girlfriend and I have been getting more and more hostile (verbally, not physical) We argue just about everyday and it just makes me not want to do anything anymore.Just today, we were driving to get lunch and we sparked an argument and I told her to just take me home because I didn't feel like being in public. Without going into extreme details, we were both at fault but won't admit it.I'm not solely feeling depressed just because of my girlfriend and I are arguing, it's just part of it. I usually wake up and just want to sleep all day. I feel useless and mopey throughout the day. I'm also extremely angry most of the time and don't know why. I'm scared and really don't know what to do."
Is there a website that I can talk to someone about suicide via instant messenger?,"So. I need to talk to someone about suicide. I don't want to call the national helpline because it's a voiced call. Also, I'm scared they'll call the police on me if I say something about actually killing myself. I've found a few, but most of them suck, and a few of them are Christian oriented. They always end up making me listen to them rant about god until I decide I've had enough. Anyway, if there is a good one out there, please tell me. "
Dead soon,���suicide loss survivors�۝ can suck my dick.ALL  ���suicide loss survivors�۝ CAN FUCKING SUCK MY DICK
Getting better,Day to day are a struggle to deal with my depression. Starting to get over my ex but still feeling less motivated to do anything. Maybe joining gym will help .
I just want peace,"This world has a lot to offer. But not for me. I'm just not right for this world. Life doesn't like me. And I don't like life, the only reason I haven't done it yet is I don't wanna leave my brothers behind. But I'm starting to think it would be better they knew me as their brother who killed himself at 17, rather than their brother who is a complete failure in life."
I'm so very overwhelmed,"I really don't care anymore
I just can't do this anymore with everything filling my thoughts up.
I'll never be on the right direction and everything I do is wrong
I don't even remember what I was going to say anymore
I don't know
I don't wanna feel movement I just want to be off drugs
I will never have her
I will never do anything right
I just want lines to snort and to be left the fuck alone but I want someone to talk to me
I can't make up my mind "
I'm sorry I'm to weak.,This account will also be a suicide note for my family. When i see my life and where I'm headed i start to panic. I already have a decent plan to kill myself with i just don't have the resources yet. i feel like I'm choking. I love you life just wasn't cut out for me. It's to painful.
Just dont know what to do anymore...,"I feel like this might be it. I have bipolar so i know this is just me being depressive as hell and who knows tomorrow i might feel too good for my own good. But my depressive episodes have been getting worse. I used to have a friend i could talk to when i felt bad but recently i feel like we've grown apart and dont feel like i can turn to him anymore...i feel like im bothering him. It just hurts so goddamn much. I dont know what to do anymore, dont know how much more i can take. I know theres only so much a stranger can do over the internet but someone please. Help me. I"
"Broke up with boyfriend for college, went to a psych ward two weeks into college and now I'm back home. He has moved on.","Hey Reddit,I'm a 19F and I recently went to college. I've struggled with anxiety and depression. In the worst of it, I started dating a guy who was 17 (m) at the time when I was 18 and now we are 18 and 19. He was one of the two people outside of my family that made me remember I was like able, that made me think I was worth it all. He wasn't my therapist and I didn't burden him, I was just struggling with some mental issues while we were together. Thus, falling in love made me feel like I was good enough for some people. We continued to date for a year and a half. After all my friends left for college and I preceded with a a gap year, I got to know his friends. I am really insecure and I remained convinced they didn't like me, they just dealt with me because I was there. He would say that wasn't true, but I believed it. So, he became someone that helped me see my value.I left for college three weeks ago. We ended things the morning I left. However, we were always friends first and decided we still wanted to be close friends. A week ago, I was so suicidal I found myself in a ward and was released 36 hours later. I was released so soon because college is across the country. My dad flew over to to take me home so I can receive care closer to home.I called him the next day after I got out and he told me he had moved on. Two weeks after we ended our relationship. To be honest, I was relieved because I don't think I could have been able to focus on my care and be in a relationship.I am also friends with his girlfriend. She is also way more funny, creative, social and cute than I could ever be. It's hard not to compare. They will be great together because when they started being friends I had a feeling that they would get together. I even asked him if he would pursue her after I left and he said ""maybe"". What hurts even more is that everyone predicted it would happen. I predicted it would happen the moment they started being friends. He is a year younger than her so they would be able to date for a longer time. What if she makes him happier than I did?I saw him the day after I returned home. We still want to be in each other's lives because we were always good friends. Still, he seems aloof about some things. When we met he was distant. I wanted to be frank about how our relationship would be moving forward so I put out my terms and he agreed to these terms and said he wants the same thing. However, after a couple days it was obvious he doesn't really care what happens to me. I've tried to keep in contact with him and he is distant. I wouldn't be upset if he didn't want to be in contact as he enters this new relationship but he said he did. Also, it's two weeks in after a long relationship, what the FUCK? I'm not angry at him or her, but it still feels fast. Some people take longer than others and I know this doesn't measure how much our relationship meant to him, but it's still hard. It would be easier if we were on bad terms and I could call him a jerk and her a bitch. But we aren't.It's hard because my friend group was around his friends. I was never convinced they actually liked me. I only went to things because he was going and let me know about them. Now that I'm not his girlfriend there is no reason for me to be invited. I feel alone.I know I have my family and I know I have my older friends, but they are all off for college and all of his (and I thought my) friends are around here. I know there are people out there that care about me, but my depression is so bad right now that I keep thinking nobody actually does. None of my friends give a shit. I feel like everyone would be happier if I was gone because they would have nothing to worry about. Especially now that my ex boyfriend, someone who I would always say to myself ""well at least he likes me"", when I convince myself nobody else does, is out of the picture. I'm not annoyed he doesn't want to be involved, of course he doesn't if it's not required of him anymore. I just feel abandoned. Everyone who says they would be sad if I was gone has their own baggage to deal with. I'm just adding to their misery by being here. If I was gone, they could cope and move on. Also, being back home and having to figure out what to do with my life is terrifying. The options in front of me are overwhelming. If life is just heartbreak, insecurity, and scary decisions I don't want to live it. It all hurts too much. This is where the anxiety kicks in, I start to get panics because I know I don't actually believe these things, my depression is just so bad it's muddling up my brain. I feel like I need to prioritize my care but I want to try and get a job too. What if I put it off and there are no jobs left? TLDR: my boyfriend and I split up two weeks ago. He has moved on and has a new girlfriend. They will be great together. We were still on friendly terms but it is distant. I'm starting to convince my self he doesn't actually care what happens to me. It's still hard Reddit because he was one of my best friends. I'm loosing a best friend. "
"everything in my life, is the way i've felt forever, but emotional involvement in an abusive person has fucked me over more, and i cant look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted.","i want to keep this part short because typing it all out is going to hurt, i was with woman, woman abused me, a few months ago, she ignored me after saying really upsetting things, I cut half of my arm off , didn't mean for it to be so deep, but it was, 28 stitches later, muscular and nerve scarring, permanant loss of strength in my arm, and she knew that she contributed to my feelings that night. now currently, her family fucked me over, i have not done a single fun thing in over a year, and they said i'd be coming with them to the pne at playland or cultus lake waterslides, then when i leave to go to my house instead of theirs because my (now ex's, probably, who knows, she may get me back in when i hear from her) girlfriends aunt was coming to visit and apparently is so fucking weird that she didn't feel comfortable sleeping in the same house as a stranger like me (who has been dating her damn neice for over a year). so i leave and then find out they lied and i have to pay out of my broke ass, they know i didn't have enough money. now, this girl, has made me give up on myself, i still have an impacted wisdom tooth because i was too unmotivated to go to the appointment, and i regret it, living with her i brushed my teeth 3 times in like a month or two, my face looks ugly, im scared i have bone loss in my jaw, my smile looks different, and im obsessing over all of it. and i want it to end"
"Worried about my partner, am I over thinking?","As the title states, I'm worried about my partner.Over the past few weeks there has been a few concerning comments from him. An expression of helplessness/hopelessness, another about how alone he feels, that he ""has no friends"". Just tonight he expressed how sad he was summer was over and that he wished it could last forever before telling me he was going to miss me.  He is a Teacher, so back to school means seeing me less as our work schedules are quite different. I know for a fact that he has had suicidal thoughts in the past, and there has been at least one prior attempt. He's not spoken much on this topic but I have made it clear that I am here for him whenever/where ever. Tonight after saying this he was getting some of his things together as he was about to go home saying ""I'll bring different things next time."" This struck me as odd because we spend 90% of our time at my apartment, and these items are almost always here. It felt as though he was ""cleaning up""  so to speak, so I wouldn't have to.I asked him if he was okay, and vocalized that I was concerned and scared that he might do something. I told him how much he means to me and that I love him more than anything in the world, all of which is true. I made sure he knows I am here for him no matter what and that he can talk to me about anything. He looked me in the eye and said he wasn't planning anything, and that he was okay, but there was a profound sadness in his eyes. Before he left he said I could come with him if I was concerned, but I told him I trusted him. I feel like that may have been a mistake, but I feel like I also need to trust him and believe what he says. I feel like I'm over processing but that now seemed like a request for help. He called me when he got home to say he loved me and that he was getting into bed, which is a fairly normal routine for us. He promised to text me when he gets up also. Am I overreacting here, or do I have validity in my concern? "
1 Month,"In 1 month I'm going to end my life. I have quit my job, my lease is up in 1 month, and everything is in place. Why wait a month you say? I'm going to spend it doing what I want. I'm going to spend this month playing video games in my apt talking to my friends and just doing what I love which is gaming and drinking and just relaxing. I'll enjoy one last birthday at the end of the month and that will be it.
I can't fix the things in my life, I'm too far in, things are too dark. But at least I will get to be happy for a month and enjoy myself without work or stress and just get to be me. It will be interesting. October 5th here I come. "
Im becoming a monster,"I fucked my life up so bad. I don't feel a single goddamn thing anymore. I don't know who I am anymore. I've been calling and calling to get a therapist and no one's fucking ever available!!! I fucking hate this shit!!!! I've cheated and treated all.my exes like shit and had numerous amounts of hookups and shit and today was my last one. Not only was it terrible but it really made me look back to one of my exes who I can't believe cared about me so much. He did so much for me but I was blind as fuck!! I Fucking hate myself so much right now. Everything's starting to fall apart and it's like im on a ride I cant get off of. It's scares the shit outta me. I have a friend who I currently chat with long distance. We dated for a bit but I ended up cheating on him twice. He still wants me in his life though but I just can't trust him anymore. I get paranoid he's keeping me out of spite. Usually when we talk, he starts to berate me. Calling me a pussy, bitch and a slut (im gay btw)  he told me he forgave me but I just don't see it. I've broken up with him SO MANY FUCKING TIMES and he keeps coming back. I feel bad for everything I did but everything is starting to pile up. I got no one to talk to or anyone who'd want to listen. I've been trying to get therapy but idk how it's gonna go cause it's labor day weekend and I s2g I feel like im going insane!! I can't stand feeling like this anymore. I feel like im stuck. Shit, I can't even draw anymore cause it won't stop playing in my mind. Idk what to do anymore...TL;DR im losing myself fast and all my creativity is gone and my life is going to shit. "
I want to fuck my life up so bad that the only way out is suicide,"Even though I wanna commit suicide, I think about how sad my family would be. I'll stay alive for my family, I'll get married to make them happy, then I'll have a new family... which will make me live till I die from some other thing than suicide.So I have to fuck my life up so bad that suicide is the only way out. I have to mess with bad people, get in lots of debt, anger people, become someone people hate (not that I'm someone people love anyway). Then I won't have to hold back and actually carry out the act that will free me from this hell."
I just want to stop being ghosted...,"I get it i'm just some pathetic annoying piece of shit but please at least tell me so i'm not as sad. I get left on read or see that i can't message the person anymore and it fucking defeats me. It puts me in such a sad, depressed, suicidal mood. I just want to end it all when it happens. Even worse when you see the person talking in a group chat and doesn't even bother to message you back. I understand that i sound like a selfish person but please i'm begging you if you no longer want to talk TELL ME. It will makes things so much easier but instead you leave me on read and make me want to die even more than i usually do."
I have hit the bottom and it sucks here,"I m am in my early 20s my life was kind of good until two years ago when I was doing exercise and herniated my l5 s1 disc resulting in excruciating sciatica I m always in pain..I should have done the surgery a while ago but I didn't since I was afraid that there is no one around to take care of me(I study abroad) also my friends left me and my ex girlfriend cheated on me ..so I m so alone all the time except when i go to classes there I see people around and might say hi to them but we never go through details abouts themselves or me because no one cares.I also never complain to my family to no let them worried Until recently when I told them I m about to do surgery...now my chance for surgery is gone because I've run out of holidays due to my internship . .lonely in pain and nothing to hope for I've found myself thinking of suicide the whole time, I've also been searching for ways to end it but the country I stay at no drugs are allowed and impossible to get ,,so I m left with only jumping off a building ..my building is 13th floor high so I think it's enough if not there is another building next to mine with 20sh floors .my only reason not to do it till now is my family but I guess when I m gone it won't matter hopefully...
Ps:I ve tried acupuncture swimming walking to improve my state and still trying but there is no noticed improvement maybe 5% better still can't do any activities like sex or partying so i m always in bed or in my standing desktop...goingg to classes hurt me so much because of sitting and I want to stand all the way in class but i m shy
English is not my first language so I m sorry if I made this post hard to be read."
17 and suicidal,"Just in case someone I know personally is reading this I won't use my real name so let's just say that my name is Thomas stevely and I'm from the back end of nowhere in the U.K. I am 17 years old and my recent mistakes have lead to bringing my family a lot of pain due entirely to my own stupidity. All my life all I've wanted is to help people but all I seem to be capable of doing is hurting those closest to me which has lead to me struggling to maintain relationships and friendships. This has lead me down a spiralling path of self harm suicidal thoughts. I don't entirely know why I'm even writing this and I don't see how this will help but many people seem to do this and people I have spoken to on various forums have told me that this can help so here it is I guess. I am pretty much at absolute rock bottom right now and now all I can think of is trying to pay for all the pain I have brought to both friends and family but every time I try to think of ways to pay for the harm I have done throughout my life I keep coming back to the same answer which is committing suicide but I know myself and I know that I'm too much of a snivelling, pathetic coward to actually do it. I know that I should really seek professional help but I don't want to become better or to stop blaming myself because I know that I deserve the pain I'm experiencing and if I get help then I'm not paying for the pain I have brought all I want is to be strong enough to simply end this miserable existence I call a life. I'm sorry if that seemed kind of pathetic or whiny but I've never been very good with words. I'm not sure what good I expect to come from posting this but I felt I needed to get it off my chest."
Pills,What's a lethal way to kill yourself with pills or drugs that's relatively easy and not too painful. It's really difficult sorting through information online. Thanks
I dont have anyone in my life.,"Nobody cares, Im living by myself, I hate myself and dont want to live."
Wtf do I do with my life now...,"I really don't know where to start....I met the girl of my dreams 2 years ago she's perfect in every way. Just over a year ago we got together, I lost my job and had to move out in Febuary of this year it'd only been six months but we decided the best option would be for me to move to Norway to live with her full time. (I stayed at hers for a few weeks prior and she stayed at mine for 2 months plus other weekend visits etc)So I uprooted my life, loaded my vehicle with all of my posessions and literally drove for 3 days with all my remaining money etc to Norway from the UK.Since I arrived I've been trying to get work (not easy without knowing the language, although learning that at the same time). It's been hard, I was getting money from the Uk up untill about 2 months ago which was helping. However that too stopped now.Yesterday she sits me down and tells me it's not working out and she wants me to leave... the money stress has been difficult over the months and it's caused her to slowly start resenting me and she no longer loves me and doesn't think those feelings will come back and wants me out now so that I don't use any more money eating food etc. She's given me less than a week.I don't blame her for this I know it's been hard and she's been super good to me it can't have been easy for her.So I'm stuck in Norway with all my clothes, bike, pc and all my other stuff (about a small vans worth) with no money, nowhere to go, completely depressed and devastated that the woman I love more than anything has basically thrown me away. I don't know anyone here apart from her relatives. Even if I somehow manage to sell all my posessions fast then I'll be flying back to the Uk to homelessness and joblessness...I have nothing and noone wtf do id do, Don't wish to sound emo but all I can think in my brain is that the easiest solution is just to overdose and take the easy way out. "
I'd just so love to not wake up.,"I have chronic pain, soon I'll be jobless (which also means homeless). Everything is an act of will. Typing this is painful. I'm just so tired of lying to myself constantly to get through the day. I've attempted suicide multiple times throughout my life. And after each attempt I've done my best to 'recover' and 'crack on'. Here's the truth:
I wish I'd succeeded the very first time. Things haven't gotten better. It's been 20 years since my first attempt and of the two decades since none of any of it has been worth the physical or psychic pain of carrying on. Give me three wishes, and that I'd have succeeded back then is the first."
Count your blessings.,"Its hard to describe it anymore. Everything is dull, every activity seems like a waste, relationships, school, work.. its all a waste of time. I havent been happy in over ten years. Considering i'm twenty two, it seems like an eternity. I remember watching my sister attempt suicide. I remember cleaning up the copious amounts of blood after my parents took her to the hospital, i was ten. My life has been rocky since then, i never went to school, when i did it was to fight someone or generally fuck my education up one way or another. I never went to highschool, i was expelled after a bout with a state trooper in which i punched him in the face. Not soon after, i was on my long road to.. nowhere. i ended up in a juvenile detention center, as im sure you would've assumed. After getting my ass kicked more than a few times, kicking ass a few times, it was time to go. Little did i know, i was heading right into another abyss this world shoves their unwanted problem children. Off i was, to meet new patients, people, as i like to call them. Friends, even.. So here I am, thirteen years old, away from home, abandoned, full of anger, hate, sadness.. i felt abandoned by my family. I just wanted everything to go away, the feelings, the people, the medications.. l just wanted to be normal. How would it feel to go to highschool? would i have had a highschool sweetheart? would i have had friends? would i have even mattered? i never did get the chance to go. One Sunday evening in March if Im not mistaken, i was on a home weekend, i was lying on the floor on my computer, i didnt have a bed or desk, i felt really alone, a glance around my room didnt help, as i realized, nobody needs me. Besides, i had nothing to give. At that moment, i knew..One Seroquel, two, three, not helping..
Four, Five, Six, feeling something,
Seven, Eight, Nine, i didnt want this feeling,
Ten, Eleven, Twelve, its going away!
Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen, all gone.
Soon i started fading in and out of consciousness, the entire ride back to my RTF, I remember wondering if i'd die on that backseat or in my bed that night.. i couldnt finish that thought.. i was out like a light. I woke up two days later, anxious, confused.. then i remembered. Fuck, what kind of asshole can't even off themselves without fucking it up?.. Here I am. Five years later and that goddamn feeling is creeping back up.. i could definitely use a friend."
"i started school and it's been hell for me, i'm honestly debating suicide at this point, i don't know what else to do","ever since i started school my anxiety has just been through the roof, my parents are divorced(i live with my mom), my mom is not financially stable right now, my dad abuses me a shit ton every time i see him, i have no friends on the internet or in real life, i have a bad cutting/self harm problem and i've tried multiple suicide attempts and all of them failed, i really don't want to be at school because i feel so uncomfortable there and my mom won't look into doing online school or homeschool for me which pisses me off even morei hate my life and i feel like all that's left is to just fucking off myself"
I don't have a reason to live anymore,"I've been through so much trying to grow past my abusive upbringing and actually live life, but I'm still as weak and useless as when I started. I can't even imagine anymore that this is a world where happiness could ever happen for me. I don't have any reference experiences of ""meaning"" or ""happiness"" or even ""love"". Not a single person wants to be with me, which is understandable because I can't give even a penny's worth of value or joy to anyone. There is literally no point to my existence. I can't do it anymore."
Fuck Everything.,"I have nothing left to look forward to and nothing to look up to. I can only possibly get 2 GCSE's, one of which I've given up on and the other's useless in life. I have no social life and can't handle people in the slightest. I just curl up on the bench at break with my coat protecting me from the outside world. I wasn't always this way. I've only realised this since March, when my mother committed suicide. The day my entire world came crushing down.I guess I'd better explain what this is about. I've always grown up in poverty. Not just ""We can't afford computers or consoles"" level of poverty, I mean scraping around underneath sofa cushions for 10p's to try and get some bread and milk.But I was happy. It taught me to appreciate what little I had and not to worry about what I didn't have. And that's how things were for the first 15 years of my life.In 2014, not long after we moved house, my mother became friends with a man from down the road and in the summer of last year he invited her out to play Pokemon Go. They admitted that they loved eachother, within a few months he'd moved in and in March they'd sent off marriage forms.So, my mother had a man who loves her, a nearly 18 year old daughter getting ready for uni, a 15 year old trying with his GCSE's, and a 13 year old figuring out what his options'll be. Surely this should be the most exciting time as a parent?Apparently not as on the 10th of March, the day after they sent off the marriage forms, Mum killed herself. She didn't leave a note and didn't say goodbye in any way. She just went out ""to the shop"" and never returned.At that point social were scrambling to figure out what to do with us and the rent situation. But it's alright, we have the fiance to look after us.Come mid April he's decided he doesn't care about us. And instead of giving us a warning, he just packs up and leaves. The first thing we knew about it was social calling my sister to let her know, that she wouldn't be able to look after my 13 year old brother and I and so we'd be put into a foster home. It took a month for us to be moved because my brother and I literally cannot share a room and we had to be near a train station so we could visit my older brother and sister.So I was forced to move 23 miles away to a town I'd never even heard of into a house with upper class cunts who think everyone should be exactly like them who make me pay for literally everything from clothes to the light bulb in my room to pens and pencils myself despite them not letting me look for even a summer job in a cornershop and to a school full of upper-middle class people who've OBVIOUSLY never had to go without anything and look down upon the poor. I had to try and explain to someone in my art class what hunger is and what it feels like!The biggest factors in my final decision are that people live like this while others like my mother kill themselves or even starve to death in Britain because they're barely even earning a quarter of the poverty line,  and that is my future. That's what I have to look forward to.Here's why; I left school at 11 to start helping my mother more because of her depression making things hard for her but I just ended up not having the time for home-ed so I will have no qualifications. I can't be around people, I can't praise myself (so a CV's gonna be impossible) and I'm so fat amateur football clubs turn me down as a goalie despite being better than (or at the very least turning up more consistently than) their starting keeper. The lack of playing made me fatter and sadder because I started comfort eating and now I can't stop.And in the past few weeks I've noticed myself waking in the early hours of the morning with a notebook on my lap, a pen in my hand and another page of the thoughts I keep firmly locked inside my head for the most part, just sprawled across another page. Stuff like ""I am not me. It's all just other people's versions of me"", ""I have lost touch with who I really am"", ""How is life a gift? Answer me that, Christians"", ""People are dying of starvation in Britain while [foster carer's names] stuff their pockets"", ""People like me shouldn't exist"", ""These are the voices I live with 24/7/365! GET THE FUCK OUT OF ME PLEASE"" Ooh, a page here that just says ""FIX ME PLEASE!"", ""Please help me! Please I don't know what to do!"", half a page of ""The end is never the end is never the end is never the end"" just looping (which I swear I've heard somewhere before) followed by half a page of ""I'm scared"" over and over again, ""Don't come near me! I SAID STAY BACK! For your own good! Please help me, mummy"", ""Why am I this way?"" and ""I'll show you! I'll show you all!"" on the same page, and ""I'm not scared anymore. I'm ready for my final dance!"" and that's just the highlights. I swear to the-nonexistent-God I'm not making this up.The only thing that's held me here for so long is the thought of it being my brother to find me lifeless, but now I just don't care. And don't tell me I don't know what's right for me. I've still got about 50-60 years left if I don't end it and that's if I try everything (in vain) to fix my future. I don't want that long in the same poverty I've grown up in. Unlike my mother, I can't make �40 last a week. And I don't care how selfish suicide is. I am selfish.Thanks for reading, even though I know you're rolling your eyes at the thought of yet another depressed teen on here."
and this is the part where i doubt people even more and consider some options on the table,"my mom threatened me that if i don't have anything to do in the long run...i'd be thrown out to some far remote place. . .
and they went back on their word on trying to help me get back into schooli weighed the options and tried a job at a call center where a relative of mine was starting to work... i was able to pass everything but was put on hold since i don't have any proper professional references    i got laughed at by him that i don't know my relatives that very much.... and even mislabeled an in-law of mine for an uncle
when asked if i do have any relatives PAST or currently working on such fields and at the company where i applied to.. then my relatives finally agreed with me that i really was isolated by my parents for far too long since i told the H.R that my friends are long gone and moved to another country, same with professional references... i'm officially cutting all communications with parents once all these problems are fixed, i mean all of their ideas have sent me problems rather than solutions to the original problems they made me go through... a person has his quota when it comes to taking some S*** i was badly hurt when the H.R that asked me IF i do have a proper set of friends....she must be weirded out when i said, ""this must be your first time in seeing an applicant that has no set of friends, since the people i knew went off to other countries and the ones i i recently knew changed contacts and is unable to contact them."" adding insult to injury, i was hurt by my mom when she reversed psychology me and told me ""this is issue where it is your fault, you have a hard time making friends and you don't have friends"" fuck that, i DID have friends and alot of them...but i was forced by my parents to cut off all communications with them and now i am having issues with it in trying to get a job     so "
Cancer?,"Several symptoms of cancer in/on my body, although I wished a couple of years back to get any sickness/disease. Since I was a pussy to hang/cut/fall/die and kill this irrelevant life. The only thing encouraging me to continue is my mediocre music,
Having no funds to afford beats, copyrights and all those fantsy equipment to buy. Well, not really mediocre, but exceptionally well written tbh. Reviews by several people commended and even wanted me to pursue, but I'm too overwhelmed and rather play video games to ease my depression. Sigh. Imma wait until it's stage 4, currently stage 2. Guess I'm an expiring  bomb."
I tried,goodbye
This is it. I am going to kill myself.,It is final.
Feelings coming on strong and not going away,"A year and a half ago, I posted this:
Many things have remained the same since I made that post, one of which is constantly feeling guilty at work, having a suicidal ideation most of the time, and not getting too into making plans for suicide because of the guilt of leaving my parents without children. However, a few weeks back, one of my close friends died in what I think is likely a suicide. She was an only child. Her parents are going to grow old without children at their side. And this has got me thinking, if her parents have to deal with that grief, what makes my parents so special that they should be immune from that pain? I wrote a note in a heap of emotion before the holiday weekend, and even though my emotions have mostly returned to neutral, the words in the note still hold true, and the more and more I think about it, the more it seems to be an objectively acceptable choice. Not sure where I'm going with this, but wanted to post. "
I'm just ready to die,At this point.. I'm 16 I drink heavily ever since Haley left me.. I actually loved her.. but school rumors were spread.. and she had to move.. I moved to Mississippi away from my step dad.. and I let her in.. and her dad took her away.. I haven't been able to hold a relationship since.. I almost died in my sleep because I threw up but I was side ways.. I just want to die.. I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself.. I don't know how I've lasted this long.. but I'm gonna snap within these few months.. every human has a breaking point and mines nearing.. I'll post my moms number when I am going to do it
I'm so trapped and breathing panic. What do I do,"I quit my job to move back in with myparents cause my job had been making my suicidal thoughts worse and worse. But after quitting and talking to them and getting yelled at that I just need to ""get over"" my clinical depression and how theyre gonna put me to work.  I'm just so scared and I have to say goodbye to my friend. They're both military so they dont understand how it feels to really give up on everything, but I have. I dont belong anywhere, I honestly just think I should jump off a bridge. "
What do you think happens when we die?,I'm really just hoping for it to fade to black like The Sopranos did.
"The good times are gone, and it's my fault.","I am a worthless man. I wish I would just die. People smile at me, but they secretly don't care whether they see me again or not. I can't be trusted. I'm a horrible person.I've thought about suicide a lot. If I did, things would be better for everyone.Haven't had a proper meal since last Thursday. Anxiety is starving me. It's what I deserve. "
I just told my mom that I'm taking transgender hormones and that I'm taking a semester off of college. I just don't know right now.,"I haven't been suicidal since high school... I don't even know if I'm suicidal right now, but I'm having the same thoughts right now that I had leading up to me trying to kill myself just about once a week for months three years ago.My mom was so disappointed in me when I told her these things.  I'm pretty sure she things I'm a fuckup, and I kind of feel the same way about myself.  I'm not sure if I'll ever achieve what I want through hormones, and I keep wondering if I should just end everything.I don't want to feel this way.  The thing I hated most about being suicidal in high school was the very real fight against myself leading up to when the suicidal part of me almost won.I don't want to go through that again, but right now I don't know what to do.  I don't know if a way out.  I don't know how I can keep living when I despise myself.  I look in the mirror and all I feel is hatred towards my appearance.  I really truly hate myself and I don't know how to fix this."
being alive this long was a mistake,bye
Hey there,"I'm not depressed and I've never experienced anything particularly tragic or traumatic. My life isn't tough, I just don't enjoy living it.I don't like anyone. I don't enjoy anything. Good night. (I am just going to bed lol it is 3 AM)"
"After much deliberation, I have come the conclusion, that it is time for my life to end. I'm just not pleased with life and feel like ""A man out of place,...out of time."" Just doing a bunch of self renovation won't culminate in a fixed soul. I'm just a empty shell. I tried, very hard and long.","Tried very long and hard to fix myself. None of which was the cure to what illness vexes me.I'm 27, live with my parents, getting government subsidies for mental illness. I get out twice a week with my asshole of a best friend. I weigh about 320 at 5'5"", have a hundred dollars to my name. I used to be A+ certified but let it expire. I have IBS and I'm borderline diabetic. My cholesterol is too damn high. What's the point? I feel like dying would do everyone a favor."
Too much,Everything feels so heavy in this moment. My antidepressants were working!!! For like 6 months! I'm not sure what I did wrong but the past few weeks I've just been getting more and more depressed and suicidal. I swear I haven't missed a dose so I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me?? I'm wondering if I should just quit taking them since clearly something is fucked. Either way I just can't get the static in my head to stop and usually there's a rational voice inside my head telling me not to do anything stupid but I don't hear it right now. I don't know what to do or who to talk to because if I ask a friend for help it'll feel like their help isn't genuine.
I'd rather take my own life than let my father do it,"My father said that if he ever caught me smoking weed or tobacco he'd shoot me. Well he found my pipe, vape, and other stuff so.. I guess this is goodbye. I hear him finding his gun.I want to die with dignity and I'm going to take things into my own hands.Thank you reddit for being the best community I ever joined.Goodbye world.."
Too pussy to pull the trigger,"I'm so stressed out. Everyone puts pressure on me as if they just don't see how stressed I am.
I can't even perform a simple task now. In fact, I don't even have the guts to pull the trigger. I'm just sitting there and having the barrel in my mouth, looking for a chance to die."
I don't think there's someone out there that's capable of truly loving me,"I'm 25, I don't think I'm a terrible looking person, but every relationship I try just fails. I try to be a good person and caring and am accepting of faults, but it doesn't seem like there's someone out there that will accept me and my faults. I have PTSD and am a very anxious person. I really try to have a big offering heart, but it just seems like I scare off everyone dating wise with what I have and it's making me feel so worthless and so unimportant. I just want to feel desired."
I'm sorry,"I have found this subreddit and I have been overwhelmed by the amount of positive support that is given here. Thank you to each and everyone who has spoken to me. You really have helped, but I have to take break from it myself. It has been heartbreaking to start pm people and have them go silent. I fear most if not all I have spoken to are no longer with us.To those here for help I know it is hard... Trust me as someone who nearly threw himself infront of a train. Yes there are people who do understand and they are here. I have been receiving therapy, but the people here have been my support. No therapist or feel good guru will be able to help like those who actually went through hell and back. Please give them a chance, even if you don't believe in yourself, there are total strangers out there that just want you to be happy.Today is heritage day in my country. So I'll be drinking a beer to all of you. I wish good fortune for all that visit here. Both seeking help and those giving it.See you later

I need help ASAP,There is this guy I texted on kik. He had a really generic story of being too emotional and having an abusive mother. He did not send me any scars so I thought he was lying. I had some fun (little virtual seduction using gifs) and then he went all over me that he loves me. And started telling me that he will jump off the roof if I don't reply to him. I told him that I was having fun and that it wasn't serious and continuously told him that it was all virtual. Now I'm having panic attacks of being arrested if he actually kills himself. And I met him on OMEGLE so obviously I thought it was a trap. Is it? Help me!
Cannot get the courage to electrocute myself.,"I walk past an electrical station everyday on my way to work. It is surrounded by an electrical fence, but I figure if I am able to get through the gate, I can touch one of the towers and night night. Last Thursday I decided to get everything else set up before I at least try. I typed out an email to my mom,my sister, and my boss on a word doc, I cleaned my tiny apartment to a shine and sold a bunch of stuff. I was supposed to do it last Friday. I sat next to the plant for nearly three hours and went home defeated. On Sunday I bought my favorite rum, got really drunk but still pussied out. I ended up falling asleep on the street until 4 am and walked home. Now it is midnight and I haven't decided what to do. In the day I feel confident up until I get there and I can not do it. Is it the method that is fucking me up? I am starting to think a gun is better, quicker. I do not want to be left a vegetable for my remaining family to find and be burdened with. What should I do. I am asking because I assume others on this subreddit are contemplating suicide and might have some insight. (P.S I own only a .22 rifle, is this enough to kill? I am not experienced with guns and it seems just too small.)"
I really dont understand why im suicidal,"My life is great. I got into the university i applied for. I have made a bunch of new friends and i even have someone that really fancies me. Yet the only thing i want is to end it all. I want to drop out of uni and just do nothing for the rest of my short life. I have already skipped a week of lectures just to be able to lay there and not having to think about anything.I have never considered suicide as a good option before recently, and i dont understand why. "
Couple failed attempts. Exit bag planned. Long read.,"I don't know where to start...My dad died suddenly when I was 19. We'd had a few rocky years like I'm sure a lot of people have, but thankfully the last few months before he died we'd reconciled. It still hurts 21 years later. Not a day goes by where I don't wish he was here. For a long time I dreamt about him. We would be at a baseball game together, he would say he was going to get some hotdogs for us and start up the stairs. The vendor would come by, I'd turn and yell to him. He would look back at me and keep walking. He'd never return. I had that dream 2-5 time a year for quite a few years until recently. I had a messy divorce at 30. Apparently I was drunk and got violent one night. No recollection of the event. Was arrested for felony evading with a vehicle. Ex was kind hearted and did not pursue charges for DV. Wrote the judge explaining I was (am), suffering from mental illness, and preferred treatment over jail. I did 2 years of probation, paid some fines, and moved on. A year later, I met a girl who I fell instantaneously, deeply, and madly in love with. We had great chemistry, and about a year later ended up pregnant and married. My love for her,and our new son grew daily. I still suffered from depression, but it wasn't caused by her. We moved, had some additional stresses, and she told me she wanted to divorce. We reconciled after a few tough months, did some therapy together, patched it up and moved on. Bought a house, got better jobs, had a daughter. 5 years later she's filed for divorce, and is proceeding with it this time. Counseling not an option, doesn't want to work on things, determined to be divorced. She states she hasn't been happy for years, and that we've become different people who are better apart. I don't feel like any of that is true, but she will not change her mind. I certainly played my part over the last few years, losing the balance between work and home, not getting some help with the stress of life, finances, etc. Nothing people haven't gone through, and come out of before. To say I am beyond devastated would be a massive improvement. I tried living with some friends, that didn't help. It led me to my first attempt. I had read a bunch of forums, and blogs, and decided I wanted to go peacefully and ""in tact"". I didn't want to burden my friends with the clean up, or trauma of doing it in their home. I sat in my car and slit both my wrists - the long way, not the help me way. It was a lot harder even with a very sharp knife than I thought, but I did manage a bit of blood out one of them. However, I came to realize why the warm bath is needed. To keep the body from doing its thing, and the blood congealing. So, I was found by my friend and taken involuntarily to a hospital by police. In the hospital, I tried twice to asphyxiate myself, with no luck. Something about them wanting people to ""get better"". I was prescribed some additional meds, dosages changed, reluctantly released after 9 days, and now sent 1500 miles away to live with relatives, and get ""healed up"", work on myself. I haven't seen the kids in 3 weeks, minimal contact from my wife. Seemingly very little concern, but whatever. My kids are almost 9, and 4.5 years old. I cherish them more than anything. I grew up with divorced parents, and step parents on both sides. I still to this day have resentment and hatred for my step mother. I blame her for the relationship between my father and I deteriorating. The thought of another man holding my daughter, playing with my son, any involvement whatsoever makes my heart race, and my body flash with intense heat. Nevermind with my wife. The few times I had seen them after we separated was not a happy time for me. Instead, I was miserable, and hurt, and reminded that we were not a unit anymore. Unable to enjoy their company. My kids get what's going on, and we always cried when I left to go to my new home. My daughter wonders when I will come back to her home. It tears me up thinking about it. I've been wishing, and hoping for an accident, a heart attack, crazy gun wielding psycho for a few weeks. No luck. Pills seem messy and hit or miss at best, gun or jumping is out, again, due to the idea of wanting to be ""in tact"". Then I stumbled upon the exit bag/helium method. I'm planning on doing that sometime in the near future. The bag can be easily made, I can get a tank of helium and a hose for $20, and then, it's about finding a place/time to do it. Go to sleep basically. I know my wife will be devastated, as will the kids, and the rest of my family, but I really feel like leaving now is better than what I know the future will be like. It's unbearable to me. Missing out on the daily routines, split holidays, child support, not coming home to them rushing me at the door saying ""daddy""!! That was always the prize at the end of the day. I'm not looking for support, or empathy, or to be talked down. I just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere. "
"Me again, about to climb the internet reception tower near my home.","I havent slept in days, can't even remember what I was going to say. I'll update when i get to the topedit 1: Walking there now, my reasons. Chronic Depersonalization/derealization disorder that I will be left with for the rest of my life and a multitude of other reasons"
[AMA] It's my suicide birthday,"I'm committing suicide today (in approximately 17hrs, today is also my birthday.  Ask me anything."
"I'm such a bad person, and I want to change but I can't.","I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but since I do mention suicide I've decided to post this here.
I told my mom that I wanted to see a therapist back in February and she still yet has to make an appointment with one. I don't think she wants me to get help. I asked her to do this many times, just to get the same answer over and over: I will call them tomorrow/ (day of the week). I think I should just give up all hope on getting the help I need. I don't even know how I managed to stay that hopeful for so long.
There are days where I feel so motivated and have so much energy. I feel like I could do anything, such as become the world's greatest dog trainer, or one of the best magicians, or other dumb things like that. I get so much done on days like that. I clean, I talk to new people, and share my crazy ideas and plans. Then days where I feel so frustrated and depressed. I end up taking my anger out of my family, beating myself up, questioning my identity, and thinking about suicide. It's exhausting.
I do so many impulsive things and regret them later. I made so many friends last year, but cut all contact with a group of them when they didn't message me first. I broke two phones because the person I was calling didn't pick up. I adopted two cats knowing I can't be there for them all the time. (I have two cats at my mom's, and the other two cats I adopted live at my dad's. (Dad is almost never home because of his job.)) I tried to fail a certain class because my friend was going to fail and I didn't want them to be lonely. I dropped band class because the teacher told me to practice my instrument more. I stopped going to high school and joined the homeschooling program to finish my education early when I don't have a reason to. I could go on and on about all the stupid things I've done impulsively but this post would be way to long.
I'm selfish and deluded. I hate who I am. I drink Dr. Pepper to cope, go ahead and laugh at me for that but I'm being serious. My teeth are terrible because of all the soda I drink. At this point, I feel like dying is the only way out. Hopefully the cold I currently have will worsen and I will die that way."
"The preparations are ready, can't hold strong for much longer.","I said i was gonna kill myself by 18 if i hadn't had a relationship by then, and, even tho i haven't gone trough with it, it feels like i have been slowly killling myself ever since that day. For the last 6 years i have been isolating myself, ruining all my friendships, ruining all my family bonds, becoming worthless and, now that i know nobody is gonna miss me, i feel ready to go trough with it. No bullshit, knife trough the heart, maybe some alcohol to numb the pain but that's it, probably the 27th. Mom i'm sorry. "
I need everything to stop,"Hello, it's me again. I made a post about three weeks ago saying that i was giving life another chance, but if it didn't work out, i'd attempt on the 11th. Well, look where i am now - tried to kill myself under a bridge and ended up having to go to the hospital. Been kept out of school and have had my parents anxiously looking over my shoulder these past two weeks, and honestly, i wish i had just died right there. Nothings gotten better. My friends hate me now - they blame me for everything when really, it wasn't their drama to begin with. Meddlers gonna meddle i guess. And my ex, well, he can go straight to hell. Maybe i'll see him there when i die.Honestly though, my attempt may have scared me off for a little while but i doubt that i'll live out to see Halloween. Or rather, i don't exactly want to. It's not like it would be a spur of the moment decision - i have a note, and little individual messages written for the fuckers who made everything worse. So i guess i'm just waiting for another reason to go. Why stay alive when everything has gone to shit?"
I'm beginning to move towards ending everything.,"I've finally given up hoping that things will ever get better. I've been trying and fighting for a decade now, and I'm too tired and things keep failing anyway.So, I'm starting to get rid of my possessions, push away my friends and family, etc. Doing my best to do it slowly so no one really notices. I imagine it will take a few months at least. Which is fine, I need to figure out how to get money together to get the things I need anyway. I don't really know why I'm bother to write any of this here. Part of me probably doesn't want to die yet and is still trying to find some comfort or hope. I don't know. I just want to stop existing. There's no point to it anymore."
This week might be it,"I've been thinking very seriously about doing it for the past month or so but I think this might finally be it. Maybe even tomorrow. I've started looking at every interaction I have through that context, I've been thinking about what I want to do on my last day, all of these things. I'm just really tired and really ready. I'm making peace with it. A week ago I set myself up at a clinic for therapy and I'm still waiting to get assigned to a therapist but on Monday I might try to go in and talk to their on-call therapist like they told me I could. I'm just worried that I'll be hospitalized, I'm totally uninsured and can't afford that. That was one of the only things keeping me from trying to kill myself too- I don't have a way to do it that will 100% work and I can't fail again and be in the hospital again. Maybe me talking to them means I don't really want to do it. The thing about therapy is I've been in and out for ten years now, since I was ten years old! And it's just going to be the same thing over and over again! Because there's something really wrong with me apparently. Maybe I just don't want to get better bad enough, I know it's my fault.I kind of just want to tell someone. My roommates have no idea anything is going on but I can't talk to them. I keep thinking about their reactions. I just want someone to know that this might really be it for me.This is as far as my life was supposed to go and I've been in the process of accepting that for a year. I'm making peace with it. I just realised that it makes me happy to think about how I'm almost done, how hopefully this is the end, and that's something that I can't remember ever feeling with my ideation or previous attempts and that feels really significant I guess. I'm just done"
"Feeling so low. I don�۪t know what to do, and I needed to reach out. (16F)",You can PM me too if you want. Writing can help you structure your thoughts :)
Either way im a burden,"On mobile so sorry for the shit formatting in the upcoming wall of text. Killing myself would implode every kind of structure around me. My girlfriend is not mentally stable enough to go on after i kill myself and would probably meet the same fate. My mom would absolutely kill herself if i did (im the only child to a teen mom her world kinda revolves around me). They know im suicidal which only makes it worse bc i feel guilty that my life is ""good"" by all accounts yet i still dont have a reason to live. I make everyone around me misserable bc they cant help me. Ive never had any goals in life. Ive hated school since i was little and now in my 3rd year of uni its the worst its ever been. My ideal life would be a life where i dont do anything. Literally. If i could be a stay at home dad without a child tp take care of my life would be happy. Or whatever the guy version of a trophy wife/ sugar momma is. Everything ive ever been good at is bc its been easy. Anything i actually enjoy doing im bad at which eventually makes me hate it. The only thing ive ever been good at is videogames and its not like im going to be a pro gamer any time soon or do anything meaningful with that ""talent"". Even the enjoyment in that is starting to fade. I'm completely hopeless. Im here counting down the days until i stop caring enough about my mom or gf to let them be my only will to live. In the meantime ive stoped giving a fuck about every other facet of my life. I basically just exist and existence is bullshit. The concept of death feels like it would be a blessing. Im certain suicide is the option for me and know ill go through with it one day. Just not yet. until i decide when i want to die i play overwatch on XB1 alot. Its basically the only thing that will make me just kinda numb and focus on that instead of ny shitty existence. If anyone would like to lobby and talk cool. If not thats fine too i dont really expect anyone to give a shit."
Why am i suicidal?,"I have no reason to be suicidal, i just am. It has never been so tempting to just cut my wrists and end it all"
What will happen if I tell my school I don't want to go home because of home life?,I'm 15 and from the UK. I won't go in details but lets just say everytime I go home I feel as though the gap between my suicidal thoughts and actually commiting suicide gets closer and closer. I live with my mum and several siblings.
Valete Omnes,"Goodbye all. At least that's what I want to say. I'm not posting here for advice or sympathy. My whole life I've been looked at with pity and sympathy like I am a broken human being. While that may be true, I'm not seeking attention, more that I need to put my thoughts and feelings into words, and at least know one person read it.
I want to die every day. Often, I day dream of the different ways of killing myself, and I'd say almost once a week I find myself with a noose around my neck.
So why haven't I killed myself?
Because I have a fianc̩ that loves me more than anything in the world, as well as two beautiful dogs, one a puppy that I've been raising since she was 7 weeks old.
Not even the three most important things in the world can make me happy, but I stay alive because I can't bare to think of what will happen to them if I committed suicide.
Having lost my mother to an OD at a young age, and my brother to suicide a few years later, I'm no stranger to tragedy, and I know how much it can ruin a person.
I truly care about my S/O more than anything in the world. But, my hatred for living, and myself, has become stronger than my love for them I fear.
Not that I don't love him and my pups, but at this point, my mental illness seems to have made this relationship kind of impossible. It has always seemed inevitable to me that I will end up killing myself one way or another.  I wish so badly I could finally just do it. I'm such a fucking coward, I want to just end it so I don't have to exist anymore. I have no joy anymore. It's either constantly on the verge of having an anxiety attack at work, or laying in bed crying because I can't find anything that brings me happiness anymore.
I think I might do it today. One can only hope. "
Im having a panic attack please can somebody talk to me?,Sure! What�۪s going on?
Why shouldn't i end my life,"Well.. i am currently in a state of perplexed confusion right now as what to do with my life. I hope to begin to explain my predicament in hope someone has a reasonable solution as the steps i can take to be better i guess for a lack of a better word. So first of all, my life is terrible. always has and looks like it always will be, first of all i have a condition called trimethylaminuria which is essentially a a chronic body odour chugging genetic condition which allows for ridicule and humiliation on an everyday bases as the condition forces me to smell like a hot steaming pile of garbage regardless of showers or baths, i have had this condition for almost 2 years and have lost friends of 10+ years because of it and has forced me to become a troll like figure hiding away in my room from the world. oh and it is extremely rare and uncurable. This would be enough for suicide for some people but unfortunately my misfortunes sadly don't end there as i also have a condition called pectus carinatum which is a chest deformity which causes the sternum to be pushed out in a very visible way, which has done a great deal to my self esteem i can assure you since the age of 13/14. These conditions both howether pale in  the suffering caused by this third curse, in which i have obtained huge TERRIBLE looking scars that i have ever seen even with the searching on the internet which cover at least 55% of my penis from  the base to the tip in which i have absolutely no recollection of its emergence into my life which is a nice mystery for me to investigate in my spare time. Along with a lifetime of bullying in school for my race,body,shoes,wealth and name by children and certain teachers alike i have also been persecuted all my life by my mother who also had blamed me for the abandonment of my father at the age of 7 directly to my face, A memory i would like to forget if possible, and of course my gambling addiction had manifested itself in order to perhaps accumulate wealth in order to try plaster the abyss known as my self worth bu unfortunately has only concluded in a loss of thousands of pounds and has not been as helpful as i had once thought. I am also 19 years of age btw and i apologise for the wording and structure of this writing as im kinda not okayy."
Throwing in the towel,"Thanks for the support you've all given me from time to time. However, this is inevitable. I can't keep living like this, and hoping some stranger will give me advice or pointers on why I should stay alive. I'm 100% meaningless to others I know personally unless my meaning is to be a pedestal for them to stand on. I'm 25.
I have no genuine friends, and never have.
The person I'm in a relationship with I'm pretty sure is only in it for sex.
The only thing my mother likes about me is my dog and the money I give her.I've battled an alcohol addiction that I concurred hoping it would improve my depression. It didn't. Sobriety has only made me more aware of how pointless I am. Even when it comes to the workplace I'm consistently getting swept under the rug. My questions go ignored, and anything I say is treated as though it wasn't even heard. I often feel like I don't exist, so I figure why should I continue to. Much love, and gratitude to you all."
Why shouldn't I just end my life?,"I'm just using a burner account, and I'm sorry. I've been thinking of suicide for about 1-2 years now. I have been thinking that I'd be okay with dying. I don't have a love interest going for me, no job, no responsibilities.I have only 2 friends really, both seem to have a lot going for their lives, like jobs, love interests, academic success. I've always been the loser of the group, or really, a loser in general. Physically I'm disproportionate, I have a sharp face and really skinny body that makes me unattractive/ugly and undateable, trust me I've tried for 2 years with as much confidence as possible. I can't hold a simple job, I panick and mess everything up. Academically I've had minimum success, and other people often use me to their advantage. I lie to other people to cover how boring and uninteresting I am, and I put a fake smile on everyday to hide how worthless of a person I am. Any pride from even the smallest achievements have been overseen or overshadowed, like anything I ever do is worthless.The only thing thats been keeping me going is the thought of my family. However, my family has lost a lot of people before, and they've often moved on quickly, I wouldn't be any different really. Even if killing myself hurts my family, it wouldn't affect me in the afterlife (I know that sounds selfish, but I'm hurting and it stopped bothering me). People always say to me look to the future, but all I see in my future is bleakness, boring, unsucessful and unfilfilling life. The future doesn't even look like its worth seeing, nothing interests me. My life is boring and has no meaning, and I just want it to be over. I could just end my life, and nobody would bat an eye, at this point I don't see a reason why not. Im not loved, and I don't think I ever will be. "
It feels inevitable...,"Am I suicidal right at this moment... No. The drinking helps. The two packs a day helps. The music helps because it fills me with such a black rage, a profound sadness, that I'm almost immobile... No one notices I think. I seem functional, though I get the occasional ""what's wrong?"" Questions.I have been dwelling a lot on the philosophical notions of meaninglessness. My thoughts put into words, my deepest intuitions explained.My life is meaningless, having children was cruel because I cannot be there for them like they'll need me to be, my marriage is a exercise in futility and spite and resentment. I regret not leaving for love and staying out of obligation.I feel like my end is inevitable, everyday I'm a little closer, I'm a little sadder, I'm a little more convinced that I'm right and nonexistence is preferable to pain. It won't be the first time, I've suffered severe alcohol poisoning twice. Almost died once. Maybe next time I'll get it right. I'll walk into the trees behind my house with a few bottles of bourbon and a notebook.My assessment of my life and everyone and everything in it: fuck it, fuck them, fuck this life. I don't see the point and without some sort of purpose what am I even doing here. It is self-torture."
Tried and failed to kill myself last week...,And I feel so much worse. I'm to tried to do anything and I feel like even more of a failure. Things just keep getting worse and I want it all to stop.
��\_(���)_/��,"Been off zoloft for 2 weeks and I don't miss feeling like this. Only thing holding me back from relapsing and cutting is I don't want to deal with the mess afterwards. I really want to kill myself. I don't feel like I'm worth anything, or ever will be. I don't know what I want in life and I won't really amount to much. What's even the point in living when you're this miserable? I'm tired of always falling back into my depression. It's such a safe spot for me because I push everyone out in fear of them hurting me, and hurt myself in the process. I'm just tired of everything. I really do not wanna keep trying."
"Does it ever stop hurting? Day in day out for 8 years, my resilience is thining and death is on my mind.",I don't know if it will ever stop hurting. Sometimes it hurts more but there are times when it hurts less too. I hope you'll hang in there. Hugs
A Bad Day Away,"I really don't like talking about these things, but I need help. I feel like I am a bad day away from killing myself. Right now I mostly fantasize about either slitting my wrists or popping pills. It is sick, and I think about suicide more than anything else, more than girls, my future, having fun...My thoughts have been consumed by suicide. I am 17 (almost 18) and a Senior in High School. I have been slipping recently and I am fucking terrified I am about to relapse. Luckily I made a point to cut all the druggies out of my life, but It's not like it is hard to get whatever I want. I just got a new case manager, and I have no idea how to talk to her. I was finally about to drop this on my old one after a year of meetings, it took me awhile to get comfortable. But now she has been transferred. I still see her, but I have no idea how to talk to her. I go to group therapy, but talking about my issues don't seem to help. I guess it is nice knowing people who understand. But I am not one to express these things. I don't want to be someone's problem. I have a reputation for being nice and hardworking, and I know I have people who look up to me. I don't want to disappoint them. I just want to get to point where I am not struggling to survive. I can feel the self destruction inside me, I don't know how to explain it. What do I do? How do I be happy? How the fuck do people actually feel good about themselves? "
At the brink of a breakup and feel like I don't have any reason to continue living,"All I can think about is how it's gonna be like not having him by my side, not being able to hug him or hold his hand, or take care of him when he's sick, or have crazy adventures and amazing discussions again. And I can't bear to live in a world like that.I also think that if it's hard for him to break up with me but he wants to, then isn't killing myself the best way? He'll be free from me forever and I don't have to deal with the pain of losing him.I need help, I need someone to talk to. I'm so broken right now. All i wanna do is curl up in his arms and listen to his voice. But I can't because I need to give him space to think. Fuck."
whats the point on being alive?,if there are no motivations? no dreams? no friends? no family?
I just don't know if i can do this,"im literally sanding right here with the pills, and i want to, but no matter how hard i try, i lose the nerve and i cant and i dont know what to do and im confused and i need helpUPDATE: So, first thing first. I'm alive. And I'm happy to be alive. I've always considered suicide as a ""second option"" and I guess drunk me (I was drunk when I made this post and took those pills) decided it was the only option for me. I woke up at around 1 am in a pool of vomit in the bathroom. I guess drunk me took  advice and forced myself to vomit (in which case, he may have legit saved my life). Anyways, I'm so, so, so, sorry for worrying you guys. Now I know what sub I need to come to if I need to talk with someone or if something like this happens again. I told my roommate about this whole situation and he and I are planning to book a therapist or something. This is my first real suicide attempt, so I don't want this to happen again to me. I'm sorry for making you guys worry, but now I know who to talk to if things like this happen."
I've come to realize that the only thing really keeping me alive is my mother,"I'm a grown man yet the only thing that's prevented me from actually going through with anything is my mother. More specifically the fact that my mother is physically disabled, can't take care of herself, and the fact that my father is dead and I'm helping care for her. If I died I'd be condemning her to insanity and who knows what other horrors.I know I can't leave her like that but being miserable is still no way to live."
I was offered a new job today,"Someone offered me a new job today.I don't know if I would take it. I don't know enough details yet. But all I can think about is the guilt that I might take it and not be around long enough to make me worth hiring.I don't need it. I have a good job, for all that it matters. The me that thinks I should keep trying wants to give it a chance. The rest of me says ""don't do it, you already have a plan""Why do I do this? I'm not happy. I'm not doing anything to fix it. I don't want to be excited about a change when I'm just going to end up in the same place. I'm just going to disappoint myself. Am I going to live my whole life hoping it will get better, while I spend every day trying to destroy myself?Maybe I'll take the job. It won't matter who I disappoint when I'm gone.I don't want it. What good is a job and money if everyone just wants to take it from you? Or expects you to do something good with it? I would have been happy when I was poor if I didn't have to be alone. Now I'm not poor and my only goal is the end.I just want to throw it all away. Give someone else a chance. Spend it all so that the people who don't care will leave me alone because I have nothing left. But I won't. Because without the good job and the nice house, I'm nothing. Less than nothing.I'm sorry. Sorry for who I've been. For for who I can't be. Sorry for being entitled and lazy and so unhappy with everything. I don't deserve this and so many people that deserve better get nothing.I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I should get rid of all my crap so I don't leave a chore for someone else when I'm gone. But even that seems to be more effort than I can manage. A burden either way."
yeah i'm done,i'm just gonna get it over with after this weekend.fuck this.kind of a goodbye to everyone. it's been real. but i'm done.i'm tired of this. i feel nothing.
Best way to start counselling?,I have my first counselor session with a brand new counselor soon and I'm not sure if I should go in and say everything from how my mother abandoned me to how I have already planned my suicide in one go or if I should build up to it. How do I go about it?
I could use someone; anyone.,"I never know how to start these things. I'm not very good at speaking my emotions or my past. But allow me to start at the beginning. I was 10 when my parents split up. My father was an alcoholic. I'd go over to his home on the weekends. He was abusive when he was drunk, so constantly. He verbally and physically harm me. My mother met a guy, they soon moved in. We were like a family. Me, my 2 brothers, my half sister, my mother, and her boyfriend. He was abusive. Very abusive. I never got a break. After being abused by my step dad on the weekdays, I'd go to my alcoholic fathers house and get abused there. Now, fast forward to me being 11. The abuse was still going on. To get away from it, I'd stay at my cousins house. She was my age and was my best friend. I loved her more than anything. One night, around 7 PM, her father demanded she go to her room and sleep. I thought it was odd that he didn't make us both go. He made me stay. You probably know where this is going. He sat me down and explained what uncles and nieces do when they love each other. Keep in mind I was 11 and confused. He then gave me apple juice, which tasted very funny. He told me to drink it all as it would be a waste if I hadn't. I remember specifically looking at the clock and it reading 7:43 PM and feeling light headed. He guided me to his bedroom and upon looking around, I noticed a pile of white socks on the vanity. There was an obvious camera hidden in them. He demanded I undress myself then to lay on the bed. Yes, he raped me. I play this moment in my head so many times. Looking in the mirror on the vanity and seeing him on top of me; the look on my face. I was terrified, scared, and frozen. It felt like the room was spinning. After what seemed like an eternity, he was done. He told me to put my clothes on and as I was doing so, in his words he said, ""Don't tell anyone about our secret, you slut"".
Months go by until realizing I wasn't his only special friend. His daughter, my sister, my brother, and finally, his baby niece. He's gone to prison for this. But he was only charged with raping his daughter. In prison he threatened me for telling my mother. He was released last year. After the news of my uncle molesting me came out, my father was disgusted in me. He said that it was hard to look at me. He never let me in his house again. My fathers last words to me were ""I never wanted you, just die already"". I haven't seen him to this day. He has a new family. He was my hero, my everything. I love you, Dad. Since I no longer saw my father, I was with my mother during the weekdays and weekends. She was busy providing for us by working constantly. Her husband was a semi delivery guy, so he was hardly home. I was left with my brothers. Any chance they got to sexually touch me, they took it. One of them demanded sexual favors or they would tell my mother that I've done something bad, resulting in me getting an even worse beating from my step dad when he got home. I couldn't do that. So I let my brother(s) have their way. During all of this, I met someone. Sounds a little young to be dating, yes. But it wasn't anything sexual. He was really kind to me. He's still my best friend to this day. We dated for 2 years until I left him. He introduced me to his cousin, who was our age. Me being dumb and young, I started dating him instead. After 2 years of sexual/mental/physical abuse, he left me. I felt incredibly lost without him. I didn't want to be alone. The first guy, being the sweetheart he is, was there for me. I was too scared to be in another relationship so I turned him away. I regret leaving him to this day. He's my best friend that I've always been secretly in love with. I stopped dating for some long years. Fast forward to me being 15. My mother started noticing my depression. It was becoming difficult to cover up. After a scary overdose she decided I needed to start over. She moved me from Indiana all the way to Florida. I've never been to Florida before I lived here. God bless her, she thought it would do more good than harm. I isolated myself. 3 years I was alone. I hadn't hung out with a friend in 3 full years. After many failed suicides and antidepressant medication, I found hope within myself. I was starting to become better, 'happier'. I was doing so great; but then my grandmother fell ill. She passed in June of last year. I felt incredibly lost. I loved her. I looked up to her and seemed advice from her. She was no longer with me. That set me back so far. I isolated myself again. I started experimenting around with self harm. I oddly found so much comfort in it. I overdosed on depression medication (ironic, I know). After I recovered I decided I had to do something with my life. I met a guy in march of this year. I became attached. He was into me. It was going well until he broke it off. After a month of no contact and sleepless nights of crying, he unexpectedly showed up at my house. He begged for me back. I said yes. He only wanted to be my FWB, and if he was still interested in me, he'd turn it into a relationship. I'm not dumb. I know he was using me. But I didn't want to be alone. After being isolated by myself for 3 years and then feeling what it's like to not be alone, I couldn't go back to it. I just couldn't. It was hell to me. We were FWB for a long while and I thought it was going so well. I had my life together. I was looking for a job, getting my license, and things were starting to look up. But then, last week he called me. He told me he just wants to be friends and get to know each other and then hopefully progress into a relationship. That made me anxious. He didn't want to do anything sexual with me. I couldn't read him at all. He came over today. We watched anime together. He then came onto me and sexual things did happen. Of course I didn't reject it, I didn't want to upset him or lose him in any way. After everything was done, he told me ""we have to stop doing this, we need to just be friends"". Which made me feel guilty and ashamed, even though he came onto me. I'm afraid of losing him. He's the only person I have in my life right now. He's the only one I've seen in 3 years. I'm afraid to be alone again. I don't want to go back to that dark place. I honestly can't do this anymore. I hope I will get better, but at the same time I hope I give up so I won't have to fight anymore. I have severe depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, and insomnia. Having one of those is horrendous. Having them all at the same time is hell. I'm writing this after taking a bunch of mixed pills. I'm laying in my bathtub, deciding whether to fill it up with warm water, or just lay here in the cold. All of my suicide attempts were in-the-moment type scenarios. This is one. I'm not scared of death, it's the dying that I'm terrified of.Goodnight everyone, and may your lives be as bright as your dreams. "
Killing myself either tonight or tomorrow,"I can't deal with school, my parents constantly yelling at me, the idea that my girls going to leave me because I have no way of communicating with her anymore because my parents have my phone, and the fact that I have no future. I'm sorry to whoever is reading this but I'm DONE I just cant take it anymore"
I'd be Happier if There Were an Easy Way Out...Just in Case,"I have attempted suicide before and looked up how on the internet and it seems there no painless way to do it. I think it should be legal to do it so there's a way to go peacefully.I'm not quite suicidal. It's partially for the reasons I've listed above and also because I have some hope left, but the outlook doesn't look good.I've had Lyme disease for the past 20 years and I'm almost 40. I live with my parents. I'm also transgender, but I can't do anything about it because my parents don't support me. And this has brought up other issues with my parents that go all the way back to my childhood. I'm too tired to type any more, but if you check my comment history you'll see more details of my situation.So basically I'm in a limbo state it feels like. I can't die and I can't live. If I failed an attempt then maybe I'd get sent to a mental hospital which would be hell compared to this. But that's what I mean about having an easy way out. Things are bad, but they can get much worse and I want to be prepared for that rather than live the last weeks, months, or even years in horrible agony."
I really want a therapist to just sort the things out that I have going on in my mind..but they are so expensive that it's not worth it_��_,"Hey, I'm sorry that the financial investment in therapy makes that a tough option for you right now. I'm glad you've reached out here though, and I'd love to talk about things if you want to. What are some of the things going on in your mind?"
It was so cold last night.,"I figured I would not wake up. But I did. And I was sad. But I know that soon I will close my eyes and I won't wake up. I'm so glad for that that I don't even feel sad about not dying last night. Bad things don't bother me anymore. It rained and all my food got wet. I can't get anymore until Monday, but that's okay. Now, when bad things happen to me, it just means I'm closer to death. This is the first time I can remember that I've felt good. Just thought I'd share that with all of you."
I don't fucking need to be here.,"Fuck this bullshit of a fucking life... I am just doing nothing wasting time for every fucking person that knows me. I am a horrible person, and I am just as useless. I suck at literally everything. There is not a single reason I should be alive. So fuck it.
There must be something to killing myself if I tried it already and I still think it's the best option. I don't even care anymore if I hurt anyone with it. This is just bullshit that is not worth it. "
"I want to die, but know I'll only get in my own way of doing it.","Quite honestly I feel like that's more or less the story of my life when it comes to doing anything. Making friends? Social anxiety's got me covered. Making something of myself? Depression and scatterbrain forgetfulness will help me keep my motivation down and in my fucking place.It goes without saying for how badly I want to die. I've wanted to die this badly for years now, only able to ignore when I can both have something to distract myself and my own brain decides it wants to give me a fucking break with feeling absolutely miserable. Somehow I had it in my head that being at college would help -- force me into an environment where I could try something different. Be around people my age and hopefully learn how to be a human being that can laugh, drink, screw and enjoy other people's company.But of course that's not happening.Instead I've only dug myself into a deeper ditch where I can watch other people my age having friends, laughing, enjoying one's company while I sit here like a fucking statue watching them and constantly being reminded that I will never have the things that they have to make life worth living.And if I can't find life worth living, then what's the point of even trying? If anything, merely existing brings people down more than it lifts people up with how goddamned socially awkward I am -- not even getting started on other shit that's wrong with me.So yeah I want to kill myself, but at the same time, I know how pointless it to want it because somehow I can't help but think it's going to be yet another thing I cannot have. That I'll sabotage it, or some fucked up God in this world will lay the cards out to ensure I fail or chicken out at the last minute. I can see myself sticking a gun in my mouth and I fantasize about having the balls to pull the trigger before getting frustrated when I know that I don't have the balls and will never have the balls and just chicken out at the last second.It's at that moment when I go ahead and let that single instance in my head fade away that I feel truly trapped. Like I don't have any sort of escape unless someone kills me against my own will. Something I can't help but doubt happening because of how goddamned ""lucky"" I seem to be -- always feeling at the bottom of life, but always being just out of reach of happiness or prosperity for that tease to simply exist.Sorry if this rambling mess doesn't make any fucking sense, but the TL;DR I guess is that I fucking hate living and I fucking hate myself for not having the resolve to just end my life. At least then I could pretend in that instance that I had something."
I am tired of surviving,"I don't feel like I have really lived this year. I've just survived. When my husband lost his job, we survived. When my baby didn't have a heartbeat anymore, we just survived. When my FIL got diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, we survived. It's all we have done.But now, my due date is a month away. And I don't think I can survive anymore. I really don't. Everyday, it hurts. I should be getting ready for being a mom and instead, I'm laying in bed imagining ways to hurt myself. I have to see my friends get ready to have their babies and hate that it's not me.I just can't any more. I hate not being pregnant. I hate not being a mom. I hate that my baby is dead. I hate that my body failed me.And I hate that I have to be strong. My husband is watching his farther die. I can't give him more to worry about. So I haven't said anything to him about this.I haven't told me that I've relapsed back into my eating disorder. It's so bad. My throat aches, my voice is going out, my chest hurts. But I can't stop purging. I know it's killing me and I can't stop.And I want to self harm. I can't because it would kill my husband, but I want to just carve out all the bad stuff. I just want to die. I want to stop hurting so much all the time. I want to stop surviving. He's gone this week and I am so close to just ending it. I'm not living anymore. I'm just surviving. What's the point? I hate myself for even considering it, but this isn't a life. "
Update: tried to hang myself last night and the rope came undone last second. Still here. I called my friend in hysterics. Stayed at her house. Came home today told my husband and he's not phased at all. He actually went to sleep a little bit ago.,"Since your friend is supportive, you stay with them for awhile? Emotional support is really important."
I'm scared I'm finally going to kill myself.,"That's it. I'm scared I'm going to do it. I still make throwaways when I post here because I'm scared about someone finding out who I really am but now there's a part of me that hopes someone does. I've given up on life. After 7 years waiting for ""it to get better"" I'm drained. I feel empty. Sure there are short periods where I feel ok, but pushing my way through every day with a feeling of complete worthlessness has depleted me. I used to say the only thing keeping me from killing myself was my old dog and best friend. He's been dead for 6 months and 5 days now. I'm scared."
I'm just tired,"I'm tired of pretending I'm happy every day.
I'm tired of trying to be friends with flakey people who only care about having the most exciting time possible, rather than experiencing actual human connection.
I'm tired of going on endless first dates, only to be ghosted immediately after.
I'm tired of putting in countless hours of work that'll amount to nothing when I'm gone.
I'm tired of fucking everything and there's nothing I can do to stop feeling this way.
I'm tired of trying, it's been more than 6 years and it feels like this depression is here to stay. I can't kill myself, it would be too selfish to the people that really do care about me... It feels like I'm a hollow shell just drifting through life hoping someday things will be better. I know change comes from within, I know things won't be better for me till I make the ""choice"" of happiness. But that's just more fucking pretending. When will the stigma of depression end? Once enough of us have killed ourselves? My life is a lie and I just don't know what to do. "
I'm a worthless waste of everyone's time,"Never should have been born and I never had a fucking chance. I feel like I've been standing still for years while everyone else moves around me and improves their lives or at least does something to make themselves happy. I can't climb out of this financial hole and I can't improve myself, I can barely do anything on my own because I'm human garbage. I'm stuck in a relationship that I don't think I want, he doesn't even have sex with me; the only time I get attention is when I'm sexually harassed by strangers. People I thought were friends just wanted to fuck me because apparently that's my only value. And since I can't kill myself I'll eventually get old and ugly and then I'll be nothing.I can't even think straight or stop crying long enough to properly end this rant so TR;DR: I hate my stupid piece of shit self and I wish I could just sleep forever and dream about not being a loser fuck up"
I'm so tired. I can't do it anymore,"I'm so fucking tired and I don't understand why everything has to keep going wrong. I'd just gotten back into studying at uni after taking time off because one of my tutors died back in March and I broke my arm in April. Then I go and break my other arm while rollerblading. Shattered my wrist entirely and underwent surgery to have a plate and screws inserted. Found out a few weeks after that I have early osteoporosis. I'm only 30. It explains why my arms keep breaking, but I'm gutted.  Can't cope with any of this. I've been on antidepressants since June but I still feel like shit. And guilty. I have moments where I don't want to be here but I feel bad because of all the effort the doctors and surgeons went to to fix my wrist and the physios who are helping restore my movement. On top of that my uni has decided to no longer offer counselling to students so I have no one to talk to. I just tried a crisis line an hour ago and the guy was totally fucking useless. And now I feel like shit and want to overdose. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS??????????"
It's been a while...,I'm not sure if this is allowed and im so sorry if its not... but I just didn't know where else to post this. About 2 and a half years ago I posted here on a random account. A lot of bad things had happened and I really wanted to end all my pain. I felt so alone and unloved. So many people here talked to me and made me feel better but I was still so down that I had my mind made up. Long story short I failed and ended up in the hospital. There was one person in particular that I remember talking to me the most. I remember the last message he sent me said he would talk to me the next day and that if he didn't hear from me again then he'd know the worst had happened. Unfortunately I can't remember their name or even the account I used so I have no way of finding them... i know its been so long but if you're still out there I just wanted you to know that I am okay... I made it somehow. And now I'm planning on getting married to the love of my life. I still get suicidal thoughts but I can handle it a little better these days. And I just wanted to say thank you to that one awesome person and all the other kind stagers here. I know it's vague but it's all I've got :( sorry if I worried anyone...
I'm going to snap,"I don't know if I'm going to break everything in my house or if I'm going to kill myself. But I can't fucking take this shit anymore. I thought I'd be able to get two appointments with my therapist this week, but of course that couldn't happen. I have no support outside of that. Every minute of every day is nothing but fucking PAIN. JUST MAKE IT STOP"
One Day,"I want a gun and then bye bye
No more having to deal with anyone else's stupid bullshit
It looks like I have it together but I have a burning desire to drop dead after silly little things because I am not fit for this place and it is so apparent
Everyone is so dumb the most stupid of things need an apology
If I could just SHUT THE FUCK UP forever and stop being on social media i could survive but that's not happening cause I can't do that cause I'm retarded"
Can't take it anymore. Don't want it anymore.,"Feel lame for posting what I feel like is just an attention seeking cry for help but I'm also feeling dangerously more depressed than usual and have no other outlet to go to.I've been suffering with depression, anxiety, and mental illness for the better part of 20 years. Have been on almost every antidepressant, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic and mood stabilizing medication you can think of, and endless combinations of them mixed and matched together. None have helped. Have been hospitalized five times in my life for suicide attempts, twice in the past six months at a state mental hospital. Only made me feel worse. Been in professional therapy for just as long and it's a waste of time for everyone involved.I've been diagnosed with autism just recently at the age of 30 and have likely been struggling with it for years. I am consumed by stress, anger, and hatred, and am on the verge of being an alcoholic if I'm not one already. I'm in a large amount of debt and have a shitty unfulfilling job with no health insurance so my options are limited to cheap and often inefficient uncaring providers. I have no real friends and my very limited family understands nothing of mental illness and would only care if I was gone due to the inconveniences it would cause them. I don't want it anymore. I feel like I don't truly want to get better. I don't enjoy life, and I'm tired of the constant uphill struggle for no reward. I didn't ask for any of this and I just want out. I'm not equipped to deal with it anymore...I never was. I'm angry and hurt and scared and don't know what to do. I refuse to go back to the hospital, I will choose death any day of the week over that bullshit.I'm sorry. I feel foolish to post this at all. I wish this on no one."
Do the suicidal thoughts go away?,"I first started having them earlier this summer in the aftermath of an extremely painful break up. I constantly wanted to swerve into oncoming traffic or just fall from a high place. It was an outlet, some way for me to feel something, anything when all that was left was emptiness. Towards the end of the summer things took a change. I lost all sense of hope, and now I'm distancing myself from everyone. It's no longer about the break up, more my failure as a person. (Although though I still can't get her out of my head.) I don't know if I will be able to make it to December so that I won't have to face my family as the disappointment I've become. For me what's scary is that none of this feels new. It's the same feeling I've always had, it's just never given itself form. I don't know if it will ever go away, since it has always been there. Do they go away?"
13 year old daughter tried to overdose,"HiI am not sure if this is where I post this and if it's the wrong place please redirect me.12 weeks ago my 13 year old daughter took an overdose, thankfully she told me and I was able to help her before it was too late.Her reasons for taking this action was severe bullying at school.  She is seeing a counsellor as often as she needs.  I enrolled her and have been taking her to a weekly program that helps rebuild confidence and self esteem which she graduates from this week.  I have also taken her to a colour and Bio Rhythm Therapist for healing as I believe we need to heal her mind, spirit and body; we have another two sessions to go.  And I bought her some Angel Oracle cards for positive daily affirmations that she can carry on her whilst at school.I have been dealing with the school to ensure that she feels safe, and I stay in contact with her by txt during her breaks telling bad jokes, sending funny pictures trying to keep her spirits up etc.Every afternoon when she comes home we talk about her day, I'm trying to help her de-stress and analyse things that have happened.I am worried that what I am doing won't be enough, that I won't be able to save her.  I believe we have a close relationship and I knew she was unhappy and that kids where not being very nice, I didn't know how much it was affecting her because at home she was still cheeky and fun loving but she didn't want to go anywhere unless she was with family.We are also talking about her going to live with her Grandparents so she can attend a different high school, although I would hate that as I'd miss her like crazy.At her current school the number of kids that are self harming is astronomical but I have learned that a number of the high schools in my country are experiencing this issue and as a Mother that is extremely frightening.If you can think of anything else I can do for her I would be extremely grateful."
Pondering the End.,"I have anxiety and Severe Depression. I have been on a self destructive path for 2 months now. Since my break up. We were of two different lives. We drank daily. She got offered a position Mon-Fri in which she didnt have to drink daily. I continued that tradition solo. Now I ruined it all. AA doesnt help because it doesnt rid my pain of her being gone. She was my everything. And since she left I made sure, not intentionally, that her and her family would never be back in my life. It was my only solution. Thanks to alcohol. Now, Ive sought help everywhere. I havent drank in a week. But she is going out Friday night with her friends. She will have no problem meeting anyone. Meanwhile, Im stuck in the dark pits of depression. I can hang on til Friday. Sure. But come Friday, i think a big bottle of booze and pills. This time I wont let anyone know where I am or what Im doing.But she will find out, when my body is found. But if she comes on here. I want her to know that this isnt her fault. Its my fault. It's my fault I created this path for us. She is my soul mate. And I dont have the patience to find the proper help. I dont have the patience to better myself without her. And were both Mental Health Workers. Its fucked. But anyways. Ive never posted her but have found calm in reading others stories. Peace ���"
I feel better,"Hi this is an alternate account but I thought I would tell you all, a few years ago I hit rock bottom. I couldn't find a boyfriend, I got demoted at work, and I found myself off long-term sick and just sat around moping at home alone every day. I had no prospects and no future. And so I OD'd on some medication. It was fucking stupid. I vomited it back up. Since then my life has got better. Unexpectedly. You never ever know what the next day might bring. I learned to drive. I have a new job, new friends that really care about me, I have a new career prospect opening soon, I've taken up art and crafts which makes me happy, things like woodwork and cosplay. Most importantly I met the love of my life and we've recently bought a house together. It's the most wonderful feeling. I don't mean to brag or boast. I simply wanted to share, me at my absolute worst and seeing no future, and just being all but dead every day, I just existing, to now, a happy independent man who loves life. I never ever would've thought that just two years ago today, I would try to kill myself and now two years later things have done an about turn. Two years seems like a long time. But things will get better. "
Unsure That I Can Continue To Go On,"Lately I've been feeling a mixture of emotions . And I'm very confused as to why I'm still in such a negative state . I've been really trying to do better for myself . I'm keeping myself somewhat healthy . I'm trying a bit more in school . I try to talk to people as much as possible . I get outside as much as I can comfortably . I take my medication .
      I'm still absolutely miserable . I hate myself . My body despite my attempt at being healthy , is pretty bad . Especially since I'm young . My face is my best feature and that's saying something because I don't have a good looking face to begin with .
     I feel unfulfilled . I know that fulfillment comes with time and effort but I've been trying to do some things to feel more accomplished and I just can't . It isn't enough . I'm not adding anything to society around me and that's important for me. Not as much as I should be doing is always what I think .
     And another big thing that makes me feel awful is my lack of companionship. I feel emotionally cold at night knowing that there isn't anyone that wants to be with me . And I know that isn't abnormal because everyone generally wants to be loved in some way .
      Just a whole mix of everything going on makes me feel like a horrible person . I feel like ending it and legitimately I could most likely do it very easily now.  Everyone thinks that I'm getting better . I could very well fake recovery and then just give up . I'm rambling but the main point is that I'm confused as to where to go from this point . I could try to keep going but my state of mind is deteriorating so the other (and frankly the easier and somewhat better) is suicide . "
I'm ugly.,I don't want to live anymore I'm to ugly to care about being alive. I'm ugly and I'm stupid.
I'm holding on for my cousins,"So I'm in this program where I do my let two years of high school and my first two years of college at the same time.I'm taking 4 AP classes, along with the college classes.It is intensive. And I can't deal with the stress anymore. I don't know how I manage to make it through every day. I have a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I take a daily anti depressant. And yet, the only reason I'm alive is because of my little cousins.They're both 6 years old, and I can't bear the thought of my family having to explain the concept of suicide to them. Thus, I'm still here."
Don�۪t feel like trying anymore,"To make a long story shorter, I�۪ll give you the TL:DR of my life. When I was four my dad drank and drive and then hit and killed and old lady and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. My mom, who had only ever had summer jobs as a teenager, was forced to take care of me and my two sisters and didn�۪t do that great if a job (Not that a blame her all that much, I understand her life wasn�۪t that great either). She started doing drugs and hanging out with iffy people and leaving me I�۪m iffy people�۪s care. She started dating a guy on and off for almost nine years who was a registered sex offender and, as a result, I got taken away by CPS quite a few times. One of the people she left me with was a family friend who ended up molesting me when I was about ten. We moved around a bit and I stayed with family members or family friends whenever I was taken away.  When I was about 12 we settled in one place finally and my dad was released out of prison on good behavior. When I was 14 I started dating my best friend and came out to my mother that I was gay, which she accepted. My dad did not, and to this day sends me religious things telling me to repent before I go to hell. My sisters, who are much older and who I�۪m not very close with, have always been iffy on it (for example, I wasn�۪t allowed to bring my then fianc̩e over last Christmas because of it.) High school was an iffy time as well, my relationship wasn�۪t stable as my girlfriend had loads of mental problems and baggage as well. I ended up breaking up with her after some problems and I treated her like absolute shit, along with most of my friends. Life had handed me a bad hand and I was angry about it and took it out on the people I cared about, which was shitty. I dated a new girl who broke up with my my senior year and caused me to go into a worse depression. I got back with my ex and we dated until now, my sophomore year in college. I even proposed last year and we had plans on getting married this December. Yesterday, I found out she had been messaging her ex who I didn�۪t like (Had tried many times to get her back all throughout high school and college) about meeting up and getting drunk and so on. I confronted her and asked her why, and she confessed she was scared because she didn�۪t want the same things in life as me. I don�۪t even know what we are anymore (just know we aren�۪t getting married, that�۪s for sure). I�۪ve spent the past two days laying in bed crying. When I was younger and depressed I was angry and wanted action. I would write suicide notes and lash out and such, but now I don�۪t have the energy. I don�۪t even think I have the energy to kill my self, but I know for a fact if there was a button I could press to wipe me out of existence I would do it without hesitation. I�۪ve hurt so many people I love and honestly I don�۪t deserve their forgiveness. I want to fix so many things but I�۪m honestly such a broken human being that I know I would mess it up and just hurt more people. My fianc̩e? Girlfriend? Friend? Says she wants to still be with me and that even if we part later we can still enjoy each other now but I don�۪t think I could handle it. Fuck, I can�۪t handle it now. I feel like I�۪m being crushed by everything that has ever happened to me or that I�۪ve done and that I can�۪t breathe. I want to die so I don�۪t hurt anyone else and that I don�۪t hurt anymore. This was one of my worst fears realized. I know being with another person is hard and I know it�۪s a lot of work and I was willing to do that with her, but sometimes it doesn�۪t work out. Sometimes no matter how much you love someone and no matter how hard you work you just want different things and that scared me so much and now it�۪s true. We both love each other but in the end one of us won�۪t be happy and for that we can�۪t be together and...idk. I just feel broken. I don�۪t have the energy anymore to type, I�۪m sorry for rambling. "
just procrastinating again,"missed an assignment yesterday... missing work deadlines...  not filing my reports n stuff.   everything is just at the edge, i could put a real life together... but why?  what's so great about living?  iunno, i just wish i could just kill myself, but like everything else, i'm too worthless to do anything"
I made a promise,"I recently entered a great high school, one of the best in my state, and my mom is super excited about it, but honestly, while I've made some good friends and like learning, I still don't enjoy it. Every night I dread the next day because I'll have to put on a facade and pretend I'm happy and care free. Oh yeah, and I'm almost always feeling empty and lonely and think about suicide almost every day, so that really helps! Anyways, the promise is that if I fail all of my classes, I'll kill myself. It's that easy, I'll be able to escape me disappointing my family like I always do! I'll be able to escape the loneliness, the dread, everything that constantly weighs me down! I'll be able to spend an eternity in the paradise of non existence! But if I'm too pussy for that, I guess I'll drop out and maybe work up the courage to kill myself later on. "
Need help with suicidal (??) ex-boyfriend,"Hey guys I just needed some advice and made a throw away because my ex knows my reddit account.Okay so me and my ex broke up about a month ago but we still talk everyday, we still have sex sometimes, and we also sometimes hang out (and it's a lot of fun, we laugh a lot!). He broke up with me because I just wasn't that good of a girlfriend and did some pretty mean things and things just didn't work out and he just needed space and didn't need my life in his hands (I threatened suicide many times in order to get him to stay with me, manipulative and shitty I know.. and I know better now). After a long time of crying and feeling suicidal myself I'm finally just okay about things between us. Today he told me he's been feeling so suicidal lately and the only reason he won't kill himself is because of his little sister. He feels so alone and feels like he has no real friends. His family sent his to a RTC for 2 years and he has this resentment towards his parents because they sent him away because he pissed dirty but not when he tried killing himself (so he knows it wasn't out of them caring about him). I told him so many times that I care about him and love him a lot still but he just doesn't feel it and believe it.In my communications class we learned about this thing called a ""love language"" and long story short he really only feels love through service (actions) and I really only feel love through affirming words. So for a long time we were just not sending love that is catered to each other because he would always show me but never really tell me and I would always tell him but never really show him. Okay so anyways, I want advice on how to show him I care and love him through actions, this was my first real relationship and i'm still rusty on what to do. I want him to not feel suicidal and depressed.
** How do you guys feel validated and loved through actions? what are some things people do that makes you feel good about yourself and life?  **I know this post probably belongs in the relationship subreddit but I would never go there for actual advice and him (and I) being suicidal just felt like this was a good place to go, since I OFTEN post here on my main account and I just feel so comfortable expressing myself here (but also I do delete my posts after my episode goes away)thank you "
Carotid,"Best method to constrict carotid artery such that I lose consciousness?  Need to keep airway open.  Please note I will be alone, no assistance from outside party. <Thanks"
I'm trying SO HARD (crosspost from /stopselfharm),"To not hurt myself badly or worse. I can't stop crying... thinking about my ex with his new g/f. I can't take it anymore. I have neurological problems that are getting worse. Such bad anxiety, cutting isn't enough anymore. I want to just go out at night and be raped and killed."
Am I selfish (sister of suicidal person),"I'm the younger sister of a suicidal person, I'm going into uni this fall. I'm going to school out of state (5 hr plane away) and my mom is actually with me rn to get me settled and stuff. Yesterday we had a scare when my sibling's S.O. texted my mom and said my sibling was suicidal. My sibling has been in outpatient therapy for about 5 days and they said yesterday was just a bad day for them. But my mom decided to come home tomorrow bc my sibling is alone at home and ofc she's worried about what they'll do. I understand this and I was the one who actually convinced my mom to go home early bc I want my sibling to be safe. However I really feel kinda upset about her going home early? Growing up my other siblings were always the ones who got all the attention and I was the one left in the dust. I know they're not doing this for attention but I can't help but feel like it's never my turn? I don't want to be like this bc my sibling needs all the support they can get right now. Am I being selfish? "
A rather comforting realisation...,"Im a 15 year old who's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I take medication for both and have had a lot of shit with school and my wellbeing. I always used to hide away and think how pointless everything is and how it doesn't matter one way or the other. I still believe in that but i have a new perspective on it. The way i see it now is i am free to experience different aspects of life and see what I create of this. And the most comforting part of this stems from my fear of having a shit life. Which is that when all is over, nothing will matter either way...Opinions on my ideas?"
"It's weird. Even when I don't necessarily feel depressed, the thoughts are still there.","I guess a part of me just knows it's inevitable. A lot of the time, I feel like I'm mourning for my own death. "
Tonight I almost overdosed on pills. Tomorrow I'm getting help.,"I've been considering going to counselling for a while now. Just a few days ago I finally started looking at places I could go to. And today I almost killed myself. I'm not going to put it off any longer. This wasn't my first close call, but it was definitely the worst. I now know that I am no longer in control of my emotions. I now know that this goes beyond just a depression. I now know that I'm ruining my relationship with my girlfriend, the only thing I ever hold on to anymore. I now know that I'm a danger to myself and others. As long as I can make it through the night, I will finally go get help tomorrow. I really do want to change - well, I have to change - and hopefully this will be the first step in doing so. I am a little skeptical, it seems like a lot of the process is about ""goals"" and ""next steps,"" which doesn't sound like it will really help. I also worry I won't say the right things, that I won't get my point across and fully explain the way I'm feeling. I don't think I know anything about the way I feel to be honest. And in general, the whole process of counselling is very intimidating to me. This is probably my last hope, so again, here's hoping. "
Leaving Due to Chronic Pain,"I'm not sure what to do, I feel like I can't go on.My chronic pain is getting in the way of my dreams, Its hard to focus on anything. Im unemployed despite searching for work the past year. Im useless when I volunteer because of the pain. Ive been homeless, my parents threaten to kick me out on a weekly basis. I want to make the world a less painful place.I have memory problems from a previous injury, Im not as smart as I used to be, Im constantly in agony. I feel like its time to end things. I need to give myself some mercy."
everything hurts and theres nothing i can do about it,"In 2014 i got a really bad concussion at a water park with my younger sister. Ever since then i got really bad migraines about everyday when i got home from school. We went to the doctor and they said i have Chronic Migraine syndrome (you can look it up if you dont know what it is), so they gave me medicine for my migraines and nothing works. Ive been in and out of the hospital a lot of times, they tell me to try all different kinds of things and nothing works i feel hopeless. They have put me on home bound all last year and i thought i would be able to go back this year but my migraines started up again so my put me on home bound until Christmas. i feel so alone and isolated, at this point i stopped taking my anxiety pills because even if i take them i still get migraines and my anxiety is still there. Ive told my mom countless times i need something stronger but she refuses because ill get addicted to something, and i understand that but i really need something stronger my anxiety at this point is making me so depressed i cant handle it. Ive had to even steal pills from my mom when my migraines get too bad and i cant handle it. All my friends dont talk to me anymore and call me hopeless and that ill never get better so there is no point in us being friends. Im so sick of everything, the pain, the isolation, my anxiety its all to much and i know i cant kill myself, the only reason im still alive is because of my sister. the thought of leaving her behind makes me sick. i just need someone, im so alone and i cant talk to my sister  she is too young to understand. I just want to give up but i cant, i feel so trapped. I need advice or just someone to tell me im not going crazy.  i constantly have thoughts of dark things like suicide and what it would be like if my whole family was dead and it was just me and i know this is not normal. i need help."
Last cry for help (with suicide note),"I have written my suicide note as below and now I just feel like a failure for not trying hard enough to save myself. Please let me know what you think I should do. I think I have tried everything.""I just wanted to thank you for being in my life no matter how brief that may have been. You have brought joy and love to my life and I cannot begin to explain how grateful I am for that. If you�۪re reading this, I would have attempted suicide for what will hopefully be the very last time. I am sure you will have your own feelings about this and I assure you they are valid and I respect them.I have been depressed for most of my life. Now that doesn�۪t mean the happy moments we have had were fake, they were real but I guess they were just too far and few in between. This year would prove to be unbearably painful for me. I started to experience hallucinations.  Voices that just wouldn�۪t leave me alone. Voices that would put me down and instruct me to harm myself and others. My grasp of reality was loosening. What followed was months spent in pain and alone.I would finally ask for help. They put me on meds, people would come to check on me and when things really got bad I was admitted to hospital. However, the drugs numbed me emotionally. I didn�۪t feel sad anymore but then again I didn�۪t feel anything. There was no point to anything and I was better off feeling depressed. A few months later my hallucinations would come back and my mood would drop. I have had enough. Believe me. I have tried but I have come to the conclusion that I am unfit for life. I cannot support myself and refuse to be a burden to my friends, family, and society for the rest of my life. I was once hoping to do good in the world but now I realise I have become a liability. My medication doesn�۪t work and Im tired of trying. I always get my hopes up just to have them completely destroyed. I have had enough.
Sorry for probably ruining your day, but I just wanted to let you know that you are special and I hope you have a beautiful life. Thanks,"
I feel awkward talking to my friends,"Throwaway time, I just feel really bad lately but depressed would be an overstatement I guess and I didn't know where to post to ask for help. I have a lot of friends (like we're a group of 10 or so) and I can trust everyone I think. However, I really feel awkward talking to them about how I feel lately to not be laughed at like I am a drama queen or something (because I always seem happy and dont mind stuff generally,idk what's wrong lately) since they wont believe I am not joking.What you guys do , I really have no one to talk to about my ""depression"" as of late :\"
Feeling Suicidal But Don't Want to Be,"I've been suicidal for a long time. I've attempted in the past. Right now I'm going through a hard time trying to take care of a friend who's just getting worse. I want to be able to support them properly, but at the same time I feel like I can't and I want to die, but I don't. I'm trying to reach out to professionals to ask how I could better help my friend during this... I don't know what to do. If I lose my friend then I'm dying too. I won't be able to handle it. "
Troubled,"Im 14 and my girlfriend just dumped me because I did something really bad, not cheating-level but bad, and she's telling my friends and they all are turning against me and I just feel really empty inside and I don't want to go to school and I realised that many of my friends are toxic and it hurts that the only person who isn't toxic to me is my girlfriend... I miss her so much and I love her and I don't know why I did that but I can't do anything to get her back now she's moved on and I'm stuck I don't know. Anyone I can talk to? I can't anymore I can't"
Piercings,"Piercings are something I use to express myself,
but when they put the needle through my lip or ears it gives me the same feeling that self-harming does, it numbs the pain for a split second, though with piercings people won't throw me in a mental hospital like they would if they seen my cuts & burns."
i rlly want to die and that makes me rlly sad because i have nothing to be sad about??? i have no family issues no relationship problems and life should be good and that makes me even more sad,I want you to know that I feel 100% exactly the way you do. I have such a good life I just don't understand why am so miserable. So I don't know if that helps you anyway but I did want to tell you that.
Recovering emotionally from an attempt,"Last year, after at least 6+ major life events happened over just a few months, I attempted suicide with a method that would have killed me had I not texted for help (something I don't even remember doing). I actually posted here on a different account before and after. I spent 2.5 weeks in the hospital, and I'm on different meds for my depression/anxiety now.My question now is... How can I recover emotionally from the attempt when the primary thing that pushed me over the edge was my shame over my impaired sexual development? That's not something that I can easily change about myself. Can I ever be at peace? A conversation with my mom triggered thoughts about suicide again today, and all the therapy sessions I've had since last year have been pointless, because they can't fix the underlying issue behind my desire to end it all."
i've never been as suicidal as i've been this past month or two,i've started thinking up a plan. i've started writing letters to people. i don't have anything concrete but it's calming to think that the end is in sight and eventually i will be free
I feel myself giving up more and more each day,"Hi, I have no idea where to turn. I am convinced that I have maybe borderline or bipolar. I am tired of being dramatic, attention seeking and trying to use my friends as a support system. it's pretty clear that after 3 weeks straight of my hopelessness they are over it and you know they have to deal with their own lives and can't be at my beck and call if I need help with stabilizing myself. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. Even the hotlines seem scripted and awful. "
I'm so fucking lonely.,I don't fucking know what to do.  I've been on and off having suicidal thoughts for the past 6 years or so but it's the worst it's ever been now.  I've been missing classes and some days I just lay in bed all day.  I'm a long way from home for college and my only social interaction outside of the classes I attend is when I see my family during breaks.  I used to be really social and had tons of friends but now I don't have anyone.  The only thing that's kept me from killing myself is knowing how heartbroken my family would be bit the longer I'm away the less of a motivation that is.  I go to the campus center to get food some days just so I can sit near other people. I crave human interaction but I don't have any and I'm terrified of putting myself out there.
Sex repulsed and feeling hopeless,"Hello reddit. I'm at the end of my rope. Nothing but these harmful thoughts have been in my mind for weeks. For the past two years I've been with someone i care for very much. This person wasn't aware of this when we got together and was the one to take my virginity because I was never okay with it before, but wanted to give them a chance... a few months in, they found out I was against sex and touch of most kind. I dislike being kissed, I dislike being held for long periods, I dislike sex immensely. It is painful for me and I feel miserable, disgusted every time. This partner has started suggesting that they can no longer go on with a ""loveless"" relationship, so I need to ""Shut up, and take it"" instead of telling them no. I can't do it. But I can't leave, either. I rely on them, live with them, financially we share our responsibilities and I'm unable to pay for our home by myself. I'm at my wits end. If not for my cat I'd be gone by now. I think nothing but 'I want to die', 'I hope I get hit by a car today' or 'I hope I get into a coma so I can wake up and this'll be over'. I'd be so much happier if I knew this would come to an end and I wouldn't be forced to be in pain, uncomfortable, miserable for the rest of my life, relying on someone to keep me alive when I could end it. I'm feeling hopeless. "
Ok now I'm scared,"I was so certain that I'd be able to go to school and get into a trade and that would be a high paying job that would allow me to live my life. But I totally didn't realize that for every trade you need math skills. I am not mathematically inclined. In fact, I'm shit at it. Maybe some trades have less or simpler math than others? Am I doomed to fail at life because of my sheer lack of intelligence!!? "
I honestly don't know what to do.,Just in the last hour my roommates unanimously agreed that I have to go. I don't have any family to fall back on and I just emptied my bank account trying to make sure myself and all my roommates were covered on bills. I don't have the money to support myself without a roommate or even buy food to subsist off of. I am so lost. I don't have a vehicle to transport any of my stuff in or get to work with if I can't find a place to go nearby.
"Fuck dude, I just need someone",There's no one I can tell what I'm actually thinking. I've just been on this decline of wanting to kill myself and now instead of trying to get better I just try to convince myself more and more to do it
Self Destructing,"You ever purposely do things that you know will make your life worse?  You stay up late posting on suicide forums knowing that it will make work awful tomorrow?  You ever sit at work, doing nothing, knowing that it will get you closer and closer to being fired?  You ever lie in bed all morning, instead of driving to work, so that you'll be late and everyone will look down on you?  You ever avoid paying your bills, day after day, even though you never really forget... you just avoid doing it.Ever since my father died, I have felt like I'm playing a game of Marco Polo.  But, no one calls out Polo in return.  I'm just blind, wandering around with no purpose.  Is there anyone out there at all?  I know there might be, but I'm too afraid to open my eyes.I just want to make it to the weekend.  Please, God, let me make it to the weekend."
How long can someone really be expected to feel like this?,"First post here. I'm desperate. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this. I'm just so fucking tired of fighting. I'm tired of fighting to stay clean, fighting to stay healthy and happy. Lately, it seems like a fight just to get out of bed and be a human being. Is it selfish of me to want to die or is it selfish of everyone else to expect me to keep living like this? I feel like an old puzzle that has lost so many pieces over the years that there's no hope for a complete picture anymore. I just need to be thrown out. "
PLEASE,"I can�۪t take it anymore. I just want to die. I don�۪t care about the aftermath of the pain of family & friends. There is legitimately no way it compares to my own. I just need a painless way to die. I�۪ve considered flipping my car, putting a knife in an outlet, pulling a cord tightly around my neck, etc etc. I need something easy. I can�۪t take it "
I've been feeling hopeless,Every day is torture. I've been dealing with gender dysphoria for most of my life and it's gotten to the point where it feels like nothing will ever get better. I'll never be able to live my life to the fullest. I just want to die so I don't have to suffer anymore. Whenever I try to talk to my family or school counselor about this they just call me selfish and never offer any help. I can't even kill myself because I'm under 18 and can't buy any drugs or weapons. I'm going to be stuck in this miserable spiral forever.
Finally gonna do it,Guys I m finally got enough courage to do it after some very bad news...wish me luck ..hope jumping of 13th floor is enougg
Being a human naturally disgusts me.,"I hate humanity for it's inability to be realistic, progress, and care about something other then its self. In some ways I would argue that I'm from another galaxy. I don't believe it but it's possible. Everyday all I see is the selfish, hypocritical, double standard falsehood that is humanity. I believe it is our job as humans to band together and only serve the earth. In reality things like politics, religion, drugs, money, alcohol, and too many things too name don't matter. It is only important if we say it is. All life is equal and the food chain only exists to humans to make ourselves feel better about not being the strongest or the fastest. We can't stop nature from killing each other and that is ok but instead we can work on the planet to make it stronger and breath easier and give strength to all living creatures. Instead humans focus on celebrities, false idols, killing ""annoying creatures"" simply because most deem them annoying. We have been given a gift to help most beautifully and time and time again we pretend that only humans are important. Maybe our only purpose is to properly help the planet, universe, and everything we can. Not to be martyrs but because it's only right. I don't need a higher power to tell me how to behave and neither do you. This is not a slight at religion but about how people worry about nonsense when instead we can do what's right. It's also not about right and wrong as it simply is not opinion that helping out around the globe for the globe can only be great! Yet the sespool that is humanity doesn't try, care, or seem to have time. I hate to be conscious because of the unfortunate group of people that I share a species with. I care not to be with you people and sometimes I wish someone would end my time so I don't have to be aware of the opportunity squandered by humanity. Yet I live for the only thing I hate. I believe that one day people will change. I have never met anyone who feels the same. I can't escape my conciousness for who knows why. It's 24/7 and I want it to stop. I won't do anything even when this post is forgotten but maybe if someone out there feels the same then know your not alone and I'm out there fighting with you my brothers and sisters. "
I just don't know what to do anymore....,I've been lost for a while now... I don't know what to do... I'm highly considering suicide because life has been so pointless and crap lately and it feels like I'm in my own bubble and no one can help or get to me... no one would want to... I'm sorry for bringing this but I don't have another place to turn
Important,"Are there any websites that condone suicide, or something like that? Yes this is a serious question. "
Tired of sleeping in,Oftentimes I'll find myself sleeping in till past 12 because I cannot sleep at night. I have a day off tomorrow and wanna take full advantage of it but I'm worried I'll sleep like a log for half the day like I did today :(
On a Merry go round (Pet Stuff),"So, I really don't know what to expect from this. I have nowhere to turn and no one to talk to. Maybe it will help to just get the thoughts out there. My dog is sick, I adopted him and he was the runt. He's not even a year old yet. I'm doing everything I can to get him to a vet but my funds are very limited as I am sick myself. This has happened to me before with a previous dog, she was only 4 and at the time I had no money. I begged, cried till my lungs were on fire, and pleaded to my then boyfriend to please help her that there was something seriously wrong. He didn't believe me, called my a hypochondriac and said he had no money. I had called around to different vets and it was going to be 60 some dollars to help her and she would have been fine. He said he couldn't afford it. She died a few days later while I was sleeping. He was sitting right next to her and he didn't do anything, didn't wake me up, he did nothing. She died alone. Come to find out he had over a grand in the bank and he had zero bills to pay for. And now I feel like the same issue is happening all over again. I don't have much but what I do have I'm going to do everything I can to help him but the vet I'm having to take him to can't see him till Friday. If he dies I'm going to end my life. I feel like such a shitty mother. I couldn't take care of one of the things I loved most in this world and here I am maybe about to lose another. They are the only two things I've ever truly loved in the world. I come from a very abusive home, have been treated like trash and abused by ex's and I feel like my two dogs are the only things in the world who have loved me. I couldn't fail another one and be able to live with myself for letting him die. The best thing I can think of if this does happen is just to not let him die alone. I couldn't make it without him anyway. I'm utterly alone. I'm sorry this was so long. But if anyone actually makes it this far thank you. I am grateful."
Not sure why I'm bothering with this honestly..,"4th time I've wrote this.. Keep backspacing because I feel so silly and guilty taking this to strangers, putting my problems in others lives.
I'm really close you guys, ya know?
It's not even to a point where its a big deal anymore, It just feels.. right.
I'm pretty done with this world as of now, I've come to realize I don't care about anything or anyone..
For the longest time I've been fascinated with death.. And this concept of eternal peace sounds comforting.
No more dealing with daily problems, and even outside of problems, all I've accomplished in this life is hurting others and hurting myself, putting my own mindset into such a low space that I don't matter to myself anymore.
I'll probably get a few views, maybe a comment or two, but my point is none of this matters.
I was on here helping someone just a few minutes ago and seeing how similar they are to me fucked my shit up
I don't know how much longer I can last, and I don't give a fuck about anything.
I'm either going to hurt myself or get myself killed by the police. It's repeating in my head over and over. "
I've been thinking...,"Hello!Throughout the past few months i've been thinking about my life lately. Let me see where i should start. I'm a first year college student who is studying abroad. At first i was alright with the idea of coming to another country to study and learn their culture. Probably a month ago i felt confident that i can make it in college. I've been dreaming about where i'm going to be in the future. One of the main reasons why i'm studying medicine abroad is that my hometown is limited with their med majors. I saw it an an opportunity to explore what's it like outside of my home.All of that changed by the time i set foot in my college. Prior to this, i've been given this idea that the college that i will be attending is ""international"", particularly prominent in english. By the time i entered my designated class for orientation, everyone spoke in their native tongue. I had to notify everybody (students, faculty, etc.) about my dilemma. I knew that i had to learn the language someday, but i didn't expect it to occur that quickly. Aside from this language barrier my ability to understand in college has been rather difficult. My schedule for college seemed right before hand since i felt confident when i read it (curse my lazy senior year in high school).  I've been feel overwhelmed every time i start my classes. I always felt like i'm stressed out every time. The worst part is when i knew i couldn't take and i'll i could think about it to simply end it once and for all. I took counseling at least 2 during the two months and i don't think it's working. My counselor seemed well and my classes as well. I think the problem is just me as a whole. I can't cooperate properly. It's probably because that i'm stressed about college lately. I've been having morbid thoughts about life though, especially before. I can't really say that i'm always depressed all of the time but i usually hide it in front of my peers or family members. At most, they would see me stay quiet all of the time. I haven't eaten properly during the first 2 weeks of college because i took on the idea to ""breathe studying"" since i'm in college and in a med major.My confidence crashed to the ground when my classes started. I felt like i can handle the work at first but when everything weighed on me i just been having a harder time ti cope with it. My peers seem to be fine with the work and they would achieve high grades. I don't mean to compare myself to them but it's just that i'm trying to at least not fall beindRight now, there hasn't been much classes lately due to a variety of events and my exams (hopefully i didn't fail). However, i know that by the time the class starts again, i will go back to being stressed out all of the time. I'm afraid to become depressed again and even through counseling advice it hasn't motivated me enough to escape it.The worst part of all is that i'm afraid to go back to hometown and study there. I might study into a different course aside from med but i'm afraid i might not succeed there as well. I've really been thinking too much about this but it's the fact that this is the next step to my life and i'm afraid to mess that up. That's where i fall into depression and thoughts of suicide. It's a horrible habit and i don't know how to overcome this situation."
I start university for my final year next week and I don't think I can take it anymore!,It's so stressful and I feel inferior to everyone in my class. I just feel like I lucked out and got into university somehow. I hate my life and I know that this year is going to be worse than last year. I'd be much better off killing myself than go through another year of failing and knowing that I'm not as good as my classmates. I want to end it this week and not have to suffer knowing that I'm a failure at life.
Anyone been suicidal since childhood?,"I'm currently 29 and I have been suicidal since age 5. I remember running away in the middle of the night at age 5, hoping to find something....anything to take me away. Death, a stranger, anything. Now I am 29. Life hasn't been bad for me, and I feel guilty wanting to die whilst living a relatively comfortable life. But I can't stop thinking about the sweet release of death. I've been working 40+ hours a week since I was 14 and I haven't found anything I'm very interested in. People are the same no matter where you go or what you do. Just self-absorbed and uncaring. All these comments on this sub and all the suicide-prevention shit is just feel good rhetoric for the care-givers of the world. It's all empty gestures and fake smiles. I can't take all the fake people anymore. I can't tell who is more empty inside, me or them.More than anything, I want to be rid of money. I used to be a friendly, outgoing kid who enjoyed meeting people. Now when I meet someone I am instantly skeptical of how they are planning to rip me off.IDK why I'm posting this. Fuck it."
I'm done and need to do it right fucking now,"I have a knife, a bath, 18 pills of Androcur, 30 of Progynova, some posion in the freezer, a high bulding in 3 kms, a railway in 5 kms. What's the best choice"
What is a painless way to kill yourself?,I've been cutting myself for years but I it always hurts too much to actually cut the veins. I want to know of a more painless way to kill yourself. There has to be something. I just can't continue living in this world where everyone hates me and I continue being afraid to talk to anyone.
Life is getting worse everyday,My life is at the point where I hate waking up to face another day. it's sad but I hope that I will find out I have a incurable medial problem and it will do what I don't have the stomach for. Finding another person that is actually caring is like finding a buried treasure. My family isn't any better than stranger sometimes always looking out for them selves and secretly talking and why I am like this. Everyone always says get over her why can't you move on life is too short or your not helping yourself. I have social anxiety among other issues but mainly it does have to do with losing the person that helped me thru the day just knowing with her everything was going to be alright. I have no one that actually understands me and my ex is starting to hate me because she wants to not have to worry about helping me any more. I think about how lucky I could be to have something that I can do anything about and it will take my life for me. I would almost feel a sense of relief. I have someone I go and talk to but I can't be honest with him due to not wanting to be committed and further making people think I'm crazy. I am a absolute loser in life with nothing to show for these 30 plus years on this earth. I had someone I took for granted and now I'm alone fighting this battle in my head everyday until I finally just give up. people really complex me how they are so shallow and superficial about things in life. There are very few truly good loving caring people in the world it's crazy.
I really want to kill myself for the first time in my life,"My grandmother committed suicide when she was 45. She was bipolar, and she had put her loving husband and 6 children through years of trauma because of her illness. They still hate her for it, but I get where she was coming from.I'm not diagnosed as bipolar, but I seem to feel things more than everyone else. My sads are very sad. My happys are very happy. I recently ruined a 7 year relationship with an amazing person, because I couldn't get my shit together. I have an addictive personality that manifested as an eating disorder. I wasn't good to them. I hate myself for ruining everything. For not being able to be more loving, more stable, more what they needed.I hate myself so much, and I don't want to feel this pain any more. I am so lonely, and I hate everything about my life. My friends are superficial. I get crushes easily on people who could never reciprocate. I had love and I ruined it. I have a job that means nothing to anyone except for capitalists who care about money above all else. I'm not pretty, but most of all I'm not stable. Who could ever love someone, friend or otherwise, who goes through these kind of low periods?My grandmother committed suicide by hanging herself in a shed. It feels like it's my destiny to do something similar. I don't want to live with myself any more. I don't want to be me. I hate who I am, everything I am, and I just want this crushing pain of self-hatred to end. I'll never be anything more than someone with an addictive personality who hurts those they love and can therefore never find or deserve real love. It's what my parents were, it's how my grandmother ended. I hate living like this. "
Give me one reason I shouldn't kill myself to end my suffering,"I've been miserable for the past year. I'm having debilitating diarrhea, loss of appetite, occasional bloody stool, abdominal pain, and weight loss. For the third night this week I awoke due to sudden abdominal pain. The quality of my life is absolute piss.
Parents tell me it's all in my head(also fault of doctor for not taking me seriously) and they won't take me to a doctor and I don't know what to do.
I see no point in continuing to live since symptoms are getting worse and it looks like it could be a long time before I get a correct diagnosis.
I already tried to hang myself few months ago to end my pain but I failed. Next time I'm not so sure."
WHY DOSEN'T IT GET BETTER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"WHY DOES SCHOOL SUCK SO MUCH?!?!?!?! WHY ARE MY PARENTS SUCH DOUCHEBAGS?!?!?!? WHY CAN'T I FIND THE WILL TO LIVE?!?!?!?!?!?! I'M FUCKING 12 AND I WANT TO DIE, EVERYDAY TOMORROW SEEMS SO DISTANT. SOMEBODY HELP ME BEFORE I JUMP OFF A WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I need help but don't want it,"I'm Chris, a 13 year old male who lives in florida, I'm homeschooled and have no friends. I've been suffering from major depression and dysthymia for about a year now and have symptoms of OCD and have told nobody. I've been using weed for about the same time, and it helps me cope with my anxiety... I know my parents do it too but they don't know I know. they have a dab pen, my brother found it and invited me too do it with him, but that's not the main reason I'm deppressed. Anyway,  me and my twin were caught using it at around 3 in the morning. my emotions are going crazy... this was the breaking point for me. I feel like I'm dead inside my depression has been more than ever I started inflicting self harm, my anxiety is out of control and I want too kill myself more than anything in this world. I feel like I'm loosing my grip of reality, and I don't want help but don't know how too cope with this. I'm not sure what's going on with me and I'm confused on my decision too post here. this is possibly the last day I will have my phone, and computer for a while, so I'm going too review comments as long as I have everything. I'm just looking for someone too help me though this or tell me what's going on... I don't want treatment and I don't want too talk too anybody about this. I have severe social anxiety and  have trouble talking too people. I have other secrets that I try too hide and I'm hesitant to say even online. my life is online, I don't interact with anyone but online friends, so I don't even have anyone too talk too... someone help me please. (sorry for incorrect grammar or spelling I usually don't type on my phone at all and autocorrect can be a fag)"
Just took unknown number of valiums and codeine - Farewell,"Can already feel myself drifting off, goodbye.Edit: I'm alive. Woke up sometime earlier on the bathroom floor with a bottle of booze next to me and covered in spew. Cant remember how I got there but Im sick as fuck. Im still alive. Appreciate the support Im still here <3"
I might finally be able to do it,I post here a lot but I might be able to pull it off this time I might finally kill myself I hope I can I'm crying and I hate crying and I hate being autistic and so much I need a hug
I think I'm going too do it,I had another post about it... I think I'm going too go through with it within the next hour.
Suicidal because of heavy financial problems.,"Hey all,I've been having financial problems for the past 7 years or so and it's not because I'm financially undisciplined, in fact I'm frugal and smart about my money. I have terrible luck with employment (only ever had 1 full time job) and I am trying to save money to finish college. I have 3 courses left to finish college and get my bachelor's degree but the lack of it is heavily impeding my chances of holding a steady job that pays me enough to pay my student loans as well as save money for college.Due to this, I resorted to freelancing. It's been great, I've made some money but this financial problem is also with my family and whatever I earned I helped them and I paid my student loan that's due every month. But freelancing is volatile and right now I have an employer who will potentially give me projects but he needs to wait for his clients to pay him. Honestly at this point, I'm fully expecting it to fizzle out because life always finds a way to fuck me anyway.I blame nobody but myself. The path I've gone down has been hard and I could have chosen the easier path, but I made mistakes. All I want is to be able to earn a steadier income to help me build my life but life is just obstructing my path. If this project doesn't come through I'm back to square one and I feel like I should kill myself because I'm running out of energy to even handle this anymore. I'm lost and my mistakes have made a heavy impact on my family and myself. Why bother living if I consistently get fucked over no matter how hard I work and if I just caused burden and hardship to my family and myself? Fuck this life.Also, I don't have any issues with self esteem, women, etc. I'm a pretty normal person and I only need a damn job and money to get me out of this rut. I'm willing to sacrifice a limb or a couple of limbs if it means getting me out of this, honestly."
I'm not the person I want to be,"I believe in hope and getting better, I'm a senior in college and I let depression get the better of me my sophomore year, and it cost me my grades and a number of friendships. The two people I reached out to for help preferred not to deal with me, which I understand. It's tough to talk about, and tougher when you hear it's happening to someone you know.
My brother tried to commit suicide a few months ago, I still remember when he called to tell me, I bawled for hours at the thought of losing him, and now it seems like he's in a good place, and three weeks after that my childhood dog passed away.
I try to think about that when I get dark, I don't want anyone feeling that way, especially not my brother, I love him more than anything in this world.
I'm usually pretty good at shaking off my dark thoughts, staying busy as best I can, but every time I go out and see my friends I see this look in their eyes like they know what a mess I am and are just biding their time with me until graduation.
I had an ill defined relationship with the person who used to be my best friend my freshman year, but she moved on and found someone else and we began drifting apart, I got clingy, and I didn't respect their boundaries and tried to stay friends with both of them, and now they refuse to talk to me.
I'm better than I was, but I still spend most of my nights alone, casual hookups stopped being enough of a distraction and I think it was just unhealthy.
When I think about suicide it's so comforting, and oddly familiar. I think about a noose around my neck or a gun in my mouth or just jumping into traffic...and the worst part is how I think I'll somehow make everyone who hurt me feel like shit.
I don't know where I'm going when I graduate, literally or professionally. I want to start my life and be a better person and the possibilities give me hope but I don't want to look back on my college experience as a low point, and that's how it's shaping up. A number of my relationships are too damaged to fix and I'm scared to keep trying, but more than that I'm scared at the realization that most of my problems are my own fault.
I remember something I read once about the four faces a person wears in life-the first is what they show everyone and how they present themselves to the world, the second is shown to friends and family, the third only to one or two people, and the fourth you never show anyone, and that face is the truest reflection of who you are. My fourth face isn't what I want it to be,  and I think it's just getting worse as life becomes more real."
Getting help,"I'm 39, I can't believe I'm still here. When I was 8 my brother would beat me up everyday after school. I guess he toughened me up. I tried some things sexually growing up that I'm ashamed of, and developed a fetish for anal. The porno industry has kept a customer in me, because I have destroyed every romantic relationship I've ever been in with not cis normative behavior. I'm not attracted to other dudes, but in recent years have moved on to tranny porn as a counter rejection for the way I feel about women. I've studied psychology as a tool to manipulate someone into actually giving a shit to no avail. I am alone. I've always been alone. I will never find love, and I don't love myself. I try to put positive shit out there, like only positive shit, but I think on some level people must see my flaws through it, because nobody actually gives a shit. This shit really fucked me up in narcotics anonymous, coming clean, trusting, and being exposed, or actually branded a fag. I'm not. At any rate, I know this is bullshit, and I could end up hurting some people if I don't get some help, but I've dealt with shrinks, and I think they are a bunch of blood sucking parasites. I just want medication. What would be the most efficient way to get on some anti depressants. I don't want to pay some pretentious prick 4+ of my working hours to every one of his to talk about my feelings."
Two weeks to go,"It's a luxury being a doctor, you get all the classified drugs. I'm going through a shit lot of trauma and I just need two weeks.. to meet that person one last time and ask why the fuck I'm pushed into this corner and I literally have no option left. But I need to survive for the next two weeks so please, somebody keep talking to me. Just for two weeks after which I will ghost away for real. I only have WhatsAppJay"
Should I talk about it to my loved ones?,"The only reason I hang on is not to hurt my loved ones, mainly wife and mother. But life is so heavy, and I suffocate. In a way I'd wish they'd give me their acceptance / or at least forgive me and be able to live on without too much grief. But they'll never accept that, but only be worried and tell me ""it gets better"" and such.. but I don't believe in comfort, it never works more than a few minutes.. I need to be free.. Realistically I'll just make them feel bad, and it won't help anyone. It would be so good if they could let me go, I could give them a good hug and leave in peace.. As it is I'm just feel slightly jealous of people who die from ""natural"" reasons, without having the burden of having destroyed everyone around them..So; any opinions whether to spare them the worry (and if it happens it happens) or to introduce the idea in the hope that they could digest it? Thanks for any insight..edit: as it is, if you want to leave life because you feel too bad, you'll have to hide and do a dirty job of it, while destroying the people around you.. It's really a shame, as if one didn't feel bad enough already.. A legal and accepted solution could have you leave in the arms of those you love, it would be so much better.."
No escape.,One of my friends killed himself this summer. I told myself I didn't want anyone to feel the way I felt over him so I had put away my own suicide thoughts. But it's been long enough where they are coming back. I understand why he did it. There comes a time when someone just feels too trapped and no escape. Those who don't feel the same way will never understand this type of pain.
Fuck school,"Ever since i can remember teachers are the only people that created my problems: social anxiety, depression, feelings of shame. I have to live the rest of my life with panic attacks because they dont enjoy their life. Only reason im not ending it is because i dont want to leave knowing they will be the ones who won."
I need you reading this to send your brain waves in helping me die,idk how to do that... sorry
There's days when I long for a girlfriend,And days when I am all on my own and could not be more at peace. I wish the latter happened more often.
I feel like the meaning of life is to end it,"I'm in my first year in uni, final trimester. I have a beautiful girlfriend who tries her best to understand, but I don't know how to explain how painful and crippling every day is. I dance in my spare time, but lately I feel like an idiot for even picking up something I'll never be good at. I hate that school makes me feel stupid, I hate that there's toxicity everywhere, I hate the fact that I push people away everytime someone tries to be close or be my friend. I hate that I know they're talking about me, but mostly I hate that I don't think I can ever change. My parents'll try to care for a while before totally putting it aside a week or two later. They think I can handle it. But I can't. I tried to jump once but a passerby grabbed me, threw me to the floor and saved me. Sometimes I hate him for doing that. I hate myself. I try to kid myself and say I'm a good person - people say that I am, my girlfriend says that I am. But I know I'm not. I'm the biggest asshole there is. The only thing stopping me is knowing that suicide may cause a lot of inconvenience to people. Who am I kidding, they don't care. I want to stop hurting and crying every day."
I feel like I'm getting close again.,I knew I was getting worse for a while but I has an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up. With the hurricane my appointment was cancelled. I haven't been to classes in two weeks or done any school work. Every time I think about it I realize how big a piece of shit I am and how much I want to die.
Today I told myself I was going to do it.,"I've ""attempted"" suicide a couple times in the past. (Took a fuck ton of pain killers but just got real sick and didn't die)  But recently I've loaded a gun and put it to my head and then chose not to pull the trigger. Today while I was at work I decided I was actually going to pull the trigger tonight, not because today was any worse than normal, but simply because today felt like the right day to do it. At this point I'm pretty drunk and don't think I'll actually do it, but I don't really trust myself. I don't have any money to deal with my mental illness (I live in the US) and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I've tried to reach out to friends but it feels like nobody knows what say. I guess there isn't anything to say. I guess I'm just in this endless cycle where I'll frequently decide to do it and then not actually do it until I finally do."
I've been to a dozen counsellors and I've tried a hundred different meds. I've talked to charities and the A&E. Nothing helps,"You're reaching out.  You're looking for help.  You still have the desire to live, even if the life you're in is not one you want.  Even if your flame for life has been dimmed, it is still burning somewhere deep down.What's going on my man, anything you wanna talk about?"
Trapped in a box. Mentally and physically.,"Hiya Reddit. I hope this is the right sub for this.I've been having suicidal thoughts for awhile now. I've had them for the past couple of years, but recently they've peaked pretty bad.A little bit about me. I'm 16 and bisexual. I live in the south in a medium sized-ish awful town in the great plains. We have a very high crime rate and awful weather usually. Also churches on every street corner so... Not the most LGBT friendly place.As a result of this you can imagine I'm heavily closeted. Which is stressful because my parents are also pretty homophobic. I actually asked my father once what he expected from me in life, and his response was ""Don't turn out gay."" Guess I just disappoint everyone I'm every way possible lol.I've been homeschooled since I was 8. Extremely socially isolated. My only friends are online. My parents are both paranoid conspiracy theory hermit types. They almost never take me anywhere.Also they pretty much gave up on homeschooling me about a year ago. So now I just lay in bed all day doing nothing pretty much. The way the days start to blend into each other is really... Disconcerting.I think I have alot of mental and emotional problems because of the social isolation, and because my parents were always kind of... Emotionally distant and weird. My mom has extreme anxiety problems and my father is very depressed most of the time. I've asked to see a therapist before but (being the conspiracy nuts that they are) they think all therapists are quacks and won't take me to one. (Also we're pretty poor. So affording it would be an issue.)I have hobbies. I play guitar. And I skateboard sometimes. But more and more everything feels meaningless and bland. I don't feel anything anymore. None of the things that made me happy really work anymore and... I don't have the energy to get up and exercise or improve myself.I'm in a rut but I don't see any ways out. None of my family cares or will help me. I've tried. What do I do?"
Severely depressed. Constant anxiety and now insomnia. Failed operation. I just want to die,"Hi, do you feel like talking about things?"
I'm ending it. Don't know why I'm posting this here but I am,Is it selfish to not want to live a life that's unfair and cruel?
This too shall pass?,"I've only been this close a couple other times in my life but I've considered it almost every day as almost an afterthought. It usually just lasts the day or night but I have nothing to keep me busy and I'm so sick of this.I just feel like there's no way I'll ever have any semblance of happiness, I'm too far gone and there's no point in trying. I just want to go on a walk but I know I'd just get in trouble one way or another, it's 3am. So I'm trapped in this room with over 100 RX pills that could definitely kill me and I just feel like I'm suffocating. Nobody seems to care about me, even when they say they do when I try to open up in the slightest they're gone. I just want to be done. Even if I feel okay tomorrow it'll be back in a week or two or five or whatever. Why bother. "
"I just need someone to just, hold me right now, just spent 2 hours in my computer chair shaking and crying into myself..",I feel so alone and I just want to be hold closely by someone and I feel like my mind is running at a mile every second criticizing me for every fucking little thing I do as I cry and I just want to reach out and be held or something stupid like that and I feel like this post will be unanswered and nobody will care but I just need to release this somewhere so I don't keep it in and cry again and I just want know someone cares about me at all and just want someone to hug me I feel so fucking pathetic right now
I've failed,"I feel like I've failed everyone in my life. I'm a 31 year old loser. No career, trying to finish college. My long term girlfriend is now just intolerant of me. I can't seem to do anything right. I've taken over 8 years off and on to finish a 4 year degree. I'm in my final semester after a 2 year break. Things were set up to be PERFECT this fall. My job is great for going to school, despite the shitty pay. Then things just blew up. One thing after another after another have just went wrong. My wonderful and loving significant other is just tired of me. I'm literally a drain on her emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. She wants us to be at the next step in our life together and we can't afford it. She knows this, and it basicly all comes back to me. I should be done with college and have started a family, instead I've pissed away my 20s. I'm so financially unstable that it's a fucking miracle we make it from month to month. I just feel like I've got so much on me and because of my partners anxiety I can't talk to her about our problems. I've found it best not to bring up potential problems or issues until they are actual things that need dealing with. After arguing with her about the same things I haven't done and how I've let her down, I just don't want to do this anymore. I'm just fucking tired of every god damn thing and everyone. I hate my life. I hate the person I am. And I don't see a way of changing any of it. I've tried many many MANY times and this is where it has gotten me. So what's the point? Why am I still suffering through this? Why do I wake up every day and just suffer through this never ending shit?"
Just had my first yearly performance review at current job.,"It went as shit as it could've. My asshole boss has a problem with the fact that my job has a good bit of down time. He expects me to do my job while also coming to him and formen to get more shit to do! So obviously because of this I got a shit review and a 1% raise or about 4 cents. So I broke down crying, told him about anxiety and panic attacks I have and his response? ""Work will help."" No you god damn son of a bitch, work and your sorry ass is the problem!! I'm fucking tired of working and trying to be normal. Nothing works, nothing changes, and nothing ever will. I can't just quit because I need money. To get money I need a job but a job causes me to be miserable literally 24/7. It's always on my mind and even in my dreams when I sleep. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm fucking done with this shit. See you in hell you mother fucker! Hopefully you'll die soon and your employees will piss on your grave"
So stressed out between work and school and life,I dropped out of school and got a shitty job as a custodian. I was planning on not coming back this year but did because I didn't sign up for classes. I have to take a boiler license test in less than a month and I barely studied due to depression of losing all my friends and alot of my family. Every time I think about the test I get panic attacks. Everytime I think about visiting family I get panic attacks. Everytime I realize I have no friends I want to kill myself. I hate socializing with new people especially if theyre not my age. And I feel like an idiot Everytime I do but I'm forced to at work. I want to just drop out of life.
Trans woes,"Ill never be able to transition. I feel like if i dont start soon its gonna be so difficult in my furture, especially health insurance wise. My mom wont even let me ask the doctors about it. And she wont listen to reason. She says hrt will makeme violent and depressed and its a phase and idk what i really want. Ive been wanting T for at LEAST three years now. Yeah my hair is short and i dress as andro as i can, but im misgendered constantly. Knowing that my mom knows and still wont make an effort to help me (even pronoun wise) feels awful. And the fact that my boyfriend says he'll always see me as more feminine bc we have sex makes me want to cut off my skin. (Otherwise hes  chill with me being trans). At least my therapist is trying to talk sense into my mom but i feel hopeless. Whats the point if i have to wait years and years to be able to really be myself? Whats the point in living if im constantly uncomfortable and want to curl up inside myself?"
I want to die tonight,I wish I had done it year ago... I just want to stop being sad. I just want my ex back. I want to stop having syndromes causing constant muscle spasms...I can't do it anymore. We have enough pills for it.... it's so fucking tempting. I miss him so fucking much. I'm so alone.
I don't want to see 24,I am feeling so impulsive. Do I want to kill myself? Do I just want to cut? Or something in between? I literally have no idea. I've had it in my head that I don't want to make it to my 24th birthday. I need help.
recently just started to want to off myself,"idk man i just start drinking and just think how different i would be if i had to emotions towards anything. i go through my depression in cycles, i start at the beginning of the month out fine but i slide into it. i use alcohol to numb it. it leaves them the cycle continues. i honestly have a great life. i have a job, i have a roof over my head, i really shouldn't be complaining. but depression is a bitch. it mainly just comes from me being lonely and my lack of trust in people. i read some of others people's reasons for wanting to hurt/kill them selfs and they have honestly had the most sh**y luck in the world. then i think off my problems and realize i have nothing on them which makes me feel like more shit man idk. i feel like a bullet in the head would be the best"
Why won't it end,"I can't bring myself to do it, I just want to never wake up. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to do anything. I've been a miserable failure to everyone who knows me. I can't even keep my temper under control. Every time I snap I bawl my eyes out right after, I've been living in a roller coaster of emotions and it's just so draining. Nothing seems to be working, and nothing is important. Nothing I do or don't do will be important in the next 100 years, not even the next 10. We're just a small speck and I'm just a smaller dust particle in the grand scheme of things. I'm painfully below average and shitty at everything I try to do and idk I'm sick of it. I try to be better and it never works. I'm sick of being told I won't amount to anything, I know I won't, but there's no need to rub it in my face...I'm sorry for the short ramble I just needed to say something."
ugh,whatever I have to say is going to sound exactly like everyone else so there's no point in me even tryingI just feel a lack of motivation for anything and I'm extremely unhappy with where I am in life and I don't want to keep goingthe worst part is knowing that this will most likely get buried.  yet another one of my posts that goes unnoticed.
I just need to vent. Thank you.,"My father and mother would always fighting physically. My mother would take me out of school many times my whole school career to run away and i would miss days of school. Days later my mother and me would be back home kissing my father's feet. I see her get kicked by my father and I used to care but I cant wait for her to die. She takes her anger out on me for being a trans fag. I can't have friend because according to all my family members friends don't exist. It's cool tho because I don't have anyone anyways. I want to learn coding or anything for educational purposes but I can't go because according to my family I do drugs with all the friends I totally have. I'm failing all my classes and can't consentrate. I want to be an astrophysist or my life long dream that is not compatible with reality , an astronaut but I can't even pass science and math. My family does not apporve. All I can do is draw and not feel pain when the blade hits me. I'm useless. Mother is taking me away taking me to another state once again. I don't want to go back home if I leave. I want to kill myself but the same time I know that I should just work with what I have until I can leave but I would still have to take care of my diabetic family. Since I am a woman my word does not count in this household. I can only be draged. Im only someone people talk to and ignore and hit then tell sorry to afterwards. If i speak up i get threatened to be told no my father that part of the lgbt group. I teacher told me she would be here for me but I know I'll never talk to her because I can't. My mother sent me a counsler just to shame me for cutting myself. The cousler told me that I could tell her anything but if it's illegal the police ay get involved. I had to half lie and tell her that I punish myself and not the that  I get mild ptsd when I hear the chime of keys and a gate because that's the sound father made when he comes home. I want to killmyself because I'm on the road to failure anyways. No way anyone would want a loser friend. I can't relate to others. Others have depression yeah but who in heck would want to talk about that. Instead everyone talk about tv ,anime , sports , movies , music or games. I don't do any of those. I only plan things all day on my free time. I wake up with a feeling of dread hearing my mother smooching my father's face in the wee morning. I want to die kill me . If i were to die i would just smile. However , I know that since I want to die I know that I should just do whatever I want since nothing matter but still I can't get myself to just be myself. Im scared I just want to grow up and work and be independant. The universe are my only friends. They will always be there shining for me when all is dark. I can't kill myself because if I do I'll never see them again. I just want to die? or live?"
Short Question! I don't really know how to talk about suicide unless I'm anonymous on the internet.,"I kind of actually want to talk about it with someone. I really just don't want to die, but I don't want to live in pain, suffering and pointless struggle even more. Nobody knows how suicidal I am. Not my best friend. Or my parents or anybody at all. I'm really scared to even mention it. I'm not even sure what it'll achieve."
Lost my job and don't want to be homeless and sick,"I don't know what to do. I was homeless 14 years ago when I had cancer, but the social worker from the hospital put me in a shelter that knew I was sick.  I don't have anything like that now. I can't sleep on the sidewalk.  People are violent. Cops are violent.  I keep fear at bay by telling myself if I can't find something safe I will kill myself.  I am too sick to walk around outdoors.  I am diabetic and if I can't find food my mind stops working well.  I don't know what to do.  I have worn out the generosity of my friends and they are struggling themselves.  I came here (eastern PA) because a friend was going to take me in, then she didn't and my money is close to being used up.  So I don't know any of the local resources, before I was here I was on the West Coast.  I wish I could go back.  I'd walk into the woods a little way and be done with.  My brain isn't working well enough for me to save myself and I've been in a downward spiral ever since I lost my real job over a year ago.  Temping isn't going to keep me off the street.  I have no family, they hate queer people.  I don't know what to do.  I am exhausted. "
I think I'm a bad person,"Hi. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I have a pretty long history of depression and anxiety. I had a fight with my husband today. I had judged his actions as immoral, and after we talked about the issue some more, I realized that his actions no longer struck me as immoral.He was really hurt that I judged him. He told me that he would never judge me, and that now he realizes that I'm the kind of person who will judge him. I had to agree, because I just did judge him.I feel so horrible, realizing that I'm the sort of person who judges others. I never thought of myself that way, but now I have unignorable evidence that I am. I feel like the worst kind of person, and I hated myself for being so unkind.I feel like killing myself right now, but it's probably just temporary, and I don't really have any friends I feel I can reach out to. I don't want to melt down on my husband, because he says I sometimes use him as an emotional battery. Please, reach out to me.Thanks."
"Was in a porn video once when I was 19, two years later and I want to kill myself because of it","Happened when I was struggling with undiagnosed PTSD from a sexual assault. I got on meds and got therapy and was only in that industry for a couple months. I made one video and I didn't do anything except kiss her, but we were naked. I feel like I was using that and camming to take back control of my body. Now I completely regret it. I feel ashamed and every time this girl (who is still in the business) shares the video on her twitter I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I have tried to reach out as she used to be a very good friend, but she hasn't spoken to me since. I feel so disgusting. I feel hopeless. I know people from our highschool know about her so I'm sure they've seen the video. I honestly just want to kill myself. I am so fucking stupid. "
I've been neglected and thrown out into the deep water and I can't swim so if I don't make it painless and quick I'll drown anyways because I can't swim,"That's been my life. In January this year randomly no warning police show up. They throw me and my Dad out of our house for no reason. They had a proposed court order that was written by my moms lawyer to throw us out and somehow the police think its an order and no warrant they bust through our door and throw us out. They let my fake family into my house. My fake mom uncle brother and cousin. They came in and smashed up my house. Totally destroyed it. (have PTSD to a point where I hallucinate parts of the events) I was hiding in my room scared and I was on the phone with my Dads lawyer he was telling me to call the police he said this was outrageously illegal. I had such a hard time dialing 911 I never did because I was scared. Then suddenly they start pounding on my bedroom door. My fake brother and fake cousin both come in attack me (received a severe concussion i don't know why they were so...vile and aggressive they won what more did they want...) and they turn my room upside down. They stole what little money I had they could find. I'm a jobless 18 year old so $70 is a lot to take from me. I couldn't get a job because I was battling my anxiety disorder and I got fired from my other job for having it. For some reason its Semptember no justice in that situation and what I just found out today is really depressing. I'm living with my sister. I want to move out because her husband doesn't want me there and he's assaulted me twice. He's punched me in my face once out of the blue we weren't even talking and also shoved me into my room to shut me in there and I never really knew why I did that. I can't move out though yes I skipped a lot I've been separated from my Dad and I've been asking if he's ever found a new place for us to live... He hasn't found anything. He just revealed to me because of thousands upon thousands of dollars that was stolen from our house that day. He's struggling to pay $500 a month rent where he is living currently. IDK Y I haven't received justice. I doubt what my Dad is doing to fix it. The NH DOJ said that we would and the court said what happened that day in January was never ordered to happen. I don't know what I am supposed to do I'm headed for the god damn street at the age of 18 because of corruption in my state. (My brother in law says by November 2018 I'm out of this place whether I have a place to go to or not.) I'm still a high school freshman because I was homeschooled and my family split up caused that all to crash and both my parents oppose public school so I was forced out of school. I wanted to do it... what was I supposed to do... I didn't know how to do anything without support from a parent. My Dads solution was to get a GED when I needed it. I have no opportunities and no coach. I have an anxiety disorder. I have a broken up hateful family. I don't know what to do. I do have dreams I want to be a dentist or a lawyer. They both take 8 years though and as I do either of those jobs I want to be a musician/film maker and hopefully I can make those two my life. All of it has a theme behind it. My passion is to help people really. Music is a powerful healer and film is a great distraction to pain of any kind. If I become a Lawyer I want to help people bullied by criminals and corruption. As a dentist thats like physically healing people and dentistry is still something I'm really scared of. So I want to be one because I feel like I can heal people of that sort of pain. I guess its important to remember my dreams. Its just so hard to see any of those a reality. I don't know how to start at all. I can't go to college... I've been beaten to the ground and I've been so neglected. idk what I'm supposed to do. I have no parents to help me. I'm actually headed to the streets. I'm a fucking high school freshman...I just wrote a suicidal note. I plan on doing it before October 29th.. if not that than Christmas. Idk if you can blame me for it but I fucking hate Christmas. I really... I hate Christmas. No family to spend it with and no reason to be happy. idk if its selfish to say but the more happy people around me are the worse I feel about being the way that I am. Honestly, I just see no way out. What am I as an 18-year-old kid in his first year of high school supposed to do about facing homelessness? With an unsupportive parent and one who can't support me. I just have no teacher and no place to call home and work my way up with something to stand on.  "
I'm sorry this is the second time I'm writing here today.,"I think I just got pushed over the edge. I'm 16. I've been depressed since I was in 3rd grade. It was kind of in the back of my mind until 4th grade when I got hospitalized for the first time. I met this guy in 8th grade. He was my first boyfriend. He constantly mentally abused me and guilt tripped me into doing things that I wasn't ready for. I've never told anyone this before. I remember one day he called me Over to his dorm. He said he was gonna kill him self because I wasn't answering him. I went over and he was waiting at the door for me. He had a pair of scissors and he started cutting his hands up in front of me. Over the next few months he'd keep telling me I was useless and that He didn't know why he was still with me. Then one day he convinced me to in away from school with him. And I did. The police found us next day. I was in the hospital for the next 4 days because of hypothermia. That summer was the worst because I knew everything was my fault. It's been just over a year and a half since all of that. At the beginning of 9th grade I met a person. This person made me so happy. They helped me through everything. They loved me and I loved them. We were together for 6 months. Then last month they decided it of no where they didn't want me anymore. I told my friends about it and I kept saying I wanted to kill my self cause everytime I've kept everything inside I've ended up going through with plans. I'm just too stupid and they never work. I just end up in the emergency room (after the last attempt I have permanent liver damage). I'm putting my friends through too much. They spend too much time worrying about me. But I want to tell them what's happening with me and how I feel but if I do then they'll worry more. And if I'm gone then they won't worry at all cause they won't have to. I guess I'm writing here because I can't go to the people I actually want to talk to about myself. I'm just hoping someone reads this and might be able to help a little. Cause I don't wanna die. But at the same time I do more than anything else. And it's not like the feeling goes away. I'm afraid to die. But I want to die. I lost the most important person in my life last month. They'd stuck with me trough everything up until august. They stuck with me when I was was in the hospital after overdosing. They waited for me afterwards but now they're gone. They were the only person I felt comfortable going to whenever I was about to kill myself. I guess I just want someone to talk me out of it. Last time I tried to kill myself it was because nobody talked me out of it. It was because I didn't go to anyone about it. But now I have no one to go to. I just want to be happy again. What makes all of this shit worse is that I remember what it was like to be happy everyday and enjoy living. Being able to get out of bed. And now I'm sitting here everyday being yelled at by my parents. They keep saying ""what the fucks wrong with you why won't you get up. Is t that depression shit again? Just suck it up. Everyone gets sad but we all just suck it up. Go to school"" I can't go to school anymore. I just sit in the bathroom and try to cry silently so no one notices. Please someone respond. I want help. I know I'm going to do something tonight if I don't talk to someone.This post kinda elaborates on one of the issues I've been dealing with from my earlier post "
Music sparks it.,"Everything's been good. Had a rough bit a while back and would post on here on seperate accounts just to vent, but things have been better. So I got the bright Idea to chill outside in my hammock tonight, and listen to some music from back in my bad days, and now it's all coming back. I wanna die, not link suicidal, just don't wanna continue. Sometimes I wanna ruin my life, like just start doing hard addictive drugs and ruin my relationships, and just go awol and ruin my life. Just bring destruction to the chaos and I'll be complete. But I just don't understand... How do yall keep the courage and move on? Like just chug along with all this extra baggage dragging you down and drowning you?"
My attempt,"Saturday night, that's when it happened. The whole process was very impulsive, I had no last thoughts; nothing serious. I took maybe 9  or so anti seizure pills. The last thing I remember was laying on my stairs, looking at my cat and thinking how amazing he looks, how nature is beautiful. Suddenly I have obscured flashes of consciousness. I saw an IV needle in my arm, I saw my dad, with long hair and a purple plaid sweater. Darkness, then light again. The nurse walks in and informs my parents that they had found marijuana in my system, it was no surprise to them. For whatever reason, it didn't worry me. I'd say it's because I was about to fucking die. Suddenly I wake up in my bed, the familiar room in which I've spent so much time becoming who I am. This room
Is me, and I am this room. The familiarity of such a setting, along with my mother and step dad around, gave me enough comfort to forget what had just happened. As I ate my breakfast, I convinced them to leave me alone, slowly coming to. By the time it had been noon, I was myself again. But this time, I was much happier. I was who I really wanted to be - Monday, September 18th, 2017"
"I'm 16 years old, and THIS YEAR is my ""win or die"" year.","If this year does not live to be successful, if I don't not end up look any better than I do right now, if I do  have my dreams accomplished, and if everything goes to total shit (as it is right now), I will go to the mall with my mom one day and I will run & jump from the highest floor. This has been thoroughly plannedIf this year  happen to be somewhat successful, and I end up looking better, and I somehow end up taking someone to the junior ball with me, and if I end up making actual friends that respect me, I  die.I'm not saying I'm suicidal, I really don't want I kill myself. In fact, I've never hurt myself or cut myself not even once. I'm terrified of death. But as I said, this is my  year. If I fail this year, then it is ultimately guaranteed that the rest of my life shall continue that way. I am better off dead. And when I say that, I am truly serious."
My life is hell,"I'm in hell. Job sucks. Family sucks. Depression sucks. I'm going crazy. No one cares. I'm better off dead. People get over it. I mean, people die all the time. Why should I be any different?"
A letter to myself.,"Dear Self.You like to think that your problems began on Christmas Eve, of the year 1993 when you were raped, beaten and strangled. You were a seven year old boy then. The truth of the matter is is that the problems began shortly after conception. That genetic mishap that was placed inside your genetic sequencing, that ticking time bomb that inevitably went off at the age of fourteen, when you tried to commit suicide for the first time. You stole your father's pistol from his closet, loaded it, and pressed it to your temple. It failed to fire because your father was a failure at maintaining his guns properly. Strangely, upon remembering this, I seem to find it a fitting metaphor for how you have turned out. While your father was a failure at maintaining his guns, you have become the same failure at maintaining personal relationships, your work duties, your own fatherly responsibilities. All of which have led to other suicide attempts, which predictably, have ended in failure. These are only a few of the many fuckups you have endured in your thirty-one years in life. You have subsequently shown that you are incapable of interacting with people like a normal human being. Remember that night where you became everything you ever hated, and attempted to rape that guy? Another failed suicide attempt followed that little endeavour. You vowed to give up sex after that altogether, swearing to become a better person. You failed at that as well. Instead, you married the person you slept with next. Sired two children. They may love you dearly, but she hates you. You know she does. The way she glares at you when she thinks you're not looking. The fact she now refuses to sleep in the same bedroom as you, and becomes physically sick if you touch her, The fact you're on the road many weeks at a time providing a pathetic excuse for a living for her and your two kids. For fuck sakes, the power has been turned off more times than you can count because you can't make enough money to keep it on. You've failed as a provider. You have failed as a husband. You failed at Marriage.Worst of all, you've failed at being a good father.You've missed so much. Your son's first words and steps. Your daughter's first days of First, second, and third grade. You're worse than your father ever was, and HE had the audacity to call you a liar when you cried to him after being raped. You're fucking worthless. Look at you. Self medicating in alcohol and weed, masturbating twice a day constantly chasing that temporary high that will ultimately take the crushing weight of having fucked up every good thing that could have possibly come your way.To your credit, you'd never change your children. They're the only thing that gives you hope. But maybe... just maybe... they'd be happier if you weren't around. One less white trash, confused bisexual dad in the world to screw them up forever and ever couldn't hurt that much, could it? I mean, look at yourself. You're deeply unhappy. You're mentally scarred, terrified of everything, barely able to take care of yourself. Ultimately, you will die alone, some nurses' or doctor's burden that they'd be annoyed to be obligated to try and help. You're growing older, fatter, sadder, and yet still hold steadfast to the desperate need to try and hide from all of this.That's why I needed to write this letter. This post for everyone to see. You've been considering ending it again. Possibly taking someone with you. Despite the treatments for your steadily declining mental health, you find yourself back in the depths of the darkness and it's far worse than it ever has been before. Violent urges, thoughts of self harm and suicide, all of these things are piling up on you like an avalanche and you feel as though there is no one to talk to. No one cares to listen anymore because you're such a fucking crybaby about your mental problems. It's cost you so many friends and even family members. Your wife won't even bother to listen to you anymore. You are truly alone in the darkness and it is consuming you this time, your inner demons finally winning out despite a decade of fighting like hell against them. You could tell your doctor about it, but he's already certain the medication that you're on is THE THING that will make you normal again.As if you were ever normal. I really don't know how to end this letter. I guess things like this don't ever end. I'll always be that voice in your head, criticizing you, telling you what you already know about yourself but refuse to acknowledge, baring the truth in all it's naked glory for you to try and shy away from. I will be with you until the end. Which needs to come sooner, rather than later. "
My life so far.,"I can't reach out to anyone so I'm trying anonymity. This will be a long post. Writing this out might bring me solace of some kind. Twenty one years ago I was born to an alcoholic, pothead punk of a father and the mother who was suckered into the ""bad boy"" routine because her father was mayor and mother a teacher. My mother was nineteen, a freshman in college, my father, doing nothing with his life at the time. Before long my mother decided it would be best to drop out of school. Father was a mess, spent all his money on various drugs and alcohol. My very first memory I have, as far back as I can remember, is the hole in my entryway. My room was on the opposite side of our C shaped house, at the bottom right apex of the ""C."" Straight across the long hallway that lead past a bathroom, the den, the living room, kitchen, dining room, kitchen, and finally my parents room. There was two exits. One about 20 feet from my bedroom door, one about fifteen from my parents door. I remember my father coming home, and hearing my mother quietly whispering to him. I cracked my door open and stared down the long hallway to watch my father towering over my mother, probably drunk, high, maybe both. He was holding his head and she raised her tone slightly before smashing a hole about the size of my head into the entryway wall. She was quiet and went into her room. He followed shortly after. I never saw my father hit my mother, but I would see occasional bruises. She covered them well. I don't know how she felt, she tried to be positive to me. I was a very confused child. We lived in the middle of nowhere, deep in the woods, no religion, no church. It was just the three of us and the woods. My mother got a job from her father. It paid well and was enough to barely support us. My mother racked up a large amount of debt keeping the house afloat until my father was able to get his act together. I spent my time outside most of the time during the summers. Doing my best to avoid my father. He was very uncaring, but terrifying when angry. At this point, I'm five years old. My dad wouldn't quite hit me, he'd chase me down the hall to my room until I fell over and cried. My mother would scold him, but he held himself together due to my age. The nights were filled with my night terrors. I had very vivid dreams my whole life. Still do.I had a baby brother by the time I was six, and a sister shortly after. I didn't realize how different things were until I lost the title of ""only child."" Fast forward to fourteen. We were moving from my small C shaped home in the woods to the town me and my siblings went to school in. My father hit me regularly by this point, but I'd rather not dwell on it. By this point my father was very cold and unreceptive to my attention. I was to blame. I messed up their twenties. I didn't really believe those words, just kind of thought them in the back of my head. Most of my childhood I spent avoiding my parents, exploring the woods since my parents lost all interest in me by the time I was able to be independent and I had siblings. After we moved, the money tensions rose drastically. My mother lost her empathy and had a very short temper. She wouldn't hit me, just scream. About three months after we moved in, I got in an argument with my father while I was doing the dishes and he choked me and stuck my head into the water. My mother screamed at him and I tried my best to retain my composure. My dad took off in the car, a regular occurrence by age 14. My mother was crying by the door and when I came by to apologize she screamed at me, unloading 14 years of stress onto my shoulders. How she racked up so much debt and couldn't be independent. How I ruined her marriage, her dreams, her chances, her life by being born. I left the house.I came back about a week later. I spent some time with my best (and only) friend. We'll call him Brad. Brad was tall and skinny, blonde hair and green eyes. Charismatic, quick witted, and egotistical. He was a leader, and I was his follower. We met in band class in the 8th grade and were best friends from day one. We raised hell together. He was popular and knew how to word everything perfectly to make the best of the situation. Our freshman year he dated the head cheerleader and sat with the rest of the seniors. He was that guy. I lived in his shadow. He always came back for me, though. We were like blood.After regaining my confidence he planted the seeds of independence in my mind. For the next four years of my life, I spent my life locked away and isolated from my family. They watched movies without me, ate dinner without me, and went out without me. Lived without me. It was almost a nuisance seeing me walk through the door after getting out of school. They'd scream at everything and anything. I just gave up and hid in my room as soon as I got home so they couldn't yell. I started my first job at 15, and worked as much as possible. I like to think I'm intelligent, but never felt school was the place to make my mark. I stayed quiet, living in Brad's shadow and trying to accumulate real world experience. I spent so much time living in my own head I never really looked outward to others. When I finally did, everything was an analytical act. Attempting to emulate Brad. The first case was with a girl I met in 8th Grade. Her name will be Faith. Faith had a lot of... Well.. Faith. Her family was poor and close knit, incredibly religious. She took a liking to me. She had bobbed dark hair, dark eyes, a tight cut hourglass waist, wide hips, and tits the size of my head. My adolescent self was completely intrigued. We talked on the phone daily. This continued throughout the school year until the summer came. I was excited to finally be able to spend time with my girlfriend and spend some of the money I had saved from working on someone. She told me she had to spend the summer up north with some family. We still talked daily, and it was good for me. Talking. Broke me out of my shell. She finally came back at the end of the summer, during our small town's fair. I waited all night for her.
She was there, with someone else. I gave up on women for a short time and tried to focus on work. That winter, at a parade, I ran into another young girl who I had never seen before. Short, with long black hair. Skinny, but curvy, with beautiful eyes and an amazing smile. We ran into each other crossing the road and just clicked. I repeated the process, calling her daily and staring to feel something for myself again. Summer came, and I was ready to finally spend my free time with her. She moved to North Dakota.
I waited a year, still calling her every day. Her parents eventually divorced and she moved back with her mother, at the time of the fair. I spent half the night waiting for her, and she showed up with her friend, who left shortly after. I felt alive every moment I spent alone with her. I was so happy. I finally felt normal. We wandered around the town after the fair and started a fire in some random persons fire pit. We pulled up lawn chairs and stared at the stars. I held her hand. I felt so alive. We kissed, and she told me that she slept with her abusive ex the day before I saw her, and the guilt was too much, through her tears. I stood up and walked home without saying anything. I didn't want to let myself get any more attached. That woman threw me for a loop of self harm and loathing myself for about a year. Things were still terrible at home, but I tried to keep any interactions to a minimum between school and work. I left whenever I felt like it. They didn't care where I was or what I did. I was like a ghost. The fall after that fair, during the beginning of the year, I met someone. Not necessarily someone.. More ""the one."" Brad had a friend he used to live by, who we'll call Alex. Alex's  parents owned a popular restaurant in town. He picked me and Brad up in this new car his parents bought him, and he brought some girl he liked with a bunch of her friends to this dance. No one was really going with anyone, but it was obvious who was into who. Everyone slid off into dances after we got there, except me, Brad's friend, and her. The one. ""J."" Alex asked her to dance, she refused. He stomped off into the crowd, and we sat at the table and talked. I managed to get her number and a (short and uneventful) dance. Fast forward to the deep fall. I called J up spontaneously after about a month of silence and asked if she wanted to go for a walk around town. Ironically, J lived a block behind me and one house over. We wandered through town, watching the leaves fall, telling each other the deepest thoughts we had. She asked if I wanted to watch this illusionist event that was going on that night, to which I eagerly accepted. The event was interesting until the magician started using magic as a metaphor for Christianity, to which I lost a large portion of my interest. She mumbled something about how lame it turned out, which was eye opening in such a religious conservative area that we were born. We became super close. We dated for about a year before a mutual break. That year, I focused on my work, senior year. I had an internship and two jobs outside of school and was attending a skill center for business management. Brad called me on my way home from work and told me that Alex and J were dating. I hung up without a word. I spent some time thinking, and thought maybe it was for the best. She was perfect, but that's not something to concern myself with. I just tried to stay friends. Support my best ""girl friend."" Alex had anger issues. He reminded me of my father. The ""bad boy"" who was spoiled, with lots of money. They ended up breaking up after he tried to pressure her into sex. He followed her everywhere, even smashed in a locker at school when she ghosted him. I tried to support her, and got her back on her feet. Not long after, she started dating an older guy from the town over. I was constantly invited to parties by J, hosted by her boyfriend. Brad had faded into the popular crowd and lost connection with me. So, in hopes of having a social life, I followed. At this point in my life my parents rarely spoke, in passing. I got a call from my mother while I was at my internship. My grandmother had died of cancer. She was sick for three years, and married to the inspiration of my life (grandfather), and the most kind woman I've ever met. The nightmares still haven't stopped to this day. She was the light in the darkness of my family tree. Compassionate, caring, always listening. What I imagine ""family"" is supposed to feel like. My grandfather started seeing another woman about a year after. I can't look at him the same.After she started college, J and Alex broke up. Distance, she said. He didn't look at her the same. I fell back in love with her and confessed everything to her. She came back every weekend to see me. Things were good. I graduated at 17 and was accepted to a nearby university to hers, for mechanical engineering. I was convinced to become independent and finally sever the dead ties with my family. Be my own person, build my own life. On my 18th birthday, we both lost our virginity. J was that girl that comes by once in a lifetime. She spoke softly and compassionately. She was so supportive and kind. She was perfect in every way. The perfect girlfriend. We ended up growing slightly apart due to my engrossing in school. She cheated on me. Or, that's how it felt. We were taking ""a break"" and she started seeing someone else. I quit school and took a production welding job at a factory my aunt was a human resources manager at, bought a 2010 Ford focus, bought and furnished an apartment in our hometown, and rekindled the fire between us. That was the biggest mistake of my life. She lived with me on the weekends, went to school during the week. I worked 80 hours a week, made great money, but had no time. I worked with some less than classy people. I got into Vicodin and started drinking as much as I could get. Smoking constantly. I went downhill fast. My temper shortened, and spent time at home during the weekends sleeping as soon as I got there. My body was exhausted. She still tried to be kind. I think I felt like I had it all, that she was there for good, so I vented onto her once. Unloaded. Things got worse. The Vicodin warped to pill popping. Things worsened. I came into work when it was dark, and left when it was dark. After constant fighting about 8 months into the new job, I drive my car head on into a semi at 70. I didn't even break anything. I blew it off and blamed it on a semi swerving into my lane. I bought a pistol from a sketchy friend for $325. I went into the woods where my old home was and planned on killing myself in a drunken, angry, confused stupor. J called. Told me how great her day at college was. How she helped these kids (early education major). Her voice was filled with love. I put the gun away. I know I was fucked up because when she came home and found the gun she kept asking if I would hurt myself, or her. I always denied it sharply. She didn't know about my car. Eventually I got in an argument with my supervisor and quit that day. J stayed with me until the power went out in my apartment. I kept making excuses. Lying. So many lies. She left and we fought, and then I was alone. I tried to do it so many times, tried to end it. We had done everything together, and I selfishly built my life around her. I was hopeless.
After about five months of turmoil I got a job as a maintenance person/toolmaker at a nearby factory. I got my shit together, quit all the pills and drinking, and really tried to do things right. I coaxed her back again. Things were perfect. I made her family dinner. That's when she told me they would never trust me after the last four years. I was taken aback. It got to the point where it was me or them. She chose them. She called me crying in June and told me it was over. I haven't seen her since. She deleted and blocked me on all social media. I never see her anymore. The only thing I had was a casual dress she left here. I left it on her parents doorstep about a month ago.I kept thinking I'd be fine, and even dated another girl a few months later. I took her out to dinner and we got drunk in Canada. It's a long story. Good time. She moved across state. I left her. It was for the best. My life slowly fell back apart. I started to realize how alone I was when Brad moved to South Carolina. After we graduated I spent every waking moment of free time I could with that bastard, and now he was leaving. It's been a few months. My apartment is trashed. I don't necessarily feel like I need J or Brad to feel whole, but I've been steadily feeling more and more empty. I was just told last week that I have a month to find a new job. My car died. I'm $5,000 or so in debt from the five months I wasn't working after quitting production welding. I have $158.47USD to my name. I'm feeling alone and helpless, so empty. I haven't spoken with anyone outside of work in months. The one person I went through everything with is gone, and my best friend is gone. The one family member I had is dead. My nights are filled with night terrors. I've lost 40lbs. I can't reach out anymore, I'm going crazy inside my head, Brad won't even respond to my texts. He's moved on. I wish I could. This is my cry for help.please help me"
I'm just so confused to be honest,"I honestly feel it would be best for everyone if I died, yet I cant bring myself to do it. I finally feel I can say everyone would be better off if I died yet I'm too cowardly to actually do something about it, even for people who I care about most, I just dont get it to be honest."
I tried... but why couldn't it just work?,"On Friday night, I tried to hang myself. I won't get explicit about details, per the rules, but after blacking out, I woke up on the floor. I don't know how much time passed. My entire body was shaking, and I had the most excruciatingly painful headache I've ever had - it was nothing like anything I had ever experienced in my life before. My head is still hurting now and I just want it to go away already. My girlfriend told me she doesn't feel in love me anymore because of long distance, my depression is getting worse than ever before, something's going wrong with my brain and I'm struggling in school, and I just feel so alone. Suicide seems like the only option now. I'm trying to talk to my girlfriend and convince her that we need to work it out and help ourselves, but she won't listen to what I have to say. I'm so close to trying again, and I plan on succeeding. I've already got my note typed and printed and signed from Friday, and I don't know where else to go but here. Thank you reddit for listening to me when no one else will. "
My time to go has come,The last three days have been me laying in bed just wondering if I should kill myself or not. I think my time has come. I want to jump from a parking garage. Nothing seems worth it anymore. Words don't mean anything. I don't care about anything. The only thing is I know that it would destroy my parents and brother....but I can't live in this pain anymore.
People's reactions are extremely petty,Just went for a job preview seminarAnd people still treat as what is happening to me as something normal and they even joked that i may be nervous. When i already told alot of people i get sick quite easily.
The fact she doesn't care hurts,"I'm going to try to go through with it, I have the knife now. If I'm not too much of a fucking pussy I'll slit my throat, I don't care how much it hurts because I am already feeling too much pain as days go on. "
I can say I mean it but then again,"Who's gonna care, I'm always suicidal but I'm too much of a weak idiot to do anything about itI lost all my friends"
What's the point of it all??,"I'm so tired of being so stressed all the time. I have so many assignments and I commute so far to school I just want to fucking give up. What am I going to do with this degree, more than likely absolutely nothing since apparently, no one will hire me without an internship. Even if I did get a job what's the point then?? make money until I die? Live in utter misery? People say college is the best time of your life, for me it's been nothing but misery. I have no friends, I have no way to make friends since I live so far from campus I can't stay late, and I just hate my classes and my professors. I just want to die. I don't see a point. My professors are all assholes, the people in my classes are all rich without a care in the world, and my workload is insane. My favorite band is a sellout like all my previous favorite bands. I really thought these guys were going to do something special. Turns out they got a taste of fame and decided to just sell out. Is it too much to ask for a band that actually cares about what they put out to fans??? Sugar coated bullshit is just that. Bullshit.Fuck. I hate that I go through these phases where I love everything for 2 years and I set goals for myself and everything is great, then I just hate everything. I hate my favorite colors, music, career choices, majors, all my previous purchases, anything and everything. I just lose it. this happens every two years on the dot and I hate it about myself. I hate everything about myself."
Danger of calling Suicide Hotline,"If I call the suicide hotline, will I be put into a database... will they call the police or somebody to ""watch"" me. I really want to call but if they do more than just talk to you I will not call."
I feel so empty,"I feel like an empty shell of a person. It doesn't feel like anything matters because for me it just doesn't. I have no interest in anything and to be honest my entire life feels like it was a waste, like in the end I haven't done anything to amount to being a real person with interests, memories, relationships, and lessons learned. I feel so lost because of this. I've always felt like I was a pretty big loser since around middle school but I never actually made any changes to fix that and I think my life has been a waste because of it. Idk. I just feel so empty, and it feels like I always will because that emptiness comes from a pretty empty life; wasted time I can never get back to develop myself into a real person. The very fact that I feel like I have to develop into a real person this late in life is so discouraging it makes me want to end it."
Is living even worth it anymore?,"Right now I am coming to terms with the fact that i probably have a lot of underlying mental health issues as well as suffering from severe depression, i used to think it was just depression, but i have noticed traits of OCD and possibly even ASD in myself which may have been missed when i was born. I have been sexually abused as a child, bullied and picked on for no apparent reasons in high school which lead to me using porn as a coping mechanism, and that came with a whole host of its own problems, I became socially isolated save for a group of people which has withered down to one. When high school ended I went to college, and ended up dropping out of 2 courses. I know that I am a disappointment to my father who had high hopes for me when i was younger and constantly compares me to my older cousins who are successful real estate agents and entrepeneurs, My peers also have way better social lives than I and are moving into university. Meanwhile I have worked a retail job all summer to pay for another college course, and have been underpaid so i dont even know if i will be able to afford it. I have had suicidal thoughts or just thoughts of death in general everyday for about 4 years and have recently begun tying nooses in my room and either staring at them or putting them around my neck. My mum has actually found one of these under my bed and hasnt said anything.
Looking back on my life so far it has been unremarkable to say the least, and at the most it is a series of unfortunate events that will probably get worse as time goes on, I cannot remember the last time i was truly happy and I refuse to realise it will ever get better. I dont believe in God anymore due to how bad my life and the world in general is but if there is indeed such a thing then I believe that they just hated me and decided to make my entire life as miserable as it could possibly be, infact I was actually born caesarean because I was facing the wrong way in the womb, so maybe i wasnt meant to be born. Anyway sorry for the rant."
I'm contemplating suicide. Again.,I don't know why exactly... But I feel trapped in every aspect of my life. I love my husband. I have a nice job (and income). I have a wonderful house... But I'm not where I wish I was in my life right now. I'll turn 29 next year and I cant help but wonder... Is this everything life can offer? Is this It? Yesterday I almost OD. Took more Prozac and clonazepam than I should. But I woke up today... With the same alarm clock. As an ordinary day. Not a single person knows that I almost did It yesterday... i'm ashamed and afraid. I've been trough this before and this time I dont know If Im strong enough because honestly... What is the point? There isnt. Everything is plain ordinary.
Sick of this,I'm not sure where I should even post this anymore. Its just been so hard. I feel like I'm trapped inside my body and it makes me feel really suicidal I don't want to live like this any more I want to kill myself every day. Is an ED and dysphoria.
typical psychosis,"hey reddit,
i heard taping a million times on a keyboard can make you lose about 0,01pound, so we're going for a weightloss.my name's wyvh, obviously not my real name. i'm a 19 french winy person that apparently sees everything on the dark side.. or just seeing the things as they are.i don't really need.. 'help'. you need help when you want to get out of this situation and have a greater life and move on. what i need to do here is to pass on a message before i pass away myself. there are two mysteries in life; humanity and.. humanity's bullshit. the difference ? humanity's mystery is about how such a nice species of love and mutual aidness became a society-system focused on ego and properties. i don't think i'm teaching anything new here.saying my name and my age wasn't really an introduction, so.. well, as another broken man wandering on the internet seeking for some attention (not everyone is like this, i must admit), i guess i can tell more about myself without risking anything. i'll avoid the long-ass story of thousands words and do a quick list of it;-i've been schizophrenic and bipolar for more than 8 years now, 5 years of depression if not more
-raped 30 times in the changing room of my middle school, by the same boys
-abused and raped by one of my brothers during my childhood
-abusive and violent father that now drinks quite a lot
-depressive mother that cries every evening in the kitchen, and trust me i'm doing my best to help her
-friendless, lost my only life best friend in middle school, he hang himself thanks to his wonderful shitty familyhere's the hing. i wanted to die since the first time i've been raped in MS. and even more when i learned about my bf's death. i was still thinking, ""move on, it's okay""; fuck this. but i don't have a life, seriously. life is something you enjoy and feel; i'd say it's more like hell; endless pain. i keep hearing voices, seeing things that drive me crazy every time. medicine ? doesn't work, i keep taking them and make my parents believe it works (after all we've tried), but eh, i love pretending to be fine, i'm good at acting apparently.i'm tired. tired of seeing all these kids whining because they've got an untold exam tomorrow, tired of being judged in my back in class by some random kids because i'm ""too white"", ""he never speaks"", ""vampire"", ""gayass"", ""he has no friend lol""; well, fuck you all. if those kids at least understood what the others went through, maybe they'd judge less and focus more on helping and loving, but that's how our generation is, isn't it ?
i'm starting to see that i'm reaching the million words ! no, seriously, sorry for being so long, but this might be the last time i'm writing something about my life.i've told all this to a ""friend"" but all he's doing is 'Writing with a cap at the beginning, a beautiful dot at the end' with pointless tips, such as ""go check a therapist"" or ""life isn't simple"", ""stop that sarcasm"" in a mean way; well, you get the kind of ""friend"". that friend that thinks he's leader of everything, with his blonde head and beautiful face. i don't hate him, i just don't understand how someone can be blinded by such a naive perception of life and society.all my life i've been helping the others, reassuring them, listening to the girlies complain about their ""hard homework and life"" with a ""sent from my iphone X imsorichmarryme"" at the end of each text. i hate you all, but i love you so much for having such a pretty face and a voice that could make me believe that i'm actually being appreciated by someone and that my active agoraphobia and foot travellings to the high school with extremely high anxiety and stress are worth it. i can't go outside if there are more than 3 people without feeling anxious, without hearing voices that tell me how beautiful i am -sarcasm, got it ?- and talking and talkAGAJN just talking, talking. and when i can hear the people around, all i hear is ""ur my bae"" or ""omg i wake up at 8am tomorrow helpme i got 3 hours of class i can't take it anymore"" well darling, maybe you have issues aswell and i can't judge you with just a few words and a look on your pretty face, but you at least have a chance to be able to go to school because i can't. i stopt going to high school because i couldn't handle it, not even a hour. now i'm writing on this average computer while trying to mod GTA V that my mom kindly offered and seeing that they can't fucking make a mod without bugs on it. sorry lol.anyway. feels like a story you'd tell to yourself in your head, and i'm glad I could put words on it. now, a thought's going through my mind; how to make a death appear as an accident to make sure my mom's the least depressed about my death ?tldr; 19 years old homosexual bipolar schizophrenic seeking attention trying to convince himself death is the only solution while he can't think about any other way out "
Morbid curiosity,"I see so many people angry at their parents for suicides, understandably. I also see so many parents that believe it's better not to leave the children to suffer mother or fatherless so they ""take""'the kids with them. A screwed up logic but in some way it makes sense. If your parent completed suicide when you were young, have you ever thought ""at least they weren't so selfish as to take me also?"" "
Hating college and suicidal again,I recently started college here at Akron 3 hours away from my home. I don't drive so I'm pretty much stuck up here. I thought I would love it here the new environment and a way to make myself a new me. So far it's been the exact opposite I'm in a frat so that's cool but my classes for my major (nursing) are just crazy hard and Idk if I should switch majors or not or what to do. Idk if I even wanna be this far away from home anymore. I had major depressive disorder and anxiety and slight OCD racing thoughts mostly. I was really excited to start nursing and become a pychiatric nurse when I graduate but from where I am now that may never happen. Every day I am always anxious about either my social life or studying 4 hours a day or whatever else may happen. Lately I've just been laying in bed thinking of what to write in a note. And falling asleep thinking of when and how to end it all. I've been suicidal before and thought about it a lot really it has never left the back of my mind for 4 years. I guess I'm just bummed because I have barely any friends and having just a hard time. This summer me and my friends really became brothers and they all stayed together at local college because they don't have the money to come to a actual university but maybe they made the right decision. Idk what to think or say to my mom. Because I quit everything in life and I don't wanna quit college to. If anyone wants to talk please comment or pm me if you have experienced the same thing I am. I'm not very good at explaining things in text.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.,"I feel like I should read other posts and help support them before posting, but that compulsion is probably how I ended up where I am. I need a place to vent. I don't know if anyone will even read this, but I guess this is my cry for help or whatever.I'm sick, I have an illness. Doctors don't know what's wrong. I am on medication, but it makes me sick in other ways. I'm in pain nearly every day, I have nausea and/or vomiting nearly every morning. I have hunger pains but no appetite, when I put food in my mouth it makes me want to vomit. I've lost weight and I was already underweight. Now I look like a skeleton and none of my clothes fit, plus everything feels uncomfortable anyway.I try so hard to remain positive and optimistic, I try to be hopeful and keep on making doctors appointments, trying different treatments, from medicinal to therapeutic to psychosomatic. Sometimes it seems like things are getting better, but it never lasts. Now I'm typing this between sobbing and vomiting.I can't enjoy life the way I want, I can't go see friends or hang out cuz I'm always sick. My old social hobbies are totally neglected. I can't get or keep a job. I have to call in sick or go home sick all the time. I'm in debt from medical bills because I have no insurance and no job. Luckily I get alimony, and my family is supportive, but I hate asking them for money. I hate having to depend on others.Leaving my ex was awful. But then I met someone, and I thought everything was going to be okay again. We helped support each other, we both have chronic ailments and can commiserate and understand where no one else can. I felt a kind of strong, supportive love that I didn't think existed.However, that's over now. And it's killing me. It's my choice, because I know it won't work out in the end, we have a major incompatible difference, and we both know it's the right decision, but it still kills me.She has no one, no support. I just took the last bit of support she has. We still live together, and every day is misery. I hear her sobbing. We try to pretend the death of the relationship isn't killing us both constantly. I inadvertently hurt her, further, too, because I'm an idiot.I feel like a failure. I feel hopeless. I'm sick of being sick. I'm sick of medicine. I'm sick of hurting everyone who loves me. I'm sick of disappointing everyone. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to exist. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to be alive anymore.Even my poor dog just peed himself because he's terrified of my sobbing. This isn't a new habit. I'm even hurting my poor dog because I can't get my shit together. Honestly, if not for him I dunno if I could get out of bed in the morning..."
It's definitely Monday that's for sure.,"I've posted here before on other throwaways and idk, I just kinda want someone to talk to? Is that okay? I just feel so numb and drained and just dead. This morning my train almost (and I mean within a foot) hit a truck that tried to go around the gates. My best friend and I got into an argument that has honestly been coming for a while. I feel like I maybe deserved it. I'm not sure if we are even friends anymore. And I have an assignment worth 25% of my grade due tomorrow that I'm not done with. Oh, and I'm having second thoughts about my career choice because it happens every 2 years and this is nearly exactly the 2-year mark from when I decided last time. Maybe if I wasn't such a complete and utter shithead I could have a decent circle of friends and a life. I keep thinking everything is on me, I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have that opinion, I shouldn't go there,  I should do what my friend wants,  I should keep my mouth shut, agreeing is easier than disagreeing and having lost another friend. What happened to having a conversation about what we disagree over? I'm just so over trying so hard and trying to express myself only to be told I'm a shitty person."
Should i go inpatient again,"I was inpatient in May and didn't make use of any of the resources they have me.. I totally regret it.I moved and no longer have those resources. I'm sure you've seen me post at least monthly. I'm not an immediate risk to myself at this very moment, but I'm going to take time off from school to get better.I worry if I don't do inpatient I'll get bad again and attempt. I've thought about doing it just so I don't have to deal with this process on my own"
They say it get's better but it only gets worse.,"I can't do this anymore, every time I get close to even getting better it all crashes and burns after a matter of weeks. It's just a downward spiral since 2015."
Tired of this life,"I have a disability (legally blind) and I'm tired of this life. Everytime I try to change or grow or get better I get judged and treated as ""the blind guy"". I'm so sick of putting up with it for so long and my vision is only going to get worse. Feels like there's no hope. Nobody is going to ever treat my seriously. Nobody is ever going to give me a job. Nobody is ever going to treat me as anything other than ""the blind guy"". Tired of being discriminated against by even my closest friends and families. Tired of having people always let me down. Tired of living in a world that wants nothing to do with me. Tired of this life."
Should I hang myself or jump?,"My tinnitus has driven me over the edge and now I'm starting to get serious about dying. I want to die in a more painless manor, but am too cowardly to shoot myself. Which method is better? Especially is I want my brain and organs preserved. "
Just want a friend,I have done what I can.  I have lost everything including my children.  No fight left.   I think i got it right.   Praying that it works.
For the first time I am contemplating just ending things,"I've been battling depression since my teens but I had never really taken to the idea of taking my life, I had never reached that point, I had been close. Until now. A recent break up has made me spiral into a state of despair I could never imagine possible. Those feelings of worthlessness I've spent nearly a decade fighting off all came back in one moment. This constant feeling of hopelessness, pain, I can't take it anymore. The one person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with, has deleted me from hers as though I meant nothing. It's ruined me. I try to put on a brave face, remind myself that eventually I will get over this and move on but that doesn't work. Nothing I do helps. A few days ago, it just came to my mind, that I would be better off dead and ever since, it's all I can think about. I even dreamt about successfully killing myself. It brings me comfort knowing I have this option available. "
I'm being ridiculous,"I suffer from anxiety attacks (big whoop probably everyone here does too) but it gets worse when I go to college. Everyday I feel like noone wants me there. Like they could care less whether I go to class or not. This morning my advisor walked past me without saying hello, he didn't even look my way. I feel like the Ted of my life (Scrubs) and that I'm pathetic and worthless. Man do I feel like I'm preaching to the choir. I have goals, but most days I feel like my anxiety overwhelms my goals. I want a better life but right now all I can think about is leaving and never coming back. I feel worthless and needy, like my problems are so big that I need strangers to help me out. I want to go back home and never leave. I don't know what to do anymore. My class starts at 11 and I have classes until 6pm. That's 7 hours of being trapped by people who hate me. Plus b/c of Irma I haven't done most of my homework so I feel like an even bigger waste of space. I know I'm being ridiculous. That just because one person didn't greet doesn't mean I should kill myself. But I want to, so bad I want to just jump off a building. At most it might be an inconvenience to them. I'm just so tired of being me."
"I know I need to seek help, but I can't afford it...","My suicidal ideation has been getting worse for months, and last week my good friend killed himself. I know it's normal to have a lot of guilt, and sorrow to not see him anymore, and I've been trying to allow myself to grieve. At the same time I'm happy for him that he's not suffering anymore. My last suicide attempt was 6 years ago when I was 19. I've been really researching it again, and think I have a plan. I just need to get my affairs in order. Logically I know I need to get help, but I can't afford to. I live several states away from my closest friends and all of my family in an intentional community. The people I live and work with are great, but not anyone I'd go to with this. My psychiatrist is also several states away back home.
I just got this job; I volunteered for the company full time last year and was offered a salaried position and have been working it 2 weeks and can't screw this up. I'm too far in debt to rack up hospital bills, and I couldn't even take the time off to go inpatient; I get 5 vacation days a year and I want to use those to go home for Christmas.
I know what'll end up happening is I'll attempt again, and hopefully succeed. The way I see it, there's no other choice. I'm alone either way. "
Got the last of my things from my ex's house today.,There's no reason for me to hang around anymore. Everything hurts and I just want to sleep it all away.
Needing to die for good,"I cause bad things to happen. My girlfriend was raped...then several weeks later I was raped. I feel like I cause rapes.I think I drove someone to kill themselves from bullying.
I'm the reason my mom is suicidal and impoverished. She tells me regulsrly.I feel like the world would be better without me. I hardly have aspirations. I'm. Not a hard worker.
I've been crushed so many times romantically I got into a fetish based ldr.Idk...I know it's clich̩ to say the world would be better without me. But I'm not benefiting anything by being here. I would do better to just feed worms"
I despise this life,Constantly stressed all day. Im never feeling human anymore. Things like this are my only escape. This is what misery and pointless feels like. I am hopeless
Been living a lie for 4 years and no light at the end of the tunnel.,"My life is so fucked up. Ive been pretending to go to university for the last 4 years. Lying to my family and friends. I feel so lonely and at the end of my ropes. Ive probably got so many issues but i dont know what to do about it because everything leads into my big issue about lying. I wish I wasnt around so i wasn't a burden and a issue to the world. I am too scared to do anything about it though. First time ive vocalized that i have huge problems, usually i lie to myself and distract myself with TV/internet. I need some help please."
Why try,I have posted this someplace else too I hope that doesn't break any rules. I suffer with severe chronic pain. I have something called CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) it is extremely painful all the time. I thought that I had a great support system. Not only would my boyfriend go with me to appointments but his family would take to to procedures if I needed someone there. My mom works really hard. My abusive father abandoned us when my mother was fighting cancer. She had to find a new place to live with my 2 younger sisters. I worked 3 jobs to help pay their bills and still pay my own rent. Now my mom is in remission and she works double shifts. My sisters didn't even care enough about me to sign my birthday card.Now today I am waiting for my boyfriend to show up and he is going to break up with me. Not only do I lose him but I lose the love of my life and I lose all support. I lose the ability to go for my dream of being a PA. I lose my close friend and more importantly I lose what I thought would be a family for me since mine cant be there for me. I take a lot of different medication. I am willing to bet if i take them all at once it will be able to cause some sort of fatal overdose.
today is the day I say goodbye,"So, I just wanted to leave part of my story behind before I kill myself. I experienced a family loss a few years ago and closely after my long term relationship ended. On top of that the stress from the hardest year of college piled up and I had some sort of a breakdown. From that point on I couldn't study anymore and the last years were a constant cycle of avoiding, anxiety attacks, dread, suicidal thoughts and so on.
I started therapy a few months ago, already been for about 14 appointments and although there have been some little improvements, I feel like that it just can't help me enough. The therapist said that what I experienced years ago is some kind of trauma and that we could work on that.
These past months have been literal hell for me, having experienced another loss in my family just 3 weeks ago.
Tomorrow should be the final(and most important exam) for which I have studied basically nothing.
I feel like I can't go on living like this, so I decided that tonight will be where it all ends.
I suppose this is where the story end and another does not begin."
"One life to live, and that�۪s it. Everyone only gets ONE goddamn life. One chance. And if you fail at it? ���Oh well,�۝ says anyone, everyone, anything, and everything.","It�۪s such bullshit���how unforgiving and harsh and cold-hearted the world is.No one cares; they lie when they say they do. I could die right now, and while people might talk about how great of a person I am, you know what happens next? They move on. ���Oh well,�۝ they say. Maybe it�۪s not because they want to, but rather because they have to.I am ready to die. I fucking hate everyone and everything in my life and in existence. Everything is all so ugly and cruel."
Why bother?,It's all some shitty uphill battle I'm never gonna win. I'm better off just ending it.
Trying to keep my head up,"I'm trying to get myself together, it's senior year and I need to pick myself up before I far farther down. I know my problems are mine alone and I don't want to burden my parents.One thing is that's been making it hard is that I'm pretty lonely, I've been trying to make friends here on Reddit. A lot of fails to say the least, I can't help but need someone to talk to. It's easy to feel that it's a one sided conversation and it's hard to keep trying when it feels that way. I've had people try to talk to me before but then they just stop talking or don't reply. Am I wrong to have the want of someone to talk to and be real friends with? Is it too much too expect? The good news is that I'm feeling somewhat better now, but not sure how long that'll last tbh lol"
Are there any painless ways to die?,"I'm 20 and I really just want to end my life, nothing ever goes well enough with me, I screw everything up, people come into my life and just leave, I don't know why but I most definitely am the problem. No one wants to associate themselves with me and when they do it's cause they want something from me, nothing I do is ever good enough for anyone, when I try to talk to people about my suicidal thoughts they make it seem like I'm seeking attention, I just can't deal with any other hurdle life has put in my way, I've given up on life already and I just need a painless way out."
Suicide makes so much sense.,It even makes sense when I'm not depressed.  How do people not get it?
I have a serious undiagnosable illness and I don't know how to keep going,"I have a pretty serious neurological illness that I can't get a diagnosis for and is getting progressively worse. I have no idea if it's treatable. It's basically preventing me from doing anything enjoyable whatsoever - I can't focus on anything because my memory is so shot, I don't have the physical strength to go out or do anything fun, I'm pretty much in constant pretty severe pain and haven't been able to find any medication that helps. Literally all I can do anymore is lie in bed crying in pain between doctor's appointments where I get more tests done where they can't find anything.The few people who are barely still in my life seem to be doing it more out of pity at this point, because I'm definitely more stress than fun for them right now. I can't do anything fun with people and I'm constantly spaced out, exhausted, and depressed. I almost don't want to see anyone because I feel so guilty for getting them down all the time.I've been trying so hard to stay positive, but I'm really losing any hope here. If there's no treatment, I honestly can't think of any logical reason to keep living, even looking at the situation without depression goggles on. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying in bed weak and in pain and mental fog. I keep trying to tell myself ""this will be the appointment that they find something!"" or ""this will be the specialist that helps me!"", but it's just a neverending series of disappointments. How am I supposed to keep going? When should I just give up? I keep having the thought ""I should just jump off of a bridge while my legs still work well enough to"" and I don't know what to tell myself, because ""it's going to get better"" just feels like a lie more and more every day."
Hounded by Google Groups Depression/Suicide Post,"About 15 years ago I posted on Usenet about my depression and suicidal ideation. Actually, I'd emailed somebody and they put it up for me -- except they actually put my full name there and email. I was mortified and just withdrew from the whole thing. I'm not sure, I don't remember too well.The search result pretty much disappeared from Google. I don't know what the mechanics of it were, but however. And I was able to forget about it.About three days ago I discovered, though, that due to Google Groups caching all of Usenet (I don't know when, and I'm no tech expert) a Google search for my name brings up this particular post in the top five or six results.I can't describe how I feel now. I've barely slept in the past few days. Have been trying to get it taken down somehow. Emailing Google. Trying to report it as effectively containing medical records, etc, as this is one of the few things Google takes things down for.Have tried doing a DMCA takedown of it, but no avail.It's almost sort of ironic that in recent years I've largely won in my battle against the Black Dog. But this has somehow plunged me to the point of really wanting to just top myself. Knowing that family and friends will have seen this post -- I don't know how many months it's been there, I don't make a habit of Googling myself. God only knows what impact it's had work-wise -- perhaps that's part of why my freelance work has been shit beyond belief. Not that I should make excuses, but still.It feels like I'm kind of being hounded by it to do it. That, with my ideation and darkest thoughts from before being dragged up like this, I have to somehow make sense of it by killing myself.I can't think straight as I'm completely sleep-deprived. But it feels like I can't sleep until I've solved the issue. And the easiest way, it feels, for me to solve the issue sejumpems to be to just fuck everything and find a busy highway now to walk in front of a car at, as my stated intentions from however many years ago were."
Is it worth it to call/text a hotline?,"I am in need of help but worried that I'd be sent to a hospital or something. What if I can't afford it. I don't see any options to get out of ""this"", other than just ending it all.
(edit: This is a throwaway acc. I posted other more-in-detail things here from my ""main"". Didn't want to seem annoying and just wanted to post a simple question.)"
Created a life I can't leave,"Hi.It took me an embarrassingly long time to work up the courage to post here. I guess I saw it as a sign of failure, a sign of giving up, but I don't now. I just want someone to PM me, just to listen and respond. I've somehow created a situation for myself that I can't see a way out of. I don't want to get into it in this initial post, but I really want to talk to someone.I know this seems like a cry for attention, but really, its a cry for help. I'm aware enough to recognize that.Thanks."
Going on: an exercise in futility,"I've really been contemplating suicide lately.. I just really want to hurt myself... not physically, but emotionally.I don't know why...I'm posting with my main account, because I just don't care anymore.My work sucks and is stressy and if I wasn't such a coward I'd just leave.I've been telling people to stop talking to me, even though I thrive in social situations I skip meals just so I get to feel pissed...I all feel like it's so pointless. If I do it now, nobody will miss me. I haven't made a mark in this world and I never will.
I have 0 potential and I'm not really good at anything.I just don't see the point anymore."
i seek death. thoughts?,"hi all. just want to say i'm entirely new to reddit. literally spent 10+ minutes trying to figure out how to use this web but I just wanna share what's going through my head right now (and maybe seek some opinions?).first of all, i have been contemplating about death along with passive suicidal thoughts for a considerably long amount of time now + depression + anxiety. recently, i realized that i'm just way too tired for all these any more. the daily struggle to fight against these thoughts and survive weights me down so much to the point where i have made the decision to just drop every thing i care about.i was keen on recovering/overcoming/adapting with my mental illness before but as of now, i have entirely stopped my medications. the only pill i really take now is my sleeping pills since sleeping takes so much lesser effort to live. everyday is spent waiting for my brain to get worse and hoping that one day, i would have a reason + motivation to turn my passive suicidal thoughts to active ones. plans have been made, dates have been set, time has been considered. everything is set except for that one final probe.i have slowly cut off most of my relationship with others (family, friends, any humans) ever since depression started and now, i'm cutting off my inner circle of friends too who(m) i have shared my problems with. work wise (which i can't leave due to some reasons), i have began to erase my existence by slowly fading out of everyone's life. i cleared all my stuff from my desk and now it's almost an entirely brand new desk. i longed for one day where i can just disappear and not having any one to remember for because i don't want to affect any one. i don't want any one to have ""oh I had this one friend that committed suicide"" part of their lives. there is nothing that bounds me from this world any more. not friends, not family, not any thing. i cant emphasize how tired i am and there is no words to explain exactly how i am feeling now. i don't consider about my future at all since i actually did plan to end my life off at this ""certain age"" which ultimately, i didn't due to the lack of the final probe i mentioned. it feels like i have been over-living since i have no other plans after that ""certain age"" of mine but thinking about my future triggers my anxiety so much that i'll just drop whatever i am doing and become a small black hole of despair and misery. therapy and professional help wise, i have gone for lots of them but now, i have only one psychologist that is really helping and also the one who(m) i am brutally honest with. he knows everything that i have typed so far and i'm extremely lucky to have someone willing to pull me out of my drowning thoughts. but like i said, i gave up. i gave up holding on to life and i have closed off that option of receiving help from him or any one in fact. i don't feel guilty at all for i'm a selfish being.don't worry (if any one actually cares and if you do, i appreciate it) because my planned dates aren't exactly near yet unless my brain one day decides to push everything forward and ruin my detailed plan.i'm seeking opinion of what the community thinks of my situation. maybe something might probe me away from the suicide path or even further into it. whatever works, i honestly don't care which direction i go any more.i thank any one in advance if i don't reply immediately (i have no idea how to use reddit) for any replies that may appear here and i apologize if this is something you are not interested in."
What should i do?,"I've been imagining ways on ending my life, waiting that something might happen that would end it, with it not being with my own hands ..
I think i just received a sign this morning. I was going through my wallet. And i saw the blade i bought a few weeks ago, i swear it wasn't there before ... bec i've been searching for it.
And now, it's just there. Tempting me...."
How risky is it to talk to therapist about suicidal ideation?,"I just want to know.  It's a new therapist - I've moved - and s/he doesn't know me well.  I don't want them to do anything rash, ie call the authorities. It's a different country and I don't know how things work here.  I don't want to be ""sent off"" for being a threat to myself.  I'm not.  Any insights? Anyone out there say something to the therapist about ideation and get ""shipped off"" or lose their kids or anything like that?  Don't worry, I'm not gonna do it, I just don't know if I can trust this new therapist."
Am I the only one who feels this way,"I've noticed that, well, at least with me, I tend to handle sadness well when I'm already quite despondent. When I'm doing perfectly okay, these sad thoughts attack me, and my mood immediately takes a turn for the worse. It's almost as if by being happy, I'm letting my guard down and am somehow more susceptible to these sad thoughts. So, I find that I have to be sad all the time to not be as sad.I know, the irony is strong with this one.Does anyone else feel this way?"
life has no meaning,"point of life is to have fun and dont think about it
im 12 and i have ennough of it
good bye world"
"I don't want to be happy, I want to be dead.",Simple.
I feel alone,I wish someone care enough about me to check on me no one cares i feel alone i feel like dying i try to be happy i really do but its hard im flunking out of college i just decide to stop attending my classes i been having suicidal thoughts a lot more recently my mom is tired of hearing me i dont want to burden my family my friends have suddenly decided to stop hanging out with me and talking to me but they all hangout with each other and not me i know this because i see it all over social media im wondering why maybe its because im boring or i have nothing special about i know i wont be miss if i go away and die i wake up sad go to sleep sad i dont really want to eat anymore i eat a little everyday i cant tell anyone this because i dont want to seem crazy or be labeled as something im not  i wish i can tell my friends i miss them but i might come off weird or desperate or something no one know this about me. I need someone to talk to i hate feeling this way i do i dont want to feel this way maybe im the problem it has to be something i did to cause this i dont know why my friends dont want to hangout with me anymore
Another post,I literally posted like 2 minutes ago. Probs this won't even let me post this shit for a bat. The only thing that keeps me save is really video games and the music I'm working on. But they are so useless. I'm horrible at then so it's not like I can make a living off of them. I wish I had a talent for anything. I wish I was t such a flawed product. I wish another sperm would have won and I want here. I am just a shut. A piece of filth.  I don't deserve to be here. So many more people who deserve to live so much more then I do but can't. I wish I could make things better for people who struggle. Like the really ooor in Africa and Asia.
"If I wasn't worthless, she wouldn't have left for someone better","I'm a piece of shit. I don't even have a social life anymore. If I died, I'd be lucky if anyone noticed. What's the point of living if you have nothing to live for. Sure, I have myself, but I hate him. It's almost been 6 months, but I think of her every day. She loved me, but then she left when she found a better deal. Guess I can't blame her for not wanting a sack of shit like me."
Does calling a suicide hotline track your call/log it/potentially tell owner of household being called from?,Sometimes. Kind of. It depends from line to line. It is possible to notify the police of the location of the call. Annnnnnyways is that really what you wanted to know? Or would you rather have someone to talk to?
Has anyone told their boss about their suicidal thoughts when it's revolved around work? How did you frame it? How did things go?,Just talked to someone that suggested I address my depression and suicidal tendencies up-front with my boss since it all revolves around work and work-related stress.I instantly thought of about a million ways that could backfire and put me in a worse off position but has anyone else tried this? How did it go?
i just cut ties with all of my friends so it will hurt them less when i kill myself,they are obviously angry and sending me messages about how they must have never mattered to me. honestly i don't care anymore. i want them to hate me so it hurts less when i'm dead. im going to kill myself within the month. i cannot take this pain anymore. i am unworthy of any type of friendship or care. i am unworthy of living in general.
I want to die so bad,"I feel like my life has been a pointless lie. I have no real friends. My family does not really care about me and has lied and been manipulative. I have been in constant conflict with them. I am trapped living at my mom's house unable to find any job to pay enough for me to move. It is so humiliating, I am a 23yr old male and treated like some sort of mental defect by those around me.  I feel exhausted. I used to be so optimistic when I was younger but that optimism has been withered away to nothing after wave after wave of depression getting more and more severe.I have been through 5 relationships in seven plus years that all ended up failing because they all ended up giving up on me and not giving a shit.  I live in a stupid rural town in a dumb backwards state where I feel completely different from everyone else around me. I feel alone and trapped in a shrinking box, constantly tormented by my anger, my despair of being unable to escape this misery. I just want to die, die painlessly and stop this endless cycle of disappointment. I have been raped, lied to, stolen from, and constantly betrayed by supposed friends and now exs. The only thing left in me is pain and sadness."
Where do I start...,"Hey there. I don't know how to do this so I'll just start.I'm 21 years old, diagnosed with depression and bpd, and I just see no meaning in life for a long time now. People would kill to switch positions with me. A well paid job, a car, moving into my own apartment soon, I come over as a very confident person (which I'm not), I'm decent looking and have loads of friends and a pretty good social status.I just feel like nothing makes sense tho. I hate my work. Everyone says I should appreciate it because of the pay and how good the working hours are but I just absolutely hate it. I hate even the thought of not being able to decide for myself when I wake up or where I spend my time at. I went through all my other options and I'm worse off with all of them.I hate how superficial the world around me is. I could afford a fucking Iphone or a nice watch easily, but it doesn't make sense to me. Similar stuff to half the price work just as good or even better. Why do people need to show off. I hate that I think that I'm smarter than the majority of people around me. I know very well I'm not but it just feels like it to me if that makes any sense. I feel like an edgelord when I talk like that but I can't help it.I hate smalltalk. All conversations I have are so bland and boring. Idgaf what my co workers did on their weekends because I know they just got drunk or  they went to the cinema or what not. If you did something cool hey I'm all up for it tell me about it but it's always the same shit I'm hearing.I hate that I read a lot of books on psychology and human behaviour that I know why people act in a certain way and why everyone ""follows the herd""
I want to be like that (again) too. To not worry again.I hate that I can't appreciate what I have. Wealth, a caring family, a shitton of friends. Why can't I appreciate all of those things. I want to. There are millions of people who have it way worse than I do.I hate to put on a mask all the time. To act nice to everyone. I hate 90% of the people that surround me. I can't show how sad I am at work or with my friends. It only ends in pity and I don't need that. I'm worse of with pity than I am with my act of a strong confident man that I put up all the time.I hate not being able to love anyone. An amazing girl likes me and I can't build up any love for her because I don't trust anybody anymore. Through my experience and what I read about how human relationships (romantic or not) work it's just not possible for me to love anyone again just because they are nice. I put up so many standards one must fulfill before I can like them, that it's quiet impossible that I'll ever be in a relationship again. The thing is that I'm not a good catch either so I can't even expect anyone to like me. My real me. There are plenty of people who like my ""mask"".I hate being so sad with no real reason. I hate hating so much. My sleeping pattern is completely fucked. Some days I sleep 12 hours and some I don't sleep at all, like today. It's 5 a.m. here and I haven't slept a minute and I'm heading to work after posting this. If someone read this till down here thanks for hearing me out. I know a lot of this probably makes little sense or contradicts itself but I'm sorry. Like I said I haven't slept at all and I found this subreddit and wanted to get shit of my chest.I have been contemplating suicide a lot the past few years but I won't go through with it because of my family and friends. I made a pact with myself that I'll do it when I'm 30 and things are still as shitty as they are rn. I already know exactly how I will do it and that alone scares me.Thanks again and gave a nice day."
Getting harder to answer the late night question.,"Which is basically just ""Why not?""  I used to have things I was waiting for, even if they were just things like movies I wanted to see.  Can't think of any now.  Running out of answers.  "
Just called the suicide hotline and the lady hung up on me.,"I told her about what was bothering me. She said that people have it worse than me and asked me if I was going to kill myself at that moment. I responded ""not at this very moment"" since I was on a walk. Then she said goodbye and hung up."
Can't find a job fuck my life,"It's not a new thing I know, a lot of people go through this. I'm not special.Graduated from university months ago (psychology because fuck me that was the worst mistake I've made, useless as fuck degree) and also got an English teaching qualification (CELTA) but haven't been able to get a single fucking job. I feel like a useless piece of shit just staying at home applying online, I have no energy to leave the house and going out with friends is too expensive for broke as fuck me.I don't even know what I want to do with my life and I've resorted to ranting to strangers on the internet. I just feel so useless and that there's nothing out there for me. I've had constant suicidal thoughts for the past ten years but never thought to act on them. I still fantasize about jumping in front of traffic, trains, off buildings, though I've never done anything about it. Just can't see the point of life anymore, I'm just a detriment to society.Fuck me, I just hate myself so much."
Just broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. I can't live with these constant reminders.,"i had been neglecting her for the past three months. i sohuld have caught on but i didnt. last week she told me she wanted to breakup and i wanted to change. i tried so hard to change but she kept yelling at me for being too suffocating. one second i'm neglecting her and the next im too much. i couldnt take the yelling and i snapped. i broke up with her and drove her to her dorm in university instead of our apartment. i regret it so much. ive texted her too many times. i cut my arms all the way down to my elbow. i talked to my mom and she's on her way ove rhere but i dont want to continue living. i have plans of killing myself next month if things dont get better. shes my first girlfriend, my first love, my first kiss. we broke up one time before and i obsessed over her. i couldnt stop thinking ofher. god i dont want to do taht again. but it seems apparent she doesnt want to work through our problems so i had to end it. i regret it so much. maybe i could have lived with her yelling at me for a few months and things would have returned to normal. im so fucking stupid. i dont have any friends. my only contact with anyone that cares about me is my family about once a month, my parents are divorced, but they each live about 1hr30min from me. they care about me but i cant convince myself that that's enough. i would destroy them by killing myself but its not enough. i just wanat to die"
I dont know what is wrong with me please help!,"I have problem talking in long conversations, i love being around people but yet i just sit in a silent mode just listening to what people are saying, even when i try to talk i just throw comments about the subject people talking about i dont find anything else to say so i just keep listening and smiling.
My friends loves me though, i cant figure out the reason but it seems like i have a weird personality (they mentioned it before) but a cool one.
It takes me alot of time to start talking( years till i find the right personality thats suit them )  in group of friends ( never was able to talk to individuals specially females ) i can stay talking to a girl weeks by texting but if i saw her in street i act like i didnt see her or just smile and keep walking !
It feels like iam never the real me when iam around people i be what they like the most i think thats explain why iam so loved but i cant have a deep relationship with an individual just active in groups.
It feels like i dont have a specific personality i cant even decide what to eat when i go to a restaurant or something i just order what anyone ordering , when iam alone i just keep eating the samething over and over again.
I feel like iam a million personality and when i think deep i cant really find mine its like i never had one, i cant figure out what i like or hate.
Everybody telling me iam very smart i dont feel like it tho ( i got a very big brain size maybe thats why people think iam smart !) i love fixing computers but the problem is i dont figure  the problem my self i just write on google and apply the solution, i do that in every thing in life that people come to me to fix their stuff and i just do what i mentioned above and i do it, thats another reason people think iam smart.
I suffer from depression nearly whole my life the main reason of my depression is my social abilities.
Just to mention my mother passed away when i was 7 years old my father had anger problems and used to beat me up alot with or without a reason.
Iam also not sure of what i wrote here, i cant really know how i feel or what is going on with me.
I also attempted suicide couple of times with no luck.
I never clean my room until there's no place to walk lol
I dont take care of my body like i eat one time a day and i can stay months without drinking water just soda and red-bull.
I find it so weird to share my feeling with others even my family, and that one time i did i felt something like guilty later when i time to review my day at night, i nearly regret everything i did during the day.
I went to a doctor explained all that he prescribed me a depression and anxiety bills but didn't really work for my social life.
I find it very hard to focus i lose my attention so fast during conversations or studying.
Sometimes when i read stuff i have to read it couple more times in order to understand it.
Sometimes i feel like everybody is talking shit behind my back even when iam sure they dont i still find it make more sense that they do and it really drives me crazy.
Sorry for all that but iam trying to find out whats wrong with me.
And also excuse my english since its not my first language.
Iam 23 years old male by the way.
Thanks for your time ! "

"I know people will miss me, but I don't care","Wtf do they know? I'm only a 15 year old guy with anxiety and depression. They'll never understand. My life has gone to shit, their lives are great. Fuck this. I should just end it"
I won't make it to 21,"People would kill to get the advantages I have had in my life, from a fairly wealthy and supportive family to being born in one of the most prosperous areas in the world.  However, I can hardly get myself to attend my college classes, and it is my first year.  I would have blown my brains out already if it wasn't for my parents supporting me, it would destroy them to have their son die.  I just know I won't amount to anything in my life, I think I am just too lazy or maybe something is wrong in my head.  I have tried to get better but it didn't work in high school and it isn't working now.  The only place I see myself in 2-3 years is either as a bum leeching off of my parents or dead, and I am not sure what to do.  I'm not sure what I expect from this post, but I guess it just helps to see my thoughts typed out and if anyone else feels the same way."
What's some good advice for dealing with temporary low periods?,"I'm in a really low place right now, but I'm pretty sure it'll be gone within a few days. This has happened before. But it just comes up out of nowhere, like I was totally fine, loving life, thinking of sending out a company-wide email (I work for a small business, ~30 employees) to everyone just saying I love them and I feel so blessed to be able to spend time with them. Then suddenly for no reason at all it's like this overwhelming feeling of emptiness and wanting to kill myself, like completely out of nowhere. It's just like this pit in my stomach and feeling of desperation. It'll be gone by the end of the week, probably, but is there advice for dealing with this kind of thing?"
Apparently I have no family.,"I've been gone for some time from Reddit, geez.
I've been having a rough time. Latley I've went back into school and I'm getting bullied again. I tell the staff and my parents, however it doesn't fix the problem. I just keep getting physically and mentally and verbally and cyber bullied. I found my parents don't really want me anymore and that my boyfriend to them is just another guy I'll run away with... they threatened me into going into the hospital and then I hated it up there. And they've almost put me into foster care... I have no goals and I'm doing horrible in school. I've gained 25 pounds so all my cloths on me are tight so I'm always uncomfortable and they won't buy me new ones.... I have a buckle collar that I wear all the time. Im considering on choking myself to death tonight on my door knob, after I take a bunch of pills. Last words... well I have a loving boyfriend who is ready to stay his life with me and as I am with him but I don't have enough patience with my parents that I fight with everyday... I can provide more info but for now this should sum stuff up. "
I'm giving it one week.,"As the title suggests, I'm giving myself one more week with the hope that things will somehow get better. I have gotten to a point where it doesn't seem possible to ever be happy again. I have no friends, no prospects and no real reasons to live anymore. I can no longer stand the constant brain fog and anxiety that comes with these feelings either. I feel braindead most of the time, which makes it hard to do anything at all to try and better myself. Even as I write this, I am struggling to think of the next thing to say. I have recently started going to therapy, but it seems like it's more stressful than it's worth. My therapist talks a lot, and it's hard to get a word in sometimes. I also just found out that it's going to cost more than I had initially figured, and I probably won't be able to afford it anyway. Don't try to tell me that things will get better, because I'm sure they won't. Anytime it's seems like things are finally starting to look up, these horrible feelings return and I find myself stuck in the bottomless pit of depression yet again. I close myself off from the world and shut people out in my life who mean well. I lose my motivation and end up no better off than when I started trying to improve. I'm hopeless and fucking tired of it. The very fact that I am this way is also the reason I am so alone in life. Nobody wants to be around someone like me. Nothing positive can come from my existence and I think it's time to end it once and for all."
"I'm 12 a twelve year old boy, I just want to wrap a cord around my neck and die. Please help me.","Hey, I'm just a 12 year old kid and I feel super suicidal. I just want to get out of the godforbidden shit-shack called school.
I have a best friend, but every time I try to hang out with him, he sees his other best friend and I instantly become a third wheel. He says that we likes us both the same but it is just so obvious that he likes him more than me.
I keep telling my parents that I want to be homeschooled and they say, ""it's not what is best for you.""
I was searching ways to kill myself quickly and painlessly on the internet and my mom saw my history and she told me dad. That was the night I was going to end it all. My dad called on his way to work and called my mom. (They are divorced which is one of the reasons I'm so depressed, but at least thy are still friends). My dad started texting me and my mom talked to me about it. The way they were so upset and crying and begging me to not take actions is one of the reasons I'm holding back with every fiber in my body.
My sister was all of a sudden so much nicer to me, so Im pretty sure my parents told her.
I have an appointment in about a week but I don't know if I will live to see it. :(
My dogs are so happy and sweet. I love my dogs, sister, and parents the same. I love baseball and I'm very talented at it, which is one of the reasons I don't pull the trigger everyday.
I spend a lot of time with my dad and we are basically best friends. I would love to spend more time with my mom, but she is depressed too and she gets upset and angry very often. I am always worried my parents will be disappointed or my sister will make fun of me if I bring home a C or lower.
I almost killed my self with a cord earlier today and I had it tight around my neck for  about 3 seconds when somewhere deep down inside told myself to stop what I'm doing and calm down.
I hate school so much and my parents always think I'm being bullied, but the truth is, I'm not. I'm just like every other kid who hates schools, but just to a way higher degree of hatred and despise toward the damned place. I don't even cuss a lot but this subject just pisses me off so much. I'm loved by many people who I know would be upset.
The thing is, I always want to commit sluiced but every chance I get, I don't even though I could spare myself of the years of torture to come with just 10-30 seconds.
I'm never happy anymore and even when doing things I love I'm not happy and I just want to not be depressed and not hate school with so much anger and despair.
I also have Tourette Syndrome which I don't think helps the situation.
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME! I CANT TAKE IT AND I NEED ADVICE! _���_��� "
Sometimes I honestly feel like I'm at my end.,"I don't think things are going to get better, I think they're going to get worse, and I have no control over any of it at all. I think one of the few things I had in my life that made me feel like I had a grip on anything was her, and she's gone now, due to my own faults and mistakes. I don't blame her. I think she was kind enough to waste her time on me, but like everything else good that enters my life, it had to go.And so here I am. I'll sit here and imagine that it's all alright, but I feel like I'm just lying to myself in order to try to make myself believe it, and all I want to do is go back to even just a month ago, when I thought I knew what pain was, but I had no fucking idea that I could hurt this badly.I see so many positive things happen in people's lives, like them being able to afford a house, end up with a person that loves them, etc, and I catch myself telling myself ""..but that's not for you."" in some weird way to brace myself. I feel like I make jokes about killing myself a lot because it helps desensitize myself to the actual act. Maybe I'm hoping that the rest of my friends will cut me out soon, and I can just.. I don't know.I'm not planning on anything, I just wanted to tell someone."
"On the outside, my life seems perfectly fine. But I hate the way my brain works. I hate having depression/anxiety/OCD/BDD and it's ruining my life. Fuck this life","I really don't know how to say it, but I've been battling a war with my mind for far too long. I have severe anxiety, OCD issues and I used to self medicate by using opiates (IV heroin specifically) to numb the pain and clutter in my mind. I am sober and in recovery now, but I really can't take this shit. I really hate the way my brain works, and wish I didn't have this persona. I reflect back on my past friendships which are no longer there because I become distant and isolated from people. I hate how I can't form lasting friendships with people like I used to in high school. My life is a lonely, sad joke right now and I feel like I am dying on the inside. I try and better myself but I don't really see any improvement in the quality of my life. I wish I wasn't like the way I am. I am a disgrace."
Parent's ideas nearly ending up hurting me more one way or the other,"Laughing at the fact that nearly all of my parent's ideas ended up in me hurting one way or the otherI kept being called crazy by my parents and told me i am not adventurous enough and paranoid because i overthink alot. And when their ideas goes bad, i still kept getting the blame.I kept being insulted by them alot and be humiliated in public, be called names. Had an extremely basic argument on ""you can't avoid problems in life because problems are a part of life""I mean you can avoid it by being prepared or not being stupid which they are doing to me particularly. It even got to the point that the arguments bordered already to religion, in which i already got scared of Because was told ""honor your father and mother, because they, no matter what will standby you and if it weren't for us you wouldn't be here in the first place"" i mean that is prettt stupid on a whole new levelThen when people asked them ""why did he change ? , he was not like that before"" I still kept getting blamed at. Edit: in the eventuality that i end up dead, in jail or both considering its my parents here that i am talking about ? Please a visit or talks from a stranger who has been through so much won't hurt."
"Unemployed 23M, I can't stop fantasizing about an attempt.","I have been battling serious depression for 3 years. I have been getting help for over 1. On fluoxetine as well as cannabis. I self harm, currently 2 months clean.I'm sitting in my apartment that my parents pay for with my long time friend getting stoned and watching tv. All I can think about is cutting myself, or killing myself. I even saw my counsellor today, that my parents pay for, sigh I will never be abke to function. I frequently fantasize about attempting, I don't want to die. I just desperately want more immediate help. I just want to stop suffering. In Ontario, Canada our mental health support is terrible.I've failed and had to drop out of University, all at once I lost free counselling, prescription coverage and my transit pass.I'm currently trying to fill out job applications and get my resume out. How am I supposed to work?I've been hospitalized before and it was fucking horrible. 8 hour wait time in emergency, then a 72 hour hold. I'll go into cannabis withdrawals and they'll shove me full of fucking benzos.My counsellor wants me to toss the blades and eat, obviously, but neither have happened yet.My friends and family our supportive, yet I'm still useless. I'm so tired, I just don't want to live anymore. It doesn't seem worth it to me or ever. I'm only alive to stop others from suffering."
When will it end?,"Since 14 (almost 26 now) I've wanted to kill my self for so many times I've stopped counting. It's always the same, I feel there is something wrong, I have a strong anxiety attack and then I start to think of committing a suicide. I start to look for the best way how to do it, then my calming pills start work, I cry myself to sleep and the next day I want to visit a doctor and tell her I need help. Sometimes I do that, sometimes I don't. She sends me to see a psychiatrist and then to another psychiatrist and they all will prescribe some pills that help me to sleep but never to solve any of my obsessive thoughts of committing suicide. Then I live normally again for few days, weeks, if I'm lucky even months...and then it's
back. It will always come back. Right now the frequency of these attacks is increasing. Few months ago I moved and now I live alone which I don't really handle well, I try to overcome my breakup that has happened almost 8 months ago after 3 years together while I still love him, I have a new job which is stressful on it's own (high school teacher here) and I haven't still finished my uni programme and the time flies so fast without me doing anything productive. So now I'm sitting here, writing this stuff so that I don't browse the suicide advices websites and I'm asking myself what the hell is wrong with me? I'm young, very attractive, intelligent, kind person who has the whole future ahead of her, but I'm just unable to appreciate it, because there is something very wrong inside of my head. People around me would never expect it as I come off as a confident, popular extrovert and it makes it even more difficult to actually speak about this with anyone in my life. My parents know about it, but we are not in much of contact and my friends have their own lives and problems. This is a vicious circle. If it ever ends, it will be not a happy-end. Another worthless person who wishes nothing else than go to sleep and never wake-up. One day it is going to happen. Hopefully it will be done by the hand of fate/god/whatever and not by my hand. The odds right now are on the latter though. "
I'm defective.,"I'm staring down my preferred method right now. Can't even begin to describe the amount of shit on my back.Three suicide attempts later, here I am, about to make a fourth one. And I'm using a throwaway to post because I'm scared of potentially surviving this one.Back in December I had a terrible injury from falling on my own body with my full then weight of 97 kg, a follow up to three nasty concussions from falling down stairs and getting kicked in the head. A shot nervous system. Chronic pain. A fucked spine. Limb weakness, tingling, total loss of function in arms and legs. I can't go anywhere alone in fear that I'll lose control of my legs in the middle of a crosswalk or something. Massive fucking medical bills, and I'm dirt poor.I'm a minor, and I have a very illegal job I'm holding down at a small accounting company to help my parents pay my dorm and medical bills and regular life expenses. I recently had my glasses stolen, so that's another large sum of money and visual impairment to deal with until I save up for a new pair. 11yrs of terrifying skin picking issues. Left me looking like a meth addict, as mothers of small children in public places often like to tell me. I can't eat anymore. I haven't been able to sleep properly since I was an infant, but now I'm breaking down from exhaustion. I feel like more of a liability to everyone than a friend, or a family member, or a girlfriend, or a daughter. I can't tell my mom everything. I can't tell my friends. I can't tell my girlfriend. If any of the secrets I keep get leaked into the public, I'm going to be facing certain homelessness, discrimination from teachers like the other kids like me in my high school, I'll get fired. I'm already dragging a massive blanket of trauma from 'back then' , I don't want to do this any more. I'm done. If my body isn't planning on killing me somehow, I'll do it by my own fucking self.I can't even reach out to a therapist. Tried three of them, two didn't take me seriously when I started off by mentioning my skin as a legit issue I have mentally, and one just told me I'm a typical whiny child who should just grow up and learn how to live with and not make a big deal out of being disabled in any way.I've been actively suicidal for years now. I'm sick of lying that I'm okay to everyone I know to ensure at least a modicum of a normal life,  of being abused by peers, by my own body, by my brain, by myself.I'm fucking done with it. Hell, maybe I'll take myself off of everyone's fucking back. At least my parents won't have to spend so much money on a defective, useless child who doesn't make the good grades she used to make and who can't even be healthy and happy like literally all the others. Cheers, everyone. I'm done."
My world has come crashing down and I can't see any other escape,"I also posted this in  and so I'm sorry for double posting but I feel like this thread was actually more suitable. Here's my story...I've just been dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years for another girl with who he's been friends with since before we met. He slept with her before we met and apparently has been talking to her without me knowing all throughout our relationship. He hasn't 'physically cheated' per se (that I know of) but I feel he's been 'emotionally cheating' on me for a while. It hurts so f%$king much that it's actually like physical pain at the moment and I can't stop crying. He's also refusing to talk to me. We all live in the same place and I'm just heartbroken and horrified by the idea that I have to see them together in the future and bump into them.
I've also found out that my dad also had an affair with someone when I was 18 years old (I'm now 26) and when I had anorexia (I was close to dying from my anorexia) and cheated on my mum . They've been married for 35 years and my dad has always been my rock who I've always looked up to. Their relationship was one I idolised and always wanted. I can't get my head around the idea he cheated on my mum. My sister died when she was 8 and I was 4 and they managed to get through that. My mum deserves so much better and I'm so angry that he could ever do that to her at such a vulnerable time in their lives.
This year I've also lost my best friends after an incident happened at a Hen Party which made me re-evaluate if they were actually 'friends'. They were acting bitchy and awful and so I ended up telling the bride that I don't think I could be her bridesmaid anymore and she ended the friendship and all the other friends sided with her.
I've lost my friends, my partner, and my Dad in such a short space of time. I feel like I have nothing but my job but even though I love my job it's not enough to keep me going. I feel like no one wants me in their lives. I can't stop crying and I just want to die. I don't see what the point to anything is anymore. My mum is my only friend I have."
double suicide,"i dont know what im supposed to say, in all honestly, other than just me and my friend are planning a double suicide within the next month."
I can't keep going like this,"I've had suicidal ideation for almost 20 years now. I've never gone through with it though. I just keep going along, not changing anything, surviving for another day. I am excellent at talking a good game, making plans, etc but I have no follow through. On the one hand, that means I am still alive, but in the other hand that means nothing gets better and really, things just get worse. I am amazingly disconnected and detached from life. I just don't care about anything.  I haven't been doing my job, it has finally caught up to me and will likely be fired this week. I don't exercise, I don't sleep right, I don't eat right. I barely manage to keep myself distracted for enough for it to be time to go to bed again. I avoid everything I can. I just want to die. I just want it to stop. Nothingness would be a gift. But I can't do it. I can't follow through. Please God just kill me"
I want the sadness to end,"Hello, So, I'm a 17 year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately.For the past 2 years, I've felt depressed almost all of the time. I can't pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way. While I've never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything, both of my parents have, so I believe it's not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something.Some stretches of time have felt harder than others. This past week is one of those times. I've had trouble getting to sleep, I've woken up late or early every day, I've had trouble focusing, I don't feel engaged in anything I do, I can't get myself to do any school work, and I've cried for at least half an hour every day.The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts. I've unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways. The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating. I don't think I have the nerve to act on them, but I worry sometimes.I've been taking medication (generic Lexapro) every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week. Both of these have a positive impact for sure, but I don't know that they're enough. I still feel hopeless sometimes, like my life isn't worth living. I feel miserable.The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself. I feel like those who would notice wouldn't care all that much. My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house. My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously. One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best. The other is a real sweet heart, but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me. That got to me. All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year. The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about 9 months, and won't return home for about 9 more. I don't know if I can last that long. I miss her so much.I honestly feel like I want to die right now. I want the sadness to stop. I can't handle it. I feel worthless right now.Sorry if it seems like I'm just seeking attention, but I'm hoping getting this off my chest will help. Any advice, support, comments, etc. are appreciated a lot."
"Another sunday, another day spent lonely in agony","Spent pretty much the entire weekend on my own, alone, like I always do. While I had some stuff to do for friday evening and saturday, today was just painful. Sitting there, alone, imagining ways that could give me an excuse to finally off myself. I don't want this miserable life, and this miserable life doesn't want me. Why do I have to keep pushing on? Please, just make it stop :(And this is just one weekend. I'm not excited that I'll have to work tomorrow, but at least I'll be around people (that barely say a single word all day, but still, people). I can't imagine how I'll get through my vacation.let me die :("
Moving the schedule up.,"Making this post for posterity and closure and all that shit, not looking for help. I've fucked myself academically already, meaning my criteria for killing myself happened before the date I set.Meaning there's no reason to stick around until December.I'm going to go buy rope that can withstand enough force to crush my cervical spine and then I am going to go hang myself in the park.I do not particularly care who finds me at this point.Signing off. "
Alcohol and a bullet... What a combo,"I've suffered under depression for as long as I can remember. I'm 29 now, but this bullshit started before middle School. My mother and father divorced shortly after I joined the server that it's Earth. My mom cheated on my dad with a worthless price of garbage, and my dad walled up like China, I was raised into this situation where, no matter what I did, someone important to me said it was wrong and that I should do better."
Im scared,"Im only 12 years old and i genuinely want to die. I feel so alone and its like everyone is oblivious to what is happening to me because im so young so no one ever thinks that maybe something is wrong. Ive opened up to my sister before telling her im depressed and i need help, and she says ""Youre growing up its hormones you'll be fine"". My sister started letting me smoke weed this summer and its the only escape i have, its like i dont have to deal with any sadness or depression and i can be me again and its the greatest feeling ever. But then as im coming down i feel the sadness creep over me and i just start to cry. i want the feeling to last forever. my sister doesnt just let me smoke so i have to suck up to her and do whatever she wants, let her talk to me how she wants, and not be the smallest bit of mean or make any comments or she says ""You cant smoke youre a fucking bitch, go inside"". My brother is the same way, they both almost torment me calling me autistic and an idiot and that im a dumbass and i should never have kids because they would grow up to be retards, she hits me just for fun basically and throws stuff at me and gives me food that she put something gross in and she laughs at me and it hurts it really hurts. she also haves friends over all the time and they have small parties and stuff and when there are drunk people and they wanna fuck each other she tells them to go in my room and fuck, her friends also have punched me before or hit me and when i tell my sister she laughs. she doesnt love me anymore and it hurts it hurts so much. I do this all just so i can smoke because its the only thing that lets me be happy for a little bit. I know im probably destroying my lungs and burning brain cells but i think i would already be dead if i didnt smoke weed the pain is too much and it hurts to have to hold back tears in front of my sister and my brother and there friends but if i cry ill make it worse. and on top of that i have to deal with the constant fear of my mom finding out whats happening. i just want to be a kid again. i want to not always be scared and sad. I want to have people again i can go to and tell them when im sad or just someone to hug me when im crying. childhood shouldnt be this hard but it is, i cry almost everyday because of the torment. I have no self confidence and i always fake sick when i can on school days so i dont have to  get made fun of for having no friends. kids used to be nice, they never made fun of people had no friends but everyone in my school are just dicks now including my old friends. I dont know why everything changed so fast and i know im growing up and things will be different but this is all just to much i cant handle it. and i cant help but think ""How much worse will it get the older i am"". if this is how the real world is i cant do this. im too scared and i dont want to live on in a world of hate and pain. i dont want to be scared on the days i do go to school and i have to come home to my sister. i dont want to live on. everything is too bad. and i cant do this anymore, the pain is excruciating and not even smoking weed helps anymore. my sad thoughts find a way though. and ive come to a conclusion there is no other escape other then suicide.

"I have decided that I am going to kill myself tomorrow, Monday, the 18th.","It's 11:55 PM, Sunday, and I have decided I am going to kill myself tomorrow.
I'm 17, I am a senior, and I may change my mind. So far I don't think I will, but maybe tomorrow will be the best day of my life.
Maybe tomorrow things will change. Maybe I will meet a new person.
Maybe I will get help. Either way, I wanted someone to know this & not call the cops on me. If anything, maybe something someone says here will keep me alive one more say. "
Almost gone,"Friday  I couldn't see or feel any reason n to continue. I couldn't stop crying and was hiding from my kids. At one point I was looking for a bottle of pills sobbing and my younger saw me. She started crying hugged me and said she did not want me to be sick. I felt nothing. I said what I know I'm supposed to say - mommy will be fine. I'm just a little sick but tomorrow it will all be fine. - my other daughter arrived and so did my husband. They all cried and I felt even worse for what I was doing. We all slept together.
I hate myself for not being able to cope and pretend it's all fine. I hate that I'm ruining their childhood and my husbands life. I really want better for them "
the resources suck,"Every single resource, even if they say they have online chat or cal you, requires you to pick up a phone.I'm never going to do that. I don't do that to even do anything in my life.I want help, but I'm so ashamed to get it, for real, in my ""real life."" I know I shouldn't be sitting on the toilet in the middle of the night thinking how much better off my spouse would be without me, but it happens. And it's night. I Can't call. I won't call. I'll just try to keep it together, pretend that I make progress on my goals for my master's every day. In reality I am so miserable and unhappy. I don't have much energy left. He deserves so much more than me. There doesn't seem to be that much argument..."
I have to learn swedish and i am suicidal,Wtf swedish is so gay i will now kill myself if you cant make me know everything of swedish immediately
I really need someone I care about to tell me how much I matter to them right now.,Well I care.
why the f havent i killed myself yet,"hey- i heard of this community and i thought id try to talk here to see if anyone could help me? anyways
i have dependent personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, ptsd and depression with psychotic symptoms. life is literally hell? the only motive im still alive is my girlfriend whom i love very much, but we are in a ldr and im getting the feeling she is getting tired of me. i understand why, i mean, i have literally no qualities to myself and im very high maintenance for the reasons i mentioned above so yeah it does make sense that someone as good as her would notice that she deserves better than me? but still, i want to fucking die because i literally cant survive on my own and shes the only person i trust and if she leaves, ill have nothing left to live for (other than my cat i guess but thats a little dumb a reason to live for) and yeah im just here waiting for her to finally break up with me which shes obviously going to do soon and when she does it ill kill myself. idk if i can get talked out of it but i guess i just had to vent? thank you for reading this shit"
"Colleague/Friend of mine is leaving hints, not sure how to take it from there","So a girl I work with has rapidly become a great friend, even a bit more. She's been leaving kind of heavy hints that she has suicidal thoughts and even a plan ; she told me she had another 4 months, that she can't wait for it to end, that she understands she's something for her friends and entourage but that she's had enough.I'm not exactly sure what I should do in that regards, should I contact the suicide hotline in my region? Should I tell her? I feel like I'd betray her but all I want is her safety above all. Should I listen more and confirm before? We'll talk later tonight, I've read the 2 posts in the sidebar.I'm pretty sure I'll be able to relate with her and use some of the tips that were in the ""Concerned but don't know what to say"" post, I was in a pretty dark place in the last few months, I just don't know how to proceed next. Anyone got any ideas or suggestions?"
[Title],"I suppose I should say something here. Just in case I don't end up doing it later when it's more crucial. It's probably just the hormones and brain chemicals fucking it all up again, so I'm trying not to come off as just some bitchy SWM. I don't really have a lot to complain about. It's not like I'm in an abusive situation (anymore) and I'm pretty much a productive member of society.I have no money problems at present.I guess I just have no friends, or any idea on how to make them.It doesn't really matter. I'm the one causing my own problems anyway. Maybe I'm depressed, anxious, crazy, who knows anymore. I can't figure it out. I don't want to waste people's time crying for help if there's no point to helping me. I should be able to deal with my own problems. I guess that's all I say right now."
I need to vent this out.. And maybe you're able to help me..,"Hi.. I want to commit suicide. But not really. I just got bored of life. Existence is pain.
Let's unload the cards.I'm an 18yo old male, gay (not out), only child in a disintegrating family.
Pretty depressed, anxious, introverted, nihilistic, melancholic.
Having mental breakdowns usually couple times per week
and thinking about suicide almost every day.
Going to sleep with a wish of not waking up.Still student. In a school i hate and i can't see myself having a 9-5 job.
I hate routines and I'm anti-social most of the time.
Haven't been in a relationship yet. Don't wanna be, thanks to self-hatred.
I see myself too much as a complex and unlovable person.
And i don't wanna hurt anybody.My family now basically consist only of my mother and grandma.
My mother have a really low self-confidence and self-esteem
and is under medication because she have some kind of mental illness.
My grandma is .. just normal stereotypical grandma.
Conservative and living alone.I have two close friends. One of them is my classmate. He mentally bullied me
over some period of time in elementary school but we became friends later.
I still don't know how i was able to forgive him when he was ordinarily making me cry.
But i did and he changed. I think he would take a bullet for me and i would do the same.
I would do the same for anybody, because i love other people.
I see others worth, but not myself.
For example, i just recently registered myself as a bone marrow donor to feel more ""useful"".I care about myself to a certain extent. I don't do drugs, i don't smoke, i don't drink
and I'm not promiscuous, like my peers.
I even started to do sports, to get rid of depression, at least for a while,
but it didn't last forever
I don't wanna have a long life. I'm not interested in having a job to make money and
being materialistic (i would like to, but i don't see purpose in it).
Or having a relationship or other deeper bond,
because i don't see purpose in it. Nothing is forever.
Maybe it will change when something happens. And it will not because i will still be who i am.
Bullshit. I'm having a little inner conflict. I see myself as a shitty person. That's why.
My friend recently asked me, just out of curiosity, if there's someone in a world I really
hate. Only person that came up in my head was myself, but i said nobody.I guess I'm not able to off myself normally. I thought about drinking to death
(since i don't drink at all, it would be interesting experience)
but that's not happening.
Because there are still people out there, that would be devastated by my death.
My mother, grandma and friends.
So i can only wish. And i still didn't let depression to take a full control over me.
But it's making it's own way up since i started thinking about more ways to overcome my
self-preservation instinct and emotional barriers. I just somehow accepted that
i will kill myself eventually in a future. I'm also often thinking about doing something heroic,
like saving someone's life somehow. Sacrifice myself.
So I'm stuck in this vicious circle. Thinking about doing something stupid and on the other side
knowing what should i do and what i shouldn't do. Something is still working right in my head i guess.I thought about other non self-destructive methods of getting my sh#t together.
Like talking to therapist or someone. But I'm not much talkative in person
and i wouldn't describe my problem as exactly as i did now, when I'm writing it.
I'm nerd, let's be honest.
And i would not take any medications. I have standards. That's related to my aversion
against alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and similar. I want to keep my body clean.
Another way i thought about is to get into some kind of relationship drama.
Having someone closer. Maybe i would get some confidence and experience.. I'm lonely.
Whatever. Nevermind, that's not happening, who would like a person that hates himself.
And I'm even pushing away my current friends
because i don't want them to see me as I am now. I would be rude and detached.
I also tried to channel my bad thoughts and depression (if i can call it depression)
and use it in some kind of a creative way. Like sports, or writing texts, lyrics and stuff
but i will quickly lose motivation because i don't see purpose in it.
Another thing that crossed my mind was
""F*ck it. You will not have a normal life. But you can
focus on what you like to do and learn.
You can be good at something and that will give you strength .. and purpose""
I always wanted to learn and understand things. But I'm too cynical and realist.
So.. cards are out and i don't know what to do next. I guess i will go watch another episode
of rick and morty and then go to sleep, wishing not to wake up next morning. I wish i was in peace with myself.
What would you guys do? I'm mentally tired.. And it's getting scarier since i started to plan stuff...This text was two times longer but i shortened it so it's readable.
And I'm really sorry for mistakes. English is not my native language."
"I need to tell my story to someone, and I need advice.","I appreciate you all taking the time out of your lives to listen to me complain about mine.I'm 14, and I have what most people would consider to be a blessed life. I live in a large, 2 story house with my parents and my dog, and I have everything I could ever want. Somehow, I still wish I was dead. I have ADHD, and in the first for years of my school life, I had not yet been diagnosed with it yet. Everyone thought I was literally autistic, but I didn't have the label of autism. I had no friends, only people who sighed when I walked in the door. ""I wish he hadn't shown up today"" or ""Crap, he's back!"". In 5th grade, I was, for lack of a better word, diagnosed with ADHD, and given medication for it. Unfortunately, those years have left extremely needy with attention, and so clingy to friends that I actually begin to worry. For example, lets say I'm having a text conversation with one of them, and they want to call me to talk about something. If I don't receive the call request from them within the 10 seconds, I being to question whether they actually want me as their friend, and if maybe they don't trust me enough. I care about people's opinions so much, that I actually consider going through a lot of extra effort to please them. A small example, before posting this I considered making a burn account so that you guys wouldn't look at my username and think I was some overdramatic 12 year old. Moving on, I have a terrible short term memory when it comes to things which is the root of my problems. Often times my parents give me chores to do, and within 10 minutes I've forgotten. The only thing I can remember anything about is my video games, which are slowly consuming my life. They're all I care about, and similar to drugs, I count my life in terms of time until my next playing session. My parents then proceed to yell at, I yell back, I get yelled at for yelling back, and then they simply delete every game I own. As I stated earlier, I'm beginning to live for video games, and when they get taken away, I have no reason to live. This puts me into a state of being passively suicidal. I'm physically and emotionally tired of this constant struggle. I just want it all to end, but I don't have the guts. I've considered cutting, then decided it was probably too painful. I don't have anything to overdose on, I don't have firearms, and the nearest cliff is 13ish miles away. I can't travel that far alone without my parents realizing I'm missing. What do I do?"
"Contacting suicidical friend's family, but it could worsen the situation","One of my closest friend is feeling suicidical. It's not the first time, he'd been in such place before (last one about 3 years ago). Then I've been trying to help as much as I could, contacted our mutual friend for advice what to do (my friend doesn't know about that I did this). Somehow through all our effort he calmed down and got up on his feet again. Lately he is feeling again the same and I believe it got more serious: he already thinks about what he won't see anymore and I suspect he has a plan, that it would look an accident, not a suicide.I had then and I have now this urge to contact his family about it. I don't really know them well except my friend's cousin. My friend blames his parents for being inconsiderate of him and made his life miserable, that they aren't supporting or understanding. But here I face dilemma: if I tell his cousin, who would probably tell his parents, I might lose my friend's trust. Right now he trusts me, since he is telling about suicide to me, I can talk about it with him and telling to his family might drive him away and make the situation worse. On the other hand, I fear that my help might be not enough and to save him I need more help from more people, who know him. So my question is: should I contact my friend's familly and tell them about situation, even if it might result in him hating me for breaking a trust and never ever tell me about suicidical thoughts?p.s. I read guidelines about talking to people at risk.
p.p.s. sorry for my English, there are more important things than it right now."
i want to die,"all of my friends are fake and nobody cares about me, i've lost the only thing that makes me happy(drugs) and i feel more worthless than ever, i just want to cut down my arms and lie in my bathtub and die"
Fucked up foster kid,"Didn't really know what to title this or where to start. I guess I'll start about my past so you can understand why i'm so fucked up now.  I don't know my birth father, my ""step father"" (not married) and mother were drug addicts used to beat and neglect me.  I stayed with them until I was 12 and played into foster care with my step father in jail and my mother in rehab. I'm currently a 16 year old female living with a foster family, my mom's parental rights have been terminated and I am now (essentially) property of the state.  This whole issue has lead to chronic depression throughout my life.  Now a days I just want to die and wish I wasn't born. I spend most of my time on the computer wasting what would probably be the best years of my life; I play a pretty small mmo (like 100 active people) that people like me on, made some ""friends"" and had some ""relationships"" on it but nothing seems to be enough for me.  In real life i am made fun of for being poor (foster parents optimize profits by buying clothes from good will and having the maximum amount of children in the house (which is 8 in my state).) again there's no one I would really call a friend, some people are nice to me and that's about it.  It just feels like nothing is enough, that i'm always lonely and feel unloved, unwanted, and just tolerated.  I can never keep friends or friends group.  Something happens, usually small that hurts my feelings, like not getting invited to do something or not being told information.  I get mad or upset and this stuff happens fairly often, I think this damages my connections to people online which brings up a question I can never get people to answer,  if I am offended or hurt from something small and they don't see what it is (experience from years of friends groups) is it their fault or my fault? Like I am fucked up mentally so should I feel bad for feeling this way? like I'm broken someway that I feel different from most people. I have abandonment and trust issues I NEED to clingy to someone to survive which lead me to ""date"" people online, usually older people (oldest was a 25 yo when I was 15.)  I don't know what to do for this, I have ""friends"" but if I ask them about this stuff it seems like its just an attempt for attentions; like they would think ""wow, you want to kill yourself because we didn't invite you?"" and you can say they aint your real friends if they think that but its me thinking this. I don't want to live, I can't stop feeling this way, I cant stop clinging to a random person that ends up being a dick and hurting me, I can't stop losing friends.  I went to the woods earlier to look for trees to hang myself from.  Guess you guys (and me writing this as a therapy tool) are the only people that can try to help.Edit: issues probably are from trying to find someone to love me like a parent should"
I'm worried about my friend.,"He's not been doing well and has seriously thought about killing himself in the past, and more recently he's losing what seems like a lot of weight. I don't know how to be supportive very well, I don't know what to say to if he brings it up, I just feel like whatever I say will make things worse.How do help someone going through these issues?"
What now?,"Okay guys, I'm new here to reddit and I'm coming here because I found this area of the site, and right now this is the (advice? Help? Conversation?) I need. Long story short been battling depression for years now, which I'm sure some of you know is a living hell in itself. I've been down to the point of having the classic place and time and method to end it all but brought myself to not go through with it. Last night it got to me really badly, I almost ended up doing it. I went online and went to the suicide hotline's online chat, well I was 18th in line so I turned on some music, and between the 2 hour wait and pandora changing the music from gloomy to more upbeat it helped out. When I get to thinking like that its kinda like two parts of my brain, or two me's are thinking different things.One side is saying do it, one side is telling me not to and being rational. Its hard to describe because its so odd to me that my mind is kinda like having 2 different thought processes at the same time but both are so clear and defined. Today isn't much better so far, and its just getting too tiring to combat anymore. I've debated about going to the E.R last night and if it gets that bad tonight again I might but honestly, I'm scared of whats going to happen... I got a job, I got bills, I got debts I'm trying to pay off I don't need to be thrown deeper into it.
I just need an outside voice right now, what do I do? Because the thought of going on another day like this is unbearable, but at the same time the rational side of my brain like I mentioned earlier and tells me ""Your outta luck you have to"" I just want the constant fight to end and everything not be a pain in the rear. (if this wouldn't be the right place I am sorry, seemed like the right place to post this.)
Thank you guys for taking the time to read this. "
After I smoke the last bit of my weed I'm done.,Goodbye Reddit.
Did I break my brain four months ago?,At the end of April I tried to kill myself through alcohol poisoning. I ended up going to the hospital and having it flushed out of my system.I haven't been the same since that attempt. My depression has been worse and I've just lost my will to live. I wonder if I caused some sort of permanent damage to myself through my actions. It makes it even harder to hope for the future.
long story of my shitty life,"So this all started around 5 years ago when my great grandad died. I didn't know him very well as i was around 8 or 9 at the time but when he died all I remember is my mum lying with my dogs crying her eyes out. I now know this is because my mum didn't have a dad growing up so she saw him as one. my great grandad dying caused my mum to become heavily depressed which soon progressed into alcoholism.My mum being an alcoholic. it has been going on for around 5 years now but I will just tell you all the times I can remember that are significant. First one is around 3 - 4 years ago my mum got shit faced and left, we found her a few hours later (I say we but it was my brother and dad as i was 10) and she came back and yelled then passed out. second time was a repeat of 1 just around a year later (it happened a few times.) 6th time (biggest) it was November 5th and my family was throwing a bonfire for some friends of there's (they used to be mine but I will get to that) and we made a huge bonfire behind our house in a field but we left our mum and her friend because it was cold and they didn't vcare but by the time we had gotten back my mum had drank around 3-4 bottles of wine (the equivalent of a pint of JD) and was out of it. later that night there friends have gone, my brother was sleeping in my room because he was scared of my mum (as when me and my dad were directing our guests back as they were wattlking) she had being saying things to him like ""do you want to die"" (she was drunk) later that night we woke up to the sound of my mum banging and yelling at my dad ""Alan, I need a fucking wee"" then started throwing stuff and smashing stuff so my dad called the police and she was put in a drunk ward for a 12 hours. final one for now, it was around june and my brothers girlfriend was around and he had bought me some csgo keys and made me a coke and rum (i'm 14 so there was 10:1 coke to rum) and he had left like 100ml left and it was gone so he asked my mum and she started freaking out yelling at my brother girlfriend to get the fuck out of her house and that she is not welcome and the same at my brother and sines then (around 2 and a half months I have seen him once) and I had to spend the night at my mums friends house and she didn't pick up her phone and knowing how she is and what she has done before I thought she had slit her wrists and died this time.moving 200 miles away. After what happened my parents decided to move back to the north of england, moving closer to family I see once a year and 200 miles away from friends. I now have 1 friend ish and see my cousins once a week and am living with my grandma who is a compleat bitch (my family are still in nottingham and the reason i'm not friends with the other family is because of moving) Also school here is shit and all I do really is sit in the lessons, do all the work, do homework at lunch and come home and eat. basically my life has gone from worse to worse to worse and I truly believe there is nothing worth living for now  "
I ruined everything,"Im so selfish. I ignored the one friend i had and i did it like it was nothing, im so dumb i didnt even realize how lonely she was. So she forced herself to be someone else to fit in. I broke her. and i cant change it, now i feel like i should just vanish from her life so maybe she can be happy, and doesnt have to fake being my friend anymore. I just want to go back and fix it. i want my friend back. without her i feel like im nothing, she was the only person who was there for me. and my birthday is coming up and i dont want to have to ask her to go somewhere with me, it will be awkward and i will have to act happy and i cant handle it, im tired and i just want to fix things but i dont know how and im tired of trying im tired of this pain i just want someone to care for me but no one does no one does anymore because i hurt everyone around me. I lie and i act like im the victim and i dont know why. what is wrong with me, i convince myself i deserve happiness but i dont. Im just one of the millions of people in this world who will never do anything meaningful or anything to improve this planet or the people living in it, all i am is a burden getting in the way of people who might make difference in this world. What would even happen if im gone, a few people will shed a few tears, and people at school will pretend they were my friend and that they loved me when no one did, and no one even knew who i was. i mean who am i really hurting if i leave this world."
"""The road to recovery is winding""",is there really any point to trying anymore if I have to make it through the twists and turnsI can't stop crying. I can't eat. I can't sleep. Dammit I can't even smoke cigs. I constantly feel like throwing up. I don't have anyone I can talk to. I have been working so fucking hard for months and months and months and months and it has felt like a waste of time for too long. I'm getting tired. I've been self sabotaging and reckless and thats only made it worsewhat is the fucking point man
What is the fucking point?,"what is the fucking point?to be happy?  how?  why?  it doesn't last.  pain is the default and it always comes back.I've tried.  years I've tried.  pushed from one pill to the next so I can be numb enough to enjoy the rat race.gutted myself in front of every therapist until they feign empathy before taking my crumpled bills since they never accept my insurance.my clothes are made in sweatshops.  my food was tortured horrifically.  lawmakers are corrupt.  soldiers work for profit.  love is an illusion.  money is fake.  everything is a scam.  everyone lies.  everyone steals.  everyone hurts.  no one is innocent.  and it just keeps going.  and going.  and going...we're all just dumb pack animals who cling to routine and jump from one cycle to the next to keep ourselves busy and blind.so why continue?  what's the point?  because it ""gets better""?  why would anyone want to get better in such a crooked world?"
Injection?,I attempted suicide a while back and made a cocktail of medicine and injected it in my arm. It didn�۪t work. I got better temporarily. Now I need to go is there a way I can make it work this time.
What is the easiest way to kill yourself ?,what is the easiest way for a 15 y/o to kill himself without much pain ?
I'll end it on my 16. birthday.,"I don't have any motivation to live. I'm self confident, I have lots of friends, I'm intelligent and I'm not ugly. But i can't do this anymore. Our lifes have no goal and we are so tiny compared to the whole galaxy. Life is too boring without weed or alcohol. I will kill myself because I have absolutely no patience and motivation to do this for still around 70 years. And whats the difference to the world when I kill myself ? I can do it so quick and afterwards I can't even care about the other people that are still in this world. Also I'm just really curious about what happens after our lifes. If we become just nothing it's okay because i won't even realize it. And if theres some kind of afterlife it won't be as bad as this boring world. I guess I'm just an egoistic, arrogant, lazy, and depressed asshole that is really curious. "
Why is it hard to open up to people?,"I want to open up to someone, a friend, about my suicidal thoughts but I don�۪t want to be any inconvenience. I don�۪t want them to think of me differently. I don�۪t want them constantly asking me if I�۪m okay."
I feel like I want to just die,"I was born in a third world country, and I was also a secondary class citizen. All of my life I always cry, to the point that I'm too emotional to be considered a man. I immigrated to America, when I turned 15 and so far I've been trying to build my social life that I never had. I don't have many friends, and I never had a relationship with a girl cause I'm not attractive physically or mentally. I feel like everything I endured was just pointless, and had no meaning. I always wish that I get cancer, or die in an accident, or in a shooting. "
What can i do...?,"I'm 18, and my whole life i felt like i am worthless. i just recently started talking about it, and everyone thinks i'm a fucking idiot.
My parents tell me that they tried everything, and always ask why do i feel this way. They think im an idiot.  i've been through several psychologists, and all they tell me is that it all depends on you, you choose how you feel. since i was 12, ive been through several failed suicide attempts, and everyday i think about how thats the best choice for me.
I've pushed everyone out of my life. I had a girlfriend and friends, and a social life, but every single one of the people i loved left me, or i pushed them out of my life. I am on the last year of high school which i fucking hate, and im not even sure if i'm able to finish it at all.
I literally have no one to talk to...
Every year, every month, every week, every day, i just feel emptier and shittier. i think about last year, and im like fuck, it was so much better. back then, i was thinking about the year before, and i was life fuck, it was so much better, and so on...
Like i said, im 18, but holy fuck, thinking that i have to life at least yet another 18 years scares the living fuck out of me.
I don't know what to do...
today i gave myself a month, if nothing changes, thats it, im not gonna fucking fail this time...
Every time someone tell me that 'oh, its just in your head, everything depends on you, you choose how you feel', i think about a guy i knew, who killed himself a year ago. yep, he definitely chose that, you know. just like i choose to feel emptier each year, for no good reason.Sorry for the long rant"
I was going to kill myself over loneliness.,"Through several accounts, I've posted on SuicideWatch several times in my life. Earlier this month, I was destined to end my life. Loneliness and depression were killing me, and fast. I thought of myself as worthless and destined to fail. I was counting down the days.But I found someone.I met him. He has similar issues to me - and we realized how similar we are. How relatable we are. And we love each other. And nothing can change that. I'm so proud to say I'm alive, and finally . Thank you for motivating me to live and stay optimistic. "
Cutting myself,"These past few years, ive been depressed and have an irge to cut myself and maybe do anything to make me feel something.
But the urge of cutting only comes when im really really down to the point of wanting to die. Im not religious, but im still scared of commiting the greatest sin. Ending one's life. And this not really wanting any scars on my body. i even consider cutting myself on places that people won't see. But then ill have a thought about me with someone. What if he sees it? Maybe i just dont want to give them any evidences.
Im just afraid that my fear of commiting the greatest sin and having a scar would no longer stop me for killing myself.
I know my parents love me, but theyre kind of toxic. They call me crazy sometimes. Even if im having a good day, its always perfect timing bec before the day ends, they would ruin it for me. And we are not the type who shares what we feel.."
"Giving things a last chance. If it fails, it's over. I can't handle all this.","Here is what i have to face everyday,Meet the hell that's my life. I am 15 years old and I've seen, done and went through too much for my age. Far too much to say i'm okay.At age 5, I witnessed my mother being severely beat by her ex-bf. Also, i saw the relationship between her and my grandmother quickly turn sour so add more violence. I saw my mother beat my grandma, and it was so bad i had to call 911 and the police officer had to lock me alone in a police car. And we lived in a ghetto area, so often times there was gang violence and regular shootings and breaking and entering. Additionally, since my mother was single i was left alone for hours at a time at a daycare, where i was regularly abused in a physical manner.
Age 6, we move in with my mother's now ex-bf. Cue him regularly beating my mother, and his children doing the same towards me. Seriously, one of them fucking threw kittens down a two story drop.
At age 7, i was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. This caused me to nearly fail the 2nd grade. I also had severe amnesia, causing me to forget simple things as tying my shoes, or remembering the months of the year, what time/date is was and such.
At age 8, my condition got worse. I was a regular visitor at the hospital, and i could now detect seizures coming on. And since my mother became ill, it became very hard to work. Therefore, food became scarce, we didn't have power so we had to plug our fridge into our apartment hallway and such. And while her boyfriend was very rich, he REFUSED to help in any way. At that time, mom called it quits and moved out.
Age 9, i was raped by a neighborhood teenager. He took me into a park area at our apartment behind a bush and had his way with me. And we got evicted, so we had to move again. My mother cut off the two closet people to us, making it harder. (My grandma because they were a toxic combination together, and my auntie for no reason at all)
Age 10-11. Some good news is that i started to recover from my seizures. I also gained a little brother and a (step)dad who loves me exactly as a son. Also, the reason my mom was sick because of an allergy to potatoes. I think my mother had an issue with her left ovary, causing her to internally bleed out 4 liters of blood. I think it was cyst that burst, however i'll ask mom tomorrow to elaborate. I was also was blackmailed by a stranger over the internet to show my intimate parts and do stuff to myself.
Age 12-14. My mother shows her true narcissistic colors. During this time, i was severely emotionally abused, and was beat once. Did i mention stepdad joined in once as well? I was told so many things, that i was worthless, abusive, manipulative etc. I was also beat often at my school, and had my nose shattered by a bully. I was sent into a deep depression and i became suicidal. My mother claims to have tried to find help, but ran away once they explained that since i wanted to die they needed to report to social services. Since they'd put 2 + 2 together and take me from her she fled. She claims she did because they laughed at her. She also broke down my door while threatening to kill me.
15+. I stand up to nmom so therefore i got promptly kicked out. She smashed dishes, told my 5 year old brother i was worthless and since my stepdad stood up for me he also gets kicked out. We came back a week later. I've confronted her a few times and she tried to manipulate me but it didn't work, as I've gotten very good at seeing manipulation. I also report her to social services, and since i'm trying to get out i reach out to my bio dad. Turns out he's like my mom so he tries to say lies to make him into the victim. He's a deadbeat and always has been. I also get hit by a car, causing my grades to plummet, and me basically switching personalities. Heck, it's legit hard to try and mop, or find something in front of me. I'm now hot headed and i get very confused easily. It's very hard to understand many basic tasks. I also got beat up by a bully again and now i have emotional trauma that's triggered by me being hit in anyway.Since i fail to get help, nmom gets some of her friends to poke fun at me with her twisted lies. So, real fun. I also recognize that i am bisexual and came out and also that i'm transgender which has been nothing short of hard. Because of me not transiting even after i told my parents has sent me into another deep suicidal depression. So, I've made another letter to my parents. I've got nowhere else to turn. I can't even get myself out of the wrong body. This Friday, i will give them a very detailed note of what i am forced to suffer everyday as trans and without support. So, here's the note...Mom, do you happen to remember a letter I gave you back in June, where I told you that I'm transgender? Well, here it is again but I hope I don't have to say it again. This will be the last letter I give you. Since I told you and dad, my mental health sharply declined, as I was not being supported at all through this. You could be forgiven the first time, but I hope you see how exactly this affects me every single day, however I really need you to see that ignoring my feelings is the WORST thing you could do. I'm not okay, at all, and I hope I can change that together with you. Here is my reasoning, and what you need to know about my emotional situation. Understand that this is the furthest thing from a phase. I was born with this, how and why exactly and I must get support now. - I often curl up in my bed, wishing how I'd wake up a girl tomorrow. I'm too exhausted about this to tear up about it. - When I look in the mirror, it stings me emotionally. I am not male, and when I see my male body in the mirror, it's like being jabbed through the heart. It hurts, as I do not belong as male. I am female, beyond a doubt. - I've been suicidal these past few months. I can no longer deal with this alone, and I can't live like this anymore. It's fucking hell. Ignoring me, having me suffer in silence is hell. I wish to end it, maybe then I'd be reborn as female, and therefore happy in my own body. Did I mention that the suicide rates among trans teens for 30 percent, and 42 percent for self harm? That's for a reason. - Did I mention I hate my nude body? Honestly, when I see my dick, or little mustache I always feel a jolt of pain go through me, reminding me of the situation that I was born like this. - Speaking of my dick, I hate that too. Since I'm female, I try to tuck it in, and make it feel somewhat like a vagina. When I do that, the burden goes away JUST for a little while. - The sole reason I like to do girly things like, cross-dress, wear makeup, gossip and such is because those are what girls do. It reminds me of who I really am, and helps me emotionally. - From the very start of puberty, I've always had a nagging thought I was a girl. I would cup my man boobs and imagine them as real boobs. I always felt like I should have female parts, and therefore be a girl. This isn't sexual at all, but actually a sign of gender dysphoria. - I'm extremely unhappy as a boy. It's miserable, as I'm a woman trapped in a man's body. Also relevant, it's been documented and studied that actors who play roles of the opposite gender actually have signs of gender dysphoria when they play as the opposite gender! - If I had one button that would turn my body completely female, guess who would press it? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that that. I'm very depressed too. Often I'm fucking miserable and I don't have the energy to do anything. I have many goals I want to achieve, but when my mind is crippled like this it's too hard. The reason why I spend lots of time on my computer, is there I can be totally seen as female. In my mind, being called Jennifer gives me a massive wave of euphoria and happiness. But, the reverse is true if I'm called Jaden. - Some habits I've developed are that I prefer to urinate sitting down, as hey that's not what boys do. In video games, I always pick a female character as I easily imagine myself, in that game as a woman. - I have constant fantasies about living life as female. Never EVER a boy. So, that's the end of what I have to say about my thoughts and feelings, for which I have suffered from alone these past few years. I know reading this will shock you, and I know you will need time to accept this but understand that I've been going through this alone. What is harder in the long run? You living in bliss, unaware of how I am, or helping me through this? This is not a phase, and I know it. This is also the hardest thing that I am still going through, and I cannot get myself out of this pit alone. If you are unsure, take this letter to a gender therapist who works with trans youth. The therapist will tell you exactly what you need to know, and the therapist is a licensed professional. And don't be afraid to approach me for advice. I know it's going to be hard, but we must help each other during this time. Also, another thing I suggest, why not ask some transgender people on the internet on what to do. Since they speak from experience going through what I am dealing with, it can't hurt and they can speak from my perspective. Remember, there is zero way I can be happy unless I receive support. But please, do not ignore this. This must be dealt with now. I'm desperate to transition, suicidal because I can't do so without you and too depressed and miserable even if I tried. Here is some of my advice. - Take time to understand and accept this. I know the loss of a son will be hard, but you lose the fake show of me being a man, and get to see the real show, starring Jennifer! - Talk to some transgender people who can speak from my point of view. They may not be professional therapists, but they can give you lots of helpful advice. If you are interested, here is the link.  - Approach a therapist that works with transgender youth. I think you should give them this letter and see what they say. - I know this one will be uncomfortable for you and Dad, and he even said it but refer to me as Jennifer. Heck, that's the name I've already picked out for myself once I transition. Use female pronouns, treat me as a girl simply because I am. Remember, I am a girl but in a male body. I am female, no doubt in my mind. A gesture as simple as that would mean the world to me. It's the small things that give you away. Mom and dad, I know what you might think. However you are not knowledgeable about this subject, and therefore it would definitely be best to find a gender therapist who can help me, and educate you about this topic.As you can see, i'm not ready to give up despite everything. Not yet. But now, if i fail to receive support i don't know where i can go, and what i can do. I can't handle this. It's awful, the weight and trauma on my shoulders. "
Advice,"Hey, so i'm going through a terrible time. I'm a manic depressive and my girlfriend broke up with me recently, i feel she is my soulmate. I have cheated on her in the past when i was unmedicated, i'm not using mental health to excuse my terrible behaviour and i would do anything to change it. She says she needs a break, but cheated on me with a friend. I totally understand this as she is not over what i did to her and i wish her well. She says she is optimistic we can make it work but only after she's found herself and we are still friends. I miss her so much and am literally waiting for her to come back. I have no idea what will happen if she doesn't. It fucking hurts so much to imagine her hands on him, and whilst i forgive her i have never felt worse. I have bought all of this on myself and it's never been this bad for me. Someone help please"
When I was younger I'd listen to music in the dark and think about the future. But doing that today only reminds of how good life was back then... When I gazed on the stars and not into the darkness.,You taken any steps towards that future?
I just need to talk someone who feel similair,"I wish I was never born, or that I could sleep forever. Even when I'm ''happy'' I just would rather not be anything at all, if that makes sense. I don't like the world, I absolutely hate myself, and I find it difficult to talk to people, because they will just focus a lot on making sure I don't do it. Thanks for reading this. "
"I feel so lonely every day but actively try and close myself in and keep away from people cause I'm depressed. But I understand why people aren't reaching out to me, I wouldn't talk to me if I were someone else",I'm very cold and don't speak that much. I didn't before either but then I didn't try and push away people in a dissregarding way. Like if there is some basic reluctance of some sort to talk with them.I don't know what I should do...
I'm going to do it.,"In march, I almost successfully killed myself. This is grim but the feeling I felt when my body was shutting down was like a relief compared to how I'd been feeling prior. I want everything to end, I've tried to hard to express to the mental health services that I'm a liability to myself and yet I'm STILL forced to wait. I can't wait any more, I think I need to do this. This year has been beyond cruel to me, I lost all my friends, my longtime partner and now am being accused of accusations I don't even want to mention. Being demonized beyond any reconciliation is just... too much. I tried, so hard. I pushed through all these months in hopes things would improve, it didn't. I've never been so alone, it just shows I truly have no place here. And it doesn't stop, it's one thing after another that just breaks me down over and over again... I just want to sleep, forever.
My life is going no where, my efforts are wasted and I lack the ability to form strong bonds with people.I'm going to die alone, how fucking pathetic. This is nonsensical rambling but I just need to get it out either as my subconsciousness trying to seek help or just... leave something  behind. I don't know any more. Sorry for this mess of a post, I'm not well."
I wan't to die,"I wan't to die, because i am fat, my life sucks and i am depressed. so i want to suicide. But in Norway it's not easy to get a gun. I wan't to die painless. What do i do."
I honestly will never understand why everyone keeps telling me suicide isn't the answer,"Somewhere on the Internet a few years ago I read that the probability of coming into existence is 1 in 400 trillion, I'm the result of thousands of people having sex with the right person at the right time for me to come into existence, one small detail 100.000 or 25 years ago could've made my existence impossible. While I know that my life is a miracle, I can't help but think of suicide. I've been suffering from chronic depression forever. My life is an ocean of sadness, I always tried to keep on being positive when one day: it was raining, I was looking out the window, my boyfriend and I stayed home. We both took a day off from work. I was thinking of how lonely, sad, unfulfilled and hopeless I was feeling, despite being loved, despite having the perfect family, a really good-looking guy who loved me, good friends... but I still felt unfulfilled and empty. I broke up with him, that was the moment I gave up on my optimism, from that moment I became hard to be around, and our relationship ended. I still have my friends who are aware of my condition, they respect the fact that I'm not always in the right mood to try to have fun and go out, but I feel lonely... hopeless. Nothing keeps me happy. You know, life is a miracle yes, but sometimes one just runs out of resources for coping with the pain. Think of life like a business in this case: when there are no resources to keep it going, all you have to do is give up on it. I don't want to live anymore. Yesterday I spent my Saturday night at home, and I looked out of the window... I didn't jump because I didn't feel ready but the thought of it didn't really scare me at all, it was actually comforting. I think I'll do it in three months, I have a date, I won't regret '' shutting my business down ''."
"I'm so lonely, it physically hurts.",What should I do?I just want the pain to stop.
Someone help me to kill myself with carbon monoxide,"I've done my research and concluded that carbon monoxide seems to be the least painful method of suicide out there, but only if done correctly. I just need help with setting everything up and having the right specs etc to ensure I have a peaceful death I already know that the CO has to be as pure as possible to avoid a feeling of suffocation. What I need to know is things like:
What ppm of Carbon Monoxide should I get?
What size should the cylinder be/ how many litres are necessary?
What specs should I have for the room I'm doing it in (A medium sized garage)?
Anything else you can think of that would ensure my death be painless and certain
Thank you in advance."
"Mind deteriorating, body feels numb occasionally, thoughts pop up and don't go away for hours at a time","Unsure why anymore, it's been so long I can't track down why I feel sad. Whenever I seek help from whatever I had left of friends, they assume I'm joking and just messing with them, and say I'm fucked up and spread rumors that I'm an attention seeking sociopath and it scared me from talking to people I know personally.I'm scared to call/text professional help because I'm afraid police will come to my location and my parents would know and I'm not ready for thatI have a bad relationship with them, I never talk to them about serious things and they never ask, for 5years it's been like thatWhat do I do "
"I'm 18 [M]. alone and ugly, I've had suicidal thoughts for the last 4 years.","My teeth are crooked, I have glasses, my face is somewhat disproportionate and all my friends make jokes about my appearance all the time. I haven't had a girlfriend since 2013 and even she was embarrassed to be with me, so much so that she broke up with me by telling one of my friends to inform me of the fact because she didn't want to be seen with me.At this point I don't know what to do, since that time I've had suicidal thoughts but never as much as now, I'm the only one of my friends that is a virgin and it seems like every girl I meet instantly judges me based on my appearance, which I don't even blame them for because I am pretty ugly if I do say so myself.
I love being myself but it seems like nobody else likes it when I am. I'm a musician but all my friends hate my music and my voice which doesn't exactly help my self esteem too much, I'm also unemployed and in every job interview I've gone to the interviewer acts like they aren't going to hire me because I don't look good. I can't even get into the college course I want to take because my math grades are too low because of my stupid dyscalculia math disorder. I also drink and use drugs heavily too attempt to temporarily remove my problems but it seems the things that I do while under the influence always make my friends hate me slightly more, in fact I'm typing this while drunk out of my goddamn mind at almost 6 am at this moment.Honestly I have no idea what to do at this point. I've set a goal for myself that if I'm still a virgin/alone at 21 that I'm just going to kill myself. What's the point of living if only your parents love you and you have no companionship of your own? I don't even have any hopes of having children in the future either. What woman would want to have a child that grows up to have my fucked teeth and eyes? I certainly don't want to subject another human to this mental abuse no matter how accepting our world becomes in the future. What the fuck am I supposed to do?"
I feel so damn lonely and I don't know what to do.,"I am crying as im typing this I just really can't take this feeling anymore I may as well give out why I feel this way. My father was abusive to my mother and I grew up around a dysfunctional household when I was 7 my father finally left I was ""happy"" I guess back then I thought to myself I was strong enough to deal with it but as I grew older I realised not having a father figure really hurts. I feel like my mom took care of me and my sister really well (sister is is going to NYU) but I feel like I have dissapointed her I always gave her trouble ever since elementary school I dropped out of private school from bad grades in 6th grade so I moved to a public school made a lot of friends I mainly hanged out with the nerdy type kids but even there I felt left out at times I felt like they never did like me in their group (This is where I started developing social anxiety) after maybe 4 months I stopped going to middle school completely and I somehow got into high school (I guess it just wasn't worth the hassle to keep me there) I never did go to high school maybe for 3 months and at that point I felt like I was finally overcoming my social anxiety and depression but then as I was walking back home from school I got mugged by a couple of big kids (they were seniors I was a freshman) at that point I just couldn't take it anymore I thought to myself after all this time of feeling like complete garbage and finally overcoming it the world throws me a big ""fuck you"" so I stopped going to school for maybe 2 years after giving my mom so much trouble I guess she thought I needed more ""extreme measures"" (I knew she was doing it because she cared about me but I fought over the idea) so I was sent to a therapeutic foster home the first home I went to I went to school everyday (even got myself on the honor roll somehow) but then I got into a fight with another foster kid living there so I was moved to a second home and over there I feel i've felt my worst the parents there did not like me at all they would talk behind my back and even in front of me of how ""bad"" of a kid I am and I just couldn't take it anymore there were countless times where I told the people that overlooks the foster home of how shit I feel there but I couldn't leave... So I did the only thing I could do and that was running away I ran smoked some marijuana I bummed off of a homeless man and slept in a bathroom (that's how badly I wanted to stay away from the foster home) the next day I got a call and got locked in a psychiatric ward where I met people I guess I would consider ""friends"" and I was happier but being locked in a psychiatric ward for a few months just made me want to be outside I even met a girl in there that I got along with and liked (we had alot of the same problems) got into a sort of relationship I guess with her (I know bad idea) but my second to last day there she just told me she liked someone else in there I was pretty hurt and I didn't even thing about it and just started cutting my wrists the next day I was  discharged but I hid the scars so I could get out and now (2017) I've been feeling a lot better about myself just got a job and less anxiety when talking to people but for some reason I still feel SO lonely, coming home I guess is the hardest part...No friends or family to talk to, No one to hear my stupid jokes, no one to even hear how lonely I am..."
Killing myself tonight (update),I can't do it cuz I'm just a fucking bitch. Turns out it's a lot harder to shoot yourself in the mouth than I thought. The human survival instinct is fucking cruel.
Can anyone convince me that this world isn't just a cold and uncaring place and that life is actually worth living?,My Empty Record Message
this is the last chance,"I have no hope, I can't control my emotions and I know nobody understands how I feel and nobody can help me, I don't want to live anymore and there isn't really anything stopping me from overdosing right now to make it stop "
"I have nothing left, I'm a user and a piece of shit.","I woke up this morning to the best friend I've ever had pointing out all the ways I'm a fake piece of shit, that I'm self centered and only pretend to care about others for personal gain. And she's right, I've denied it every other time I've been told the same things but her explanation made me realize I have to stop lying to myself. I have no one anymore. I have maybe 2 or 3 friends I can go to anymore, no family, and a shit job that overworks me that I'll probably be fired from soon because my depression makes me as slow as fuck. I've had no home since I was 17, a high school dropout, an addict, I just see no way of my life getting better anytime soon. And my entire life has only gotten worse the older I get. The first time I tried killing myself was at 8 fucking years old, I can't even count how many times I've tried after that. All I do anymore is work, sleep, and think of the quickest way to go out."
No Point of Living Anymore,"I'm 17 and still in high school. No friends, no girlfriend, nobody talks to me at all during school. Tried crisis text lines about 20 times and they're all worthless piles of shit. Nobody gives a shit about me so why continue living. I don't give a fuck what my family thinks about me. I'm starting to think it won't matter what my family will think because I'll be dead and won't have to worry anymore. They can handle without me anyway. I just want to kill myself so I can finally be known. "
I've never been this depressed in my life,"My depression is totally untreatable . I wish I lived in Belgium where assisted suicide for untreatable mental illness is a thing. I can't take anymore. I'm ending it on Saturday . I've made my final decision . Not exactly at peace, just so sick and tired of suffering and crying. Of being told I am a burden by my family and friends. Too miserable to be around. Being told by religious people that the reason I'm still depressed, despite all I prayed and prayed when I was younger, that God is punishing me for something and for not being devoted enough. Fuck that. I'm so done of being a goddamn loser and burden on society . The world will for sure be a better place without me. 11 years of therapy and countless meds, you'd think SOMETHING would have helped. My last relationship disintegrated partly due to my mental illness, partly because I'm ugly and fucking boring. Im such a waste of space. I've been so broken to a point of no return. "
Think I'm going to kill myself this week,"I'm 19, female and I've finally gave up the fight against my depression and anxiety.. been fighting for so long I just can't do it anymore. I no longer enjoy doing anything and spend my days either sleeping as much as I can as it's the closest I can get to death or sitting in my room alone, gave up with seeing my friends it's been 2 months since I've seen anyone apart from my family who I live with.. that's another reason I want to kill myself, my poor family have to put up with me taking out my feelings on them.. unlike my ex boyfriend who chose to leave me, they can't so their forced to listen to it. I know my family love me and I love them so much, but I think it would be for the best. I'm so confused I want to die I can't stop crying, every minute awake I'm wishing I could go back to sleep.. no one actually thinks I will kill myself so they don't bother really trying to make me feel better, all i'd need is someone to push me and to really help me but i don't have that. I guess i'm here hoping for someone to give me a reason to live, i have thought through and realise that death is forever but we're all going to die someday anyways so why does it matter :( "
I just couldn't do it,"Life's been shit. Since a long time. I have grown frustrated over the past few weeks. Sometimes, I just hurt myself. Slap myself, hit myself, because I am angry, and everything just seems to be my fault. My family is totally unsupportive, and I don't want to tell them about this, mainly cuz they're the reason behind all this.
I wanted to kill myself today. But I couldn't. I had a knife in my hand, but I just couldnt. Images of my best friend popped in front of me, and I just dont wanna see her sad. I just couldn't "
I'm obsessed with finding out how to kill myself now since the last time I tried. It felt really calming thinking I might die and I want to feel that again. How do I break that mindset.,Kudos to you that you are already wanting to break that mindset - that takes something. Are you seeing a psychologist?Other then that - do you want to talk about what happened to bring you here?
What's the point of living if you're only suffering?,I've never felt happy in my entire life.My existence has been just a mix of loneliness and pain.Why should I go on?For the hypothetical chance that it  get better one day?I already feel that I'm too old for anything.I've missed out on so many things.I can't go back in time.Fuck this life and fuck this universe.
Suicidal teen,"Hey I'm 15 and I'm having strong suicidal thoughts. I'm depressed, have social anxiety and emotionally abused. I just want to die. I don't want to live. I have no reason to continue. Someone please give me a reason not to just overdose? I'm so tired of fighting this. "
I don't deserve a painless suicide. I deserve to hurt.,"Title pretty much sums it up. I'm a disgusting coward whose whole life has centered around avoiding pain and conflict. I always play things safe because I'm terrified of risk taking.I never invite people out or try to build friendships with acquaintances because I'm afraid of being shot down. I never go on social media because I can't handle the pain of seeing others have dynamic social lives. I dont exercise enough because of how much it hurts. Bottom line is I'm a fucking spineless pussy who will never get the body or social skills he wants. I have nothing to offer the world because ive run away from it for so long. I think I should kill myself in the most brutal way possible to make sure that I experience all of the pain that I was too weak to handle in life. I had a sheltered upbringing, no abuse or traumatic experiences, my parents pay for me to piss away my time at college so I dont even have financial stress. I have had a laughably easy life and yet I'm still overwhelmed and miserable. Realistically I should have died long ago. I'm 20 years old now, an adult child, and I think its too late to fundamentally change myself into a brave person who can go after what he wants. I fled from pain for my entire childhood, I want to experience true pain at least once before I die. Any ideas for a super painful method would be appreciated. Thanks."
In the ER,I tried to OD and die and now here I am...
I'm lonely,"I feel pretty lonely. I can't find any friends I can get along with or relate to and it makes me hate myself and want to fucking die. It's hard to find someone that I can trust or someone that isn't annoying or nuts. Everyone also loves talking shit about me. I partially want to keep pushing on, but I also just want to take the easy way out and die. Do you have any advice that could help me out? "
Don't want to be suicidal,"Part of what I write may seem far-fetched but it's very real and it's a crippling issue for me.I'm 19 and in college. I've had a very mediocre and unfulfilling social life, and almost since elementary I can recall always feeling lonely. This in turn caused me to be very shy around anyone I didn't know so I would stay cooped up at home playing video games. By high school I just couldn't help but always feel shitty and lonely. I had a small group of friends who I'd play games with but it never changed how I feel. I don't know how to even properly express myself. On top of all this loneliness I found out I drew the short straw below the belt. All the social media jokes, girls I've met who made fun of people below the built not hung has taken an even bigger tole on me because any hope I had of approaching a girl I immediately try to get out of my mind because I don't want to know what will happen if any girl I met emotionally destroyed me because of something out of my control. On top of all this I can't for the life of me bring myself to enjoy anything. I feel like I've grown up to just not enjoy anything but be a lazy loser. I go to the gym and I'm in shape but that's almost a temporary relief. I also feel I'm at an age where the way I am is almost set in stone. So I'm doomed to be a living waste who just does nothing. I just feel like people out there have much more valid reasons to want to be suicidal, but here I am entertaining this idea. I've already thought about what I would write, where I would do it, How I'd do it. I just cannot help but feel lonely at all times and it's killing me at this point."
"There's no point, literally.","Life is the most pointless thing for me. I work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week and I'm only 18 years old. I have no mom, dad, or family to yalk or fall back on. The city I'm in is full of people who only care for themselves leaving me with no friends. I have no passions and whenever I'd like to develop some interest.... I get home from working 14 hours and just pass out from exhaustion. And all this is taught me is life is fucking pointless. I get to work my whole life to get to work. I have no family to even share this life with and don't want to bring children in this disgusting world of us vs them. This life is nothing but stress after stress, payment after payment. No one loves me. Everyone is gone and every one else is too busy to want to care about me. I don't even care about me. I never eat and am constantly high because all i do is work so, fuck it might as well get high any chance i can get. Whats shitter is I'm to scared of pain to do anything, so i just cry and beg to die. "
Killing myself tonight.,"I'm just bitching for my sake, I don't expect any responses. I just don't have anyone to talk to anymore, so this shit just builds up inside of me.I guess it's finally come to this. I've been depressed for about 7 years now and have been suicidal for damn near all of them...I guess I am finally giving in to these thoughts. I completely hate who I am in every way, and seeing myself in the mirror is just a constant reminder of the failure of a person that I am. The only thing that I have really managed in life is getting good grades at a good school. But I've given up basically everything to get there. I've lost all of my closest friends, and I've lost (although I never had any...) of my social skills. I don't know how to make friends anymore, and I don't know how to hold a conversation with another person. I've never had a girlfriend either for that matter. I'm just a fucking loser. I'm not good at anything, and I don't have any good relationships.I used to have a very close friend. I met her not too long after I started feeling depressed, and I have been very open with her about how I feel. She knows more about me than anyone...I've told her everything. She's the only person I've ever been able to be myself around. My friendship with her was the greatest thing to have ever really happened to me...I can never put into words how much she meant to me....But we haven't talked for almost a year now, and I'm hurting and I'm dead inside. I haven't been able to feel like myself...I think about her everyday, but she's already moved on to other things.I've lost all interest in my major, and I have no self-esteem or confidence to really go talk to people to make friends or get a girlfriend or any of that shit. I'm alone and without direction. There's this cute girl in my physics class that I met last semester, it's a shame that I'm too damn boring of a person to hold a conversation and completely lack the self-confidence to really go after her, in a sense. Ah well, she can do much better anyways.Sorry this is long, just trying to get a couple more things off my chest...I've already written and sent off my goodbyes to my family, so I don't have anywhere else to keep spitting out what's on my mind. I hope I find peace tonight."
How can I stop thinking of suicide as a 16yo?,"HeyIm 16Last year i got depresse as hell. Bad grades, friends lost, nothing learned, videogames addiction, wasted time.Nothing felt alright. Its better now but not great.I wnat to kms. But I dont want to lose my parents, my brother. I just get happy from talking to them, from seeing them. I feel like they love me and i dont want to see how they would get if i die.I need to get the suicide ideia out of my head. PLease help"
Suicide over breakup grief,"I broke up with my girlfriend over religion and long distance and now she is with another guy.
I feel like I wanna end it all. I want no more pain.
The pain of regret and guilt and the pain of never being happy again. I just dont see the point in continuing. I want to end it. It has been two months since the breakup.
Please God forgive me"
I'm so dumb,"I feel like such a disgrace, I was so drunk last night I sent pictures to guys.I'm young, what if they screenshotted the pictures. When I die I'll only be known as the whore."
Living hurts,"Cutting doesnt hurt, dying doesnt hurt. I want it to stop"
Feel suicidal but not depressed,"I have been thinking about suicide for almost one year. But I don't think I am depressed, I just want to die. I still have good sleep and good appetite everyday, however, I don't know the meaning of life. This two days this thought get even stronger, I search for different ways to commit suicide and find out their success rates cause I want to ensure that I will die in the first attempt. I even decide the place and time for me to do this. When I thinking about all this, I still live my normal life. I go to university, chatting with my friends and playing video games. I am quite happy with all these.I think I have rational thoughts and I am not depressed. I just don't want to live anymore. I think that everyone will think of commit suicide in some of their hard times, I am not experiencing hard time. Instead I have quite a peaceful life."
I cannot stop thinking about ending my own life,"What I mean is that, logically, I know it doesn't make sense at all. I have a good life. Loving partner, supportive family. Roof over my head. But I'm also absolutely sure no one actually wants me around. That I don't really want me around, they just tolerate me because I can do things for them. Outside my utility, I'm worthless. I lost my job 2 months ago, so I've had plenty of time to think about it. To act on it even. The only reason I aborted my last attempt was because I vividly pictured my partner finding my dead body and I just can't do that to her. But I just can't handle this worthless, pointless feeling in my mind anymore. I'm so tired of fighting it and death seems better and better. I might be able to see my doctor in 2-3 days. My therapist is advocating for me to go on stronger antidepressant medications and an anti anxiety, and I think it will help. I just have to make it there but being alive, in my head is so painful"
Please let me die,"I had a date last night, and we talked for four hours. Every guy I date ghosts me. I think it is really me now. I hate how I am. Outspoken, too passionate.  I wish I could just be normal and not put people off. The last few days I really just want to die.I am just worthless and no one is ever going to want me. I am 33 and my looks are fading and I am just ugly.Please just let me die. I just want to never wake up anymore and face a horrible future."
I feel trapped,"It's only 1 and a half weeks into university and I'm already losing it. I can't focus on anything I don't know what happened to me. I'm sick of constantly fucking things up, I'm sick of being lonely. I'm on my last razor and I'm out of bandaids and cleaning wipes and I'm debating doing away with the whole sanitizing thing after self harm. I want to die and just avoid being a failure, washing out and going back to my small town and working a shit job like my dad. I just want to fucking kill myself and I can't because all I see is my sister crying at my funeral and I'm trapped I can't take this anymore I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I'm slipping, I'm in a new city, I have like 2 friends and everyone else just thinks I'm annoying. I can't even look in the mirror anymore without hating myself and I can't work up the motivation to go to the gym or eat a salad. Therapy hasn't worked for me and I don't know if it's gonna work here or not. I just want that sweet release of death, just end it all now, get it over with, but I can't and I feel trapped in a life I don't even want to live anymore. "
I'm worried I'm going to hurt myself,"Hope it's okay to post this here. I don't normally hang around this part of reddit, and I just googled for this kind of sub.Things are not going so well for me here. In my usual way I made things much worse with things I said to my wife and someone else this evening.I feel a gut-wrenching loneliness, hopelessness, and despair. I want my life to be over.Thanks for reading."
Tick Tock...,"I'm getting so close to just saying, ""No more."" My chest physically hurts. People around me believe it's their fault I'm like this. It's not. I'm so done. I really really just want to die. It doesn't ""fix"" anything. I know, I know. I want to break it off and be gone the day after. School or work or relationship. I'm broken and alone."
On the edge of life and death...,"Recently my boyfriend broke up with me, it would have almost been 3 years, I expected this to happened... Though it seems it's the drop that makes me go crazy right now. I have zero friends or social skills, I'm an alcoholic and I have zero passion or goals in life. It's really depressing. I've been ""just living"" for the past 4 years or so. Not really doing anything proactive. Just drinking myself to coma every night. Oh and I moved city for him, because of his school... I started school too but now I think it'll be too much. He was my only friend, the only person I talked to... Now I'm entirely lonely in this new city that I don't know. I'm really thinking about killing myself, it hurts so much. Tried before, but didn't have the courage, but now I think the pain is present enough to do it... "
Help...,I cant kill myself cause i'm afraid of pain... whats the easiest way to take suicide without getting hurt...
I don't know!,"No offense here. It's just how i feel.When i was a kid, i used to believe that older means smarter and better. Kid is older than me? Of course he is right about everything. Adults? They are saint! They never lie and know everything! I'm dumb, you say? Guess i'm dumb, alright.But then i realized. It's all a lie. Well, most of it. School certainly was a useless lie. And teachers are very munipalitive pieces of shit that care only about their paycheck. Who i thought were the best are actually the worst.Somehow i finished school. Then got pushed into college. Took a part-time job. Almost died numerous times, or, i thought i almost died. Near graduation my head got completely wild and i seeked help.Anxiety, depression, possibly cyclothymia. They can't really unravel  this ravel. All i know is that i will certainly never attend any kind of normie legal job cause fuck government, it's because of it i broke. Same goes for military and hospitalization. Cause i will either run away or kill everybody there. I can draw and write decently, so maybe patreon is a way to go, but...I have no fucking idea what i am. What i like. What i feel. I thought i was straight, but i only liked the delusion of straightness. I thought i was a cool creative person, but i hate drawing as often as i absolutely love it, with no rhyme or reason. I don't know if i like games or anime even. I just hate everything and want to die. Or i just hate everything and want to kill everything? Or i want to kill everything because i love it and want to free it from suffering? argh, completely lost it again."
Asking for help was the hardest thing I've ever done. Psych ward questions.,"Basically,  I'm Chronically ill, my life hasn't gone as planned,  and my meds aren't right. I've tried them all except MAOI which I cannot at this time afford to be on because I have EDNOS. I've had 2 nervous breakdowns in the past two weeks.  Today shit hit the fan after being told over and over to kill myself on social media,  and it doesn't bother me,  what other people think,  because that's asinine to tell anybody,  but it reinforced that I have a problem that I've been too afraid to address. I talked to my best friend,  who,  I've saved his life.  I love him so much, but only in a platonic way,  which is the most painful type of love for both parties.  He's my brother from another mother, and as much as I love him,  it's too odd to think about being with him,  because I'm not sexually attracted to him,  anyway this is off topic.  So I spoke to him,  and he urged me to seek help.  So I told my boyfriend,  who I was desparately afraid to tell. This Monday,  I'm calling my doctor,  and I will be in the psych ward if things go okay money wise. I'm glad I tasked to my bff, and that my bf is going to talk with my dad.I love you Alex,  you are my brother. You are my best friend.  You are the reason I'm alive today,  just as I'm the reason you're alI've today. I'm afraid beyond my wildest dreams to go,  but I had to take an extra klonopin because I needed to be able to talk .I'm really unable to concentrate,  but I'm not suicidal as of right now.What are psych wards like.I'm pasing out now.  Goodnught."
I see no good future for myself.,"There is a lot more to it. But I'm stuck in a family that I can't escape. I'm getting older and older and running out of prospects for a chance at a good life. The only good possible outcome would be I die of a heart attack before I reach 40 but I doubt the universe would give me mercy like that. I want to end it before I become the very same monster my parents were. I'd rather die as I am now than have mental illness, hormone and health problems, and addiction turn me into the very thing that still gives me nightmares about my childhood. I'm already forced to financially rely on my brother who already has become that and there's no way out."
What to do,"I have struggles with suicidal thoughts for over half my life, and lately it has gotten so severe that I am scaring myself. I am 24 and have severe BPD, anxiety, and depression. I haven't left my house in over a month because my anxiety has gotten so out of control. Little back story, I have a fianc̩ who can't keep it in his pants, and cheated on me while I was out of state having a Medical procedure. Which caused me to have a full emotional shut down. I go from being completely numb to feeling everything and making a suicide plan, within minutes. I am unable to leave my home which caused me to lose my job and I have been alone a lot since I have been back in town after my procedure. The state I live in doesn't have insurance for non working 20 something's with mental health problems. I am trying to find a way to release without hurting myself and feel that I'm running out of options. My fianc̩ doesn't know what to do so he just ignores me. And if I try to find way to make myself a tiny bit better he tells me it's wrong. I just want to stop thinking about these horrible things! "
"I don't know who or what I am, I'm drowning in work and classes, and I just can't take it anymore. [Long]","I hate every last part of who I am, from my gender to my hair color and everything else. I hate the bloody, disgusting hole between my legs and wish I could fill it with cement. PIV is not pleasurable for me and stresses me out. Menstruation, pregnancy, and birth all sound horrible. Maybe I'd want a kid of my own one day, but I have no desire to carry that baby, and my male SO can't do it...I hate the balls of fat on my chest and wish I could cut them off and just have a flat chest like a guy. I have red hair that everyone is constantly commenting on. I don't like the attention. I've cut it very, very short (like a 5 with clippers) and wear a hat partially to hide it and keep it from drawing attention. I hate the apartment my SO and I are living in. He's asked me to vocalize what I hate about it specifically, but I'm honestly not even sure exactly what it is. But I honestly do. For the first few weeks, I couldn't stand being there at all, and hid under the bed to not have to see it while I cried about it. Eventually, I just kind of accepted it. I still hate it, but I don't constantly cry about that in particular.I'm currently attending a school I hate, doing a double major in 2 subjects I don't necessarily love. One's difficult and I took it on because my SO and a friend thought I'd be good at it. The other's a bullshit major; something to fall back on in case I fail out of the hard one. I used to be a perfect student, but last semester I failed a class for the first time and had to repeat it over the summer.I don't want to sound like I'm blaming anyone or like I'm playing the victim, but I'm going to end up sounding that way. A lot of my problems stem from an abusive mother (physically, verbally, emotionally) and my abusive ex (rapist). I haven't spoken to my mother in over a year, and sometimes I wish I had a real mother. I was with my ex for 2 years and raped hundreds of times during that span. He pinned me down and had me call him ""master"". I've been self-harmer since. But recently, I've gotten a lot more reckless with it. I used to cut on just one thigh, then moved to just one hip when I couldn't hide my thigh very well in the summer. Now, I'm cutting from my thighs to the top of my breasts, and everything in between, as well as my wrists.I've given up completely on making friends. I lost all my friends in high school thanks to the mess I became with my ex. I don't talk to people in class, and I don't go any more in depth than necessary with customers and random people who try to engage me. All my emotions seem muted. Anxiety has taken a backseat, and now I just try to force myself to go to class and do the bare minimum to keep up appearances that I'm a normal, functioning human being. I don't really feel anything at all, let alone love, for my family, and even my feelings for my SO seem muted or hard to access (I'm not totally sure how to explain it...).But I'm still a mess. And there's nothing i can do about it. I want to die. I can't handle 18 credits, 2 jobs, and relationships. I can't quit my first job because it's part of my financial aid (work study). I don't want to quit my second job because it's the only thing I enjoy even a little out of the main three (2 jobs and school). I can't drop out of school because I'd lose financial aid and screw up any future I still have a chance at. I don't even see a future right now. I cannot imagine myself alive next week, let alone in 5 years. I don't have the time or energy or desire for therapy. I don't need to waste hours of my week spilling my guts (something else I cannot do) and hearing someone tell me, ""Think positive! It gets better! Mindfulness!"". I can't tell anyone or talk to anyone other than my SO. The only other choice I can see for myself going forward is suicide. I attempted once before when I was with my ex and failed miserably because I didn't do any research. So. Yeah. Just a long rambling vent, I guess. I'm not even sure what I'm hoping to get out of it. "
It doesn't get better,"I always got told it gets better when I was younger and depressed and felt hopeless
And I knew that better doesn't just happen
So I gave up everything I had for a chance to have the life I needed as myself but I have just been used more and broken more and hurt more
I did everything I could to make things better
Always do my best
But mental illness has taken over and ruined everything I had left
I try so hard every day but it's always for nothing and I'm so tired
The only friend I have left that will speak to me any more still just says it'll get better even though they can't say how
I did everything I could to make it get better but now I am so much worse off absvhave nothing and almost no one
I just want the hurting to stop but I'm too scared
Everyone gas given up on me
I hust wanted to be happy "
F*k,"Oh dear, I hope everything is alright over there!"
I'm the stupidest and weakest person alive. I just want to end it all.,"I am finally living with the man I love. We got along great until a few weeks ago. Long story short, he has a woman ""best friend"" who he chats with frequently. He knows my feelings towards that friendship, as she was the reason he moved away a couple years ago.
He won't tell me anything about their friendship, just that she's a really good friend. They had a fight around the time he moved in with me, and he didn't speak with her for 7 months. Now they're speaking again, and he never tells me what they chat about. He won't even tell me what the fight was about, other than it was a misunderstanding.
We are going on a trip next week, and I have paid for about 90% of it, because I love him, and want him to experience some fun. He has depression and anxiety as well. He is not himself since he started on a new med, he doesn't even cuddle me anymore.
Today, we were grocery shopping, and whenever he texts this woman, he never says anything. He had a huge smile on his face, which I haven't seen in a long time. I asked if it was because he was excited about the trip, and he said he hasn't really been thinking about it.
I want to fucking kill myself so bad right now. This is the same pain I felt when he moved away. I do not want to go through this again. I can't go through this again!!!"
I�۪m done,I�۪m just tired of this life. I want out. I literally have no vision of what the future holds for me. I want to end this now but I�۪m too anxious as to what will happen to those around me if I end my life now.
I'm sitting on building waiting to jump,"I've been sitting here at the top of this 10 story building for 10 minutes.  I hate my life so much, and I have no one who cares about me.  Is there any reason I shouldn't just slide off and end it?"
"I'm so overwhelmed, I don't think I can be alive","I've been dealing with depression that's been ignored since I was a child. I've dealt with wanting to slit my throat for years. I have no one, I'm almost positive no one will ever love me, and certain circumstances strongly limit my choices in life and in the future. I don't feel like I can deal with this anymore. I feel trapped in a box so small I cant even move, it's excruciating. I've had so many close calls with suicide recently, I've had the knife up against my throat and I wanted to do it so badly. I don't know what to do anymore, I want to kill myself so much. "
"Everything is a burden, including myself","My life is going nowhere why shouldnt I just kill myself. I thought once I did something with ym OCD then it would be obvious. I dont know what to do now. I have NO goals and I dont know what to do now, I cant handle living on my own, I cant drive, I cant do anything. I seriously dont know what I am supposed to do other than end my life.I feel like everyone is trying to make fun of me and make me as uncomfortable and miserable as possible
I just dont see a point in trying to be with others if all they do is hate me
And someone will say I love you if anyone reads this but you dont actually, you barely know me. Im just an insignificant speck on the world, there is no way you know me, I could be faking it. In fact I am faking my personality
I have none of my own so I do this shit"
Please please please tell me why I shouldn't kill myselt,"Because you are worth it.You were worth everyone's time, every single moment someone even looked at you, was worth it.I don't know you, I don't think i ever will, but it's almost impossible for a person to see everyone on earth. But that shouldn't stop you from trying. A 1% change, even a 0.001% chance, is still worth trying."
I hate being alive.,"I have various tabs open at the moment for suicide... not that I am going to kill myself. I wouldn't do that; I couldn't do that.Just... sometimes I feel like it's the only option for me, to stop having to feel this way All. The. Fucking. Time. I am so tired of everything. Tired. T i r e d.I know other people have it worse than me, believe me, I do. But you have to appreciate that I have been unhappy and lonely my entire life; I've reached the point where I'm just done about with it. It's not like I've befallen some terrible tragedy and this is the climax of my story, the point where I look starry-eyed at the sunset, make a heartfelt decision, and eventually overcome this great adversity and ultimately grow as a person. No, that bullshit only exists in movies because, in truth, life constantly corrodes away you. My soul feels as though it is envoloped by this black poison, worn down and cracked to the point where this horrible ink just seeps out over anything I touch.Nothing good in my life lasts; it doesn't take long before the good becomes contaminated. I can't enjoy my successes, because the poison warps them into failures. I can't have functional relationships, because the poison reminds me that nobody could ever like the real me. I can't even get help, because the poison constantly makes me feel like I don't deserve it.Something as toxic as myself should just rot."
Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should just commit suicide,"I'm not really planning on it, but sometimes I find myself thinking that it would be a relief so often, that I don't know why my mind is still averse to the thought of actually doing it. I mean I still have a few basic reasons not to, like the fact that it would hurt some people, and I genuinely worry that if I commit suicide it might trigger one or two more, and I always want to imagine that I'll figure things out someday.But the thought of dying sounds so relieving. I never feel relief in my life. Relief is super rare but I still keep doing things and pushing forward and I feel like this lack of relief will always keep me too demotivated to make positive changes. So why not just end it?Sometimes though, I wish someone in my personal life would hear my problems and instead of getting uncomfortable or having some typical reaction, would actually be concerned and just give me an understanding ear."
I don't want to live anymore with such never ending pain,"My whole family is full of evil and wicked people . I was always in depression since my childhood due the disease h pylori my parents gave me by birth and also due to their abusive and extremely selfish behaviour . My condition got worst with my growing age due lot of stress and bad diet .I can't work due to my illness , this h pylori has given me some other diseases also like IBS, PCOD and hyperemia.

I feel like there is no god only a satan running this world just don't know what to do can't even commit suicide due to my dog who only gets love from me for else he doesn't even exist and if i die they will throw him out of their house. Pls help"
Don't want my roommates to have to deal with me,"The only thing really stopping me from killing myself is that I don't want my roommates to have to find me and deal with it. This doesn't really have to do with anything I just feel really guilty for wanting to die but as a result leaving behind trauma for my roommates to deal with, I just wanted to tell someone."
"Life is awful right now, and im worried about myself","I've been in an awful state of mind. I hate to say it, but my father took his life recently, and i dont know how to deal with it. I've suffered from depression and sparse suicidal thoughts here and there, but this is ""icing on the proverbial cake"". I dont know what to do. I need to be here for my mother and younger siblings. I need help."
Lost the wrong thing,I've been a kissless virgin for 23 years and very recently managed to break the kissless part thanks to being wasted enough to make a move. Tonight I managed to go home with a girl but lo and behold I couldn't get it up. We gave up and I went home.I'm kinda just feeling nothing right now. I've thought about suicide a lot before and attempted one in a half ass kind of way. I'm just done.
Just don't feel like being alive anymore.,"I'm not sad or angry, really. For the past few years, I've honestly had probably the best life I can imagine. I haven't been insanely wealthy, but I've managed to make enough money with minimal work to be able to do whatever I've wanted. I've been able to sleep/stay up as late as I want with no repercussions, I've done a fair amount of traveling, and had an above average love life. I've seen amazing sights, eaten at top-caliber restaurants, and had virtually zero stress.Now, it seems, that's coming to an end. The steady flow of money has pretty much stopped, and it's likely that if I'm to continue my life, I'll have to go back to working a regular day job, being burdened with debt, etc. Honestly, I really just don't feel like doing it again. I've tasted the freedom of living a life that gives me whatever I want whenever I want it, and I have absolutely zero desire to go back to living paycheck to paycheck, following someone else's schedule, giving up all of my freedom except that which exists between when I get off of work and when I go to sleep.So that's it. Am I wrong for feeling that way? I feel like I could die today and I would be satisfied to have gotten to live the last few years the way that I have. If I go on, it's unlikely I'll be able to live that way again for another 30-40 years, and then I'll be too old to enjoy it the same way that I have. Just seems kind of pointless to restart, grinding away at a future that has virtually no chance of being as pleasant as my past. Why put in the effort?"
I think I'm going to try it tomorrow,"Background: this isn't my first rodeo. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and 14 years later they're coming up again, louder than ever.When I heard about Chester Bennington and his history of abuse I learned that we were victimized at the same ages. His music was life support when I was young, and I can't shake the idea that this is just what happens when your life was too hard to deal with as a kid. I have 3 degrees in psychology but still can't get this to stop. And really that's all I want at this point, not to be stuck in this body and mind anymore.I lost my job due to depression, lost my partner for similar reasons, survived a car crash but it fucked with my brain, and that's just the past 2 years. I haven't been able to pick myself up and find a life worth living. Instead I keep treading water. No matter how many job apps I put out or plans I make for the future, it doesn't pan out. It feels like the end of the road, and all I want is an end to the suffering.Tomorrow I'm going to a show to see one of my favorite bands. I've been using this show as a reason to hang on for the past couple months -  it's silly, but it's been working. But when it's over, there's not a whole lot else to keep me here and I figure if I'm still unhappy at the end of the night then what the hell is the point of holding on.If it comes to that tomorrow night, I'm going to try hanging myself with a bedsheet slip knotted to the doorknob, thrown over top and slip knotted again around the neck. I've gotten into the set-up before just to see if it would hold and it does. I worry about my cat since it's just me and her and I don't want to cause her pain not having her owner around (she's very attached). But in the end it's either going to be her or me who goes first...it's inevitable. I don't know why I'm telling you any of this. I'm just so alone and it would be good to feel heard, I guess."
so i don't know what to do...,"so late last night someone broke into my home, stole $2500 worth of shit and raped my mother and sisters (13 and 15)
 while i was tied up and forced to watch _��� im so scared i haven't stopped crying
PLEASE HELP!"
I feel like every bit of temporary happiness I feel is worse punishment than the pain I'm in,Nothing ever sticks around. People leave me or ignore me or pretend they don't care. Whenever I feel one good thing it immediately gets even worse right afterward. This is torture. I dont care if I kill myself because I'm already in hell
"I don't know when I might kill myself, but I'm tired of being alone","Having perspective, my life could be so much worse I get it. I have a roof over my head, I have some money to feed myself, I've had some good times in the past. Yet, this isn't enough I realise. Selfish right. I have come to horrible realisation that I really do hate who I am. I used to like myself. I used to like how small and quirky I thought I was, how I liked culture, how people liked me. Now I realise people only like the surface of me, meeting me briefly is a pleasant account. I'm polite and nice but really, I have nothing to say when it comes to longer convos. I went to uni for a bit, put myself out there to meet loads of people but now I hardly keep in contact with anyone. I took a year out and this summer has been hard because almost everyone I know has had a good time with friends and family, even strangers that pop up on my facebook are having a better time than me. I now have had to delay going to uni due to how depressed I am. All I have been doing is sitting in bed depressed. I try to leave the house and do things but I do thing alone most of the time. Another thing is, I don't have a close family. I hardly speak to my mum. She feeds me and gives me money but we don't have any connection and I never really knew my dad, I don't have any close relatives who I speak to, I'm not ethnically English so I stand out from that, I look younger for my age, I've not been in a relationship, I was in care for many years but I don't keep in contact with the foster carers (long story) I knew, I have no basis. I went to a posh uni but came from poor background/area and grew apart from most people I went to school with. Having no constant socialising, I get lonely. I thought about trying to go out and meet new people but realise I'm not interesting enough. Even having a family you get on makes you more interesting. Even having friends you frequently do stuff with or chat you makes you more interesting. I don't have those things. I thought about reaching out to people I do know but most of them have their own lives and haven't really replied to me when I have started convo or tried to arrange to hang out. I am currently lounging at a friends house for free, his mum has been so nice and good to me but I now just feel guilty and if I do kill myself, it's going to hurt her as well as my friend. His mum doesn't even know me that well, I've just rocked up and she's taken me in. If it was a case of 'oh I need somewhere to stay' then fair, I wouldn't feel too too bad but its the fact that I am also so depressed you know...
I have other carers but they don't always contact or message me. They help me when I need it but can go ages without talking to me. Again, did I do something wrong to make them not give that unconditional love I feel like I deserve?
My friend works loads now so I don't see him which is good because I don't want to burden him with what I'm going through entirely (don't want to explain this one, I have my reasons). I need to get a job so I can start paying my friend's mum back. I'm in a new city and don't know anyone really. I don't think I'm really really strange or anything. I just think everyone has been way luckier than me in life. life has a funny way of making you feel guilty to be safe and lucky but will throw shit at you all the time until you can't cope. I'm a nice person. Before being where I am now, I was at uni and met few people who liked me. But they've all drifted from me and I also lived with people who weren't nice to me and I had nothing in common with. I think a lot of life is luck. I put myself out there but I got nothing back. I think maybe it's also due to where I came from and who I am personality wise that I can't hold down strong friendships. My facebook is full of people reminiscing funny shit they did with each other or photos with each other sayin how much they all love each other. All I long for is connection and unconditional love from some people. I want to discuss funny times, have good memories with people, share good things, invest time to grow and have hobbies, can go for drinks with people without feeling so empty. And when I do meet people, I've been stuck in my depression bubble for so long that I have nothing to say to people. I don't care about my hobbies anymore.
I am useless. I'm 21 living in the UK. There's no hope anymore, no help. Don't worry, I've tried to get help but it will stay like this as long as I am living this shitty life. Maybe some people were meant to not live..."
i don't know what to do,"idk whats wrong with me, i feel nothing, i cant cry, i don't feel sad, i am completely Numb, sometimes am afraid that i won't even be able to care or being sad if i lose someone important to me, it's been like this for years but this year it's worse, i failed my exams last semester i didn't even study for them, on some of them i didn't even go to the examination room, and i don't feel sad or even worried.my parents they love me soo much, i didn't tell them that i failed, i dnt want to disappoint them, the only think that keeps me from not committing suicide it's because of my family i dnt want them to be sad.i had friends i just dnt talk to them anymore, i stay in my room 24/7, i just don't get out of it, i dont live with my parents, so they don't know about all these stuffs. i don't even know how i don't get sick literally i just eat 3/2 cookies per day, i only eat decent meal 1 a week, the rest of the week is just cookie/biscuit and tea i've been living like this for 3monthsi really don't know what to do, because i failed my exams, i didn't go to school to see what i hav to do, if failed the whole semester or no, i don't know.  i just stay in my room and watch anime or movies etc,i just wish i had the power to make everyone forget about me so i could just die without grief.
the scariest part is the clock is ticking i can't stay like this, i have pretty much 1month to decide what to do, because the school might kick me out, i can't stay here because am not studying. tbh my life has been a mess since 2013, i am one of the unluckiest person in the world."
I almost attempted again.,I thought I was getting better but I guess not. Had my noose ready and my head in yet I didn't do it. I wish I had the courage to.
Fear of hell?,I really really really wanna kill myself but I know that if I kill myself I will go to hell. Man it's the worst form of trap. But I am going to hell anyways so why not just make it faster? is hell worse than this? Man I wish I wasn't born religious would've been dead years ago.
How long am I supposed to believe it gets better?,"This is an expanded repost of something I posted in the dead of night yesterday that I'm pretty sure no one read. I'm 22. My life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew. I can't remember most of my childhood because I was raped my a priest when I was in fourth grade. I can't really remember much of anything about my life. Even shit that happened fairly recently. I can't maintain normal relationships. First one ended in me being stalked for five years. Second one was just me being used. Third/fourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth (no, it hasn't come back a year and a half later), and seriously contemplating death. This is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety. And then I got kicked out on short notice.Fifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together. After two months of not talking I started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing. I kind of hate myself for it, but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because it's really hard for me to meet and approach new people. My only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority. These people also think I'm a fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me. I don't really blame them.I got bullied a lot k-12. I understand why. I'm generally strange and aggravating to be around. I've worked on it a lot, so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours. After high school I took a gap year in Germany. That was a mistake. I was pretty lonely and just drank a lot. And then I started blacking out (turns out PTSD from being raped as a child can cause that), and my family basically told me I was on my own and that they didn't want to deal with me coming back at the moment (at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought I was having seizures).College sucked. I chose poorly and wasn't ready. I did a year. I'm still on leave. I know I'll never be able to afford to go back. I'm not sure that I want to. Up until Thursday I didn't think I would have to. Because this summer, after all of the bullshit, the shit jobs, the loneliness, and everything else, I managed to actually get the job I really wanted. And then I went and somehow found a way to fuck it up. Actually no, that's a lie. I know exactly how I fucked it up. By being myself.I'm not sure what's left at this point. My entire life has been about making it to the next place because that won't suck, right? Only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard I try. I don't have dreams for the future anymore. When people ask me where I seem myself in ten years I'm completely lost because I can't imagine even being alive in ten years. It's not that I plan on being dead, it's that I don't see how I'm going to make it. I'm just tired. I want to stop. I've been pushing for what feels like my entire life now, and I just want a break. My earliest memories are of someone stomping on my fingers on the playground while I'm trying to draw something on a piece of paper. I don't want this anymore. I have plans to keep going. I've already sent out a bunch of job applications, and am getting my documentation together for something else that may workout for me. It just hard to even draw up the energy to keep going. I feel like I'm never going to be able to sit back and relax for more than a week and enjoy the feeling that life is actually pretty okay. Because every time I finally start to get that feeling every comes crashing down like a house of cards made out of bricks.I've really tried to improve myself and unfuck my life. And to a certain extent I've succeeded. It's just not enough. I'm not sure it will ever be enough."
Struggling more and more each day...,"I've posted about how I am about to get a divorce. Long story short, I feel as if I did everything I could to be a good husband, mainly in terms of being there for her in sickness and in health. She has endometriosis and ever since we began dating, she's been dealing with related issues and I've been there for her always. Countless trips to the ER/hospital and many doctors appointments. She had major surgery on the other side of the state two years ago and I took 3 weeks off to care for her as she recoverd.She has almost always been too sick, sore, tired, or nauseous to want to do much and we haven't had much of a social life and more or less no sex life either. After the surgery, she got off a lot of her usual meds, they only caused more trouble with the side effects, and got approved for medicinal marijuana. We discussed this beforehand and I was fine with it. The pot and a new diet helped her lose nearly 50 pounds and her self esteem grew.At this point, I admit that her health problems were taking a toll on me. I felt taken for granted and unappreciated. I also was starting to struggle with depression and anxiety. My temper worsened and it drove a bigger wedge between my wife and I. She begged me to begin seeing a therapist and/or getting on antidepressants. I've done both. I realized that the marriage was at risk once my wife began hanging out with new friends and spending less time with me. Once she brought up the idea of having an open marriage, I should have realized it was over.Despite the fact that I had kept asking her if we were done, she continued to protest the idea of divorce. However, her new lifestyle centered on going out with friends, getting high, and spending a lot of time with other men. We stopped sharing a bed and more or less stopped talking. I was and still am convinced she has been cheating on me, but she still denies it. Even if she wasn't sleeping with anyone else, she still made the choice to spend her time with others, to share her thoughts and feelings with them and cut me out of her emotional mindset.She finally told me she wanted a divorce the day before her birthday, nearly a month before our 5th anniversary. I've since moved back in with my dad. She no longer will even talk to me so I can get ahold of the necessary papers so I can take responsibility for my personal debts. She's keeping the furniture and staying in the rental property we lived in, as it is owned by her uncle. She has taken my entire life from me, I have nothing, she has everything, and now she is becoming such a bitch to me that I absolutely hate her. The last 7 years of my life have been for nothing.Now I am stuck at my dad's with no internet, poor cable, and nothing of my own. I have no friends or any social life. My confidence is shot and I have so much anxiety even talking to strangers that I'm unable to work up the nerve to go out and try to make friends. I've never been good at making relationships that last. I've never had a best friend, aside from my wife. I'm lonely and bored and frustrated. I have no privacy at home, so I can't even jerk off to alleviate that frustration.Before I moved out, my wife confessed she is pansexual and polyamorous. That's fine and dandy, but she could have saved me so much heartache if she had come to that conclusion about who she truly is, before we even got engaged. I no longer feel like I can even trust another woman. From what I've seen on the couple of dating apps I've checked out, there appears to be a lot of poly/pan women out there. I am open-minded, but I am just not that ""progressive"" I guess. I'm almost 39 and many the women my age already have kids and most of them are educated and have actual careers. I work in a factory and have nothing.Getting into another relationship is not the answer for me, but I can't even get a simple hook-up if I wanted. I don't know how to talk to people and I nearly panic every time I'm in crowed places. Simply put, I feel completely inept and useless. I am miserable and unable to see anything improving. I feel, at this point, that the most productive thing I could do with my life is end it.I'm extremely pessimistic and increasingly misanthropic. I have yet to find a public space where I feel comfortable and welcome. I just sit in the library or in the corner of a bookstore just so I can have access to free WiFi and even then I find nothing of interest. I'm lost and drowning. I just lack the courage to take the steps to kill myself.I'm miserable, angry, tired, bored, lonely, and listless. Nothing seems to help. Everything is just a distraction. I really don't know what to think and I doubt anything or anyone can really help."
I'm feeling suicidal.,I hate my life so much.
Can somebody just kill me please,What's making you feel this way? YOu told anyone what you're going through or looked into getting help?
Having second thoughts,"So, i just lot a few shipments of things that i earn my life with.
Yesterday i ordered some heroine to od because i literally have no money, no education, skills, family or anything. But today im not so sure, i don't really want to die but just to vanish. Im also really lazy to die or do anything i dont really know what to write"
Just need a place to let some of it out.,"I've been in queue to chat for over an hour at National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. I'm afraid to call after reading their privacy policy and that they can and will call the police at their discretion.Basically I just feel done with life. I messed up too badly and permanently too many times to fix it. I am full of regret and self-loathing and I can't stand it but though I have the means to do it, I won't. Just because of my family members I believe love me and my two dogs. My husband is away for work for a few months and there wouldn't be anyone to take care of them if I do it. Plus no one would love them like I do. I thought having more to do would give me that sense of purpose instead of all this despair. But I can't do the things I want to most (ruined those opportunities via life decisions that cannot be unmade) so instead I....started grad school. While working full time. In a program I chose ONLY because I could get tuition reimbursement from work. So now my days are absolutely filled and all I want to do every second of every day is go to sleep and never wake up.I guess I don't really have a point, I just wanted to talk and think someone was listening."
I'm either crazy or being haunted but it doesn't matter because i'm alone and miserable. Can someone please speak to me.,Ive gone years without talking to anyone alive. Someone please contact me soon
My 'friends' are horrible people,"I have a group of friends and when one is away, all they do is talk crap about them. I don't, but I bet they talk crap about me, I am the fattest and ugliest of the group."
i need a friend now more than ever,hi friend
I can't take this anymore...,"My mom has been in and out of the hospital for the past 6 years - tonight she just left for the ER and if she's admitted, that would be her 476th visit in the last 6 years. I'm only in high school, taking all AP classes, with friends who treat me like shit. Honestly, they don't care about me in the slightest bit, all they do is shit on me for trying to make the pain better by taking my prescribed painkillers for a recent surgery I had - calling me an addict when I'm not. I'm gay, and they take advantage of that by making awful jokes towards me about it and that they'll ""get me some dick"". They know about the situation with my mom, yet don't help me when I need them the most. I can't take this any longer - I feel trapped in my suffering life and I just want to end it. I have nightmares every night that all follow the same story: my mom dies in the hospital, my dad goes into a bout of depression and kills himself because he can't live without my mom, and then my 8-year-old brother and I end up in foster care. I can't do this, I just can't live to see the day that it all happens. I take a SSRI yet I still feel like my life is going nowhere but into a ditch where I'm going to just suffer eternally.Please help"
"I've Had A Death Wish For A While Now, And It's Just Gotten Worse.","I actually don't know why I'm telling anyone about this. Ever since my first depression scare back in seventh grade, I've always thought I was getting better. The feelings kinda faded out, and I generally internalised any desire to kill myself. I think that's because my mother started calling it emotional blackmail after about 3 months. She tends to put me down a lot. The thing is, no matter how much we argue, no matter how little self-worth she makes me feel, I still love her, and she loves me. My death wish was just general, hoping for a truck to hit me, or a random heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. I wouldn't want to kill my self at all, I had a lot of hope, but I wouldn't have minded dying. I always lied on those depression questionnaires at the doctor's office, I had a feeling my mother would yell at me. But recently my life hasn't been going so perfectly. In certain areas, I'm fuckin golden, life is great, I'm actually on track for debate team leadership and I'm enjoying school somehow. But everywhere else just hurts. I've gotten worse at swimming after taking a month off, my grades are slipping in a few classes thanks to teachers who give about three assignments a month, and on good days I talk to people outside of my family circle. On bad day's I just get reprimanded for not being a top performer, and not being like the rest of the Indian community. I hold my fingers up to my head and pretend it's a gun a lot. Try to fantasize about what it would feel like. I do it a lot around my mom. I just pretend I'm scratching an itch, she hasn't really commented on it. Frankly, I have conversations with myself inside my head when I'm swimming, or when I'm lonely; it tends to make me feel a bit better. Other times it makes me feel worse. I don't do anything to get more friends, or even to keep them, just because I fucked up back in seventh grade making me worry that doing anything would make it worse. Yesterday, I wanted to skip swimming, and then my mom told me that some friends of mine were ditching to go for a football game. She offered to take me, but I decided to go to swimming instead, mainly because that wouldn't involve as much interacting with people. I wanted to become a comedian, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I also wanted to be a neurologist or neurosurgeon, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I've actually thought of how WWIII would give me a chance to enlist and die fighting, making me a little bit more useful. Then I realised I'm clearly insane to even imagine that. I don't know how to end this. The post or my life, it's not like I have a gun or anything. I've heard that bleach often fails, and I don't want to risk that. So basically, my only effective method is jumping off the roof of my school or some other tall-ish building. God fucking dammit, I hate myself."
i feel like i cant breathe,"All I every do is worry about money. I worry and worry about payments and rent and I feel like I'll never have enough money. I don't know how to stop. I can't keep feeling like this, it's killing me"
Been feeling EMPTY inside for 10+ years and Depressed,"Well, i want to start out with brief about what all happened to me and i kinda feel like shit ever since 2008. When a triple-tragedy struck me. I have never spoken about any of this to anyone, let alone the internet. this is my deep feelings and thoughts who i wanted to share with someone who can come up with answersbefore 2008, I was a really happy, crazy and adventurous person. And i studied in england from 1999 to 2005. After that period i came back to my home country and met an amazing women in 2006 and we instantly fell over each other. Everything was going great between me, her and everything was exception in my life, like my business, my adventures and excursions and everything i could ever ask for. I smoked, drank, partied and above all, went to long nature trips in mountains and hills. I don't know how it started but my women & me started having a few problems over getting married. She was insisting on quick marriage, and i wanted more time thinking we were still young and everything fell apart and fights happened. Then i found out few weeks later that she was sleeping with someone else and i legit felt suicidal and even tried to twice. ( this was 2007-late) i kept crying man-tears for 6 months, had panic and anxiety attacks at night and i was literally losing 5-10 KG weight between that period.And then in 2008-mid, triple tragedy struck. First my girl, outright confessed to me, that she was with someone else and dumped me, and married someone else abroad and met me one last time before going out to another country saying me final goodbye. a few days later, my dad died under mysterious circumstances, with some saying he committed suicide and some thinking he had brain hemorrhage. A couple of days, after he passed away. the Banks came over to my company, took over all the assets and sold it to another company and gave me literally peanuts. And it was all hell which broke loose during that month. I had been reduced from living like a king to a roadside homeless beggar. almost overnight. Within 6 months, i started my new company from scratch paid off my father's pending loans, creditors and taxmen (which would continue to be paid off even 5 years later). I ultimately got married and have a son now. and after that i came to know that my mother had a secret affair with one of the worst humans i know even during the time when my father was alive. I confronted her and she didnt give me a straight answer. Few months later, she took all the money, property papers etc and fled to this monster of a man. I confronted her again and ultimately she wanted me & my wife/son out of the house. Eventually we had to move out and i was thrown out of her inheritance and strangely my sisters also accepted my mother's decision and stayed with her and sided with her. they took almost 90% of my money (which i foolishy gave them and trusted them)Ever Since then, my life has been close to hell. My wife thinks she had bad luck that she got married to me and face all these problems which other women don't and it had made her infuriated against me even for a small issue, to which i cant say a word anymore. i couldn't and cannot fully concentrate on my work, even though work is going OKish. I am surrounded 24/7 by nostalgia of how my life had been and how it just slipped right out of my hands despite my best fucking efforts. I used to be so driven and willing to take risks. But now im a shadow of my own self, withering in pain silently, not able to say anything back to anyone and just accepting how things are. I work silently and still give in my best thought and best efforts. Literally almost all family connection i had is now a faded memory, the person i loved a most and who loved me the most was my dad. Everyone else is estranged now. Anyone else in my position at any given point between these last 10 years, would outright commit suicide. But i have stood upright and taken in all wrong and right criticism thrown at me and i have literally taken everything on the chin. I think its wrong that i am alive and i feel EMPTY inside. No emotions, just a long dull pain. What i have gone through, i cannot even imagine anyone else being in that position and living through it. I literally was a millionaire and then became peniless , millionaire again and now again just passing through time. Even though i dont have money problems even now. Everything else just feels COLD. Emotionless, like a gulp in the wind. I literally had a heartbreak with my own life, which i loved so much and now whatever i try, i'm just clutching at straws. I even tried smoking weed once or twice a month and i must say, it gives me a clear vision for that month and makes me bit more calm. Every single thing is telling me to end this life and i still foolishly carry on..... I don't know why im built like rock to withstand all the bullshit i have had to face so far. Please tell me what to do......."
Planning to end it all by the school year if I mess up.,"Starting to plan to end my life, if I mess up in my English Class. I already have an F and tried to find ways to relieve my stress. If it doesn't go as planned, then I need to end my life. I hate my English teacher he's crap, and expects me to complete 4 pages of notes in a few days. This is the best way I could force myself, no college if I mess up. An F is bad for my Junior year."
I'm done. I'm a worthless piece of shit. I don't want anyone dealing with my body when I die. What can I do?,"(Apologies for this formidably long read. The rules state that I shouldn't ask for suggestion.I just want tell my story ,put it out here what I've been feeling for years.)I would like to clarify at the outset that  I'm not writing this  out of impulse now. I've been planning my suicide for more than  a year now.I'm 23 now, since I was 11/12 I've always felt I'm a misfit. I've always felt that I'm floating inside my body, I've no purpose in this world. I'm a loser, an evil incarnate, I can never be normal. I realized all this when I was 14/15.Throughout my school and college years ,I've been faking everything-smile,friendship,happiness,etc., Others don't know the face underneath the mask I put on. I've had it enough, I couldn't do the same at work,one day I just came to home without informing anyone at work.And when they tried to contact me ,I avoided itI was terminated. I lied to my friends that I got job in another city.For the past 18 months,I have been lying to them,while planning my suicide. I got hold of sleeping pills.I just want to end it and cause minimal harm to my family. I don't want them to find my body because this is just traumatic , hell it would be great if they didn't even know I was dead and just went missing.I always imagined I would get to a place like those deserts in Breaking bad  TV series and commit suicide. sometime I wish  someone would just kill me and dump in a place like that.alas, I live in third world country, I don't know if there are any such places here. I'm saying all this so that you  would understand where I am coming from and the  suicidal thoughts I have been having since childhood feeling  like a waste of space.So PLEASE don't try to convince me not to, I've heard it all before and it wont help. hell its probably just like what it was like before I was born - nothing - and compared to the pathetic life I live that sounds great to me.please help me.PM me your ideas.Help this world by getting ridding of me. "
I don't want to die but I see no way to get better,"People always say you're supposed to ask for help when you're suicidal and that it'll get better but I've been asking for help for 7 years and now no one knows how to help any more and it's still not better. I've been through mental health services, inpatient and outpatient, therapy, tried a bunch of meds and the only thing that helped was the meds I'm taking now but since I'm struggling now the doctors are saying that I should change my meds to another antipsychotic with horrible side effects and to an SSRI which have never helped before. I'm honestly scared I won't survive a med change, I think my current meds are the only thing keeping me alive. I don't want to go back to the way I was before them, very suicidal, delusional, depressed, self harming and in and out of the police cells and inpatient all the time because of it.I don't know what else I'm meant to do though, my mental health is deteriorating again and I'm feeling very stuck in my current life, being 24, single with no family or best friend, a shitty fast food job where I probably more money than doing what my qualification is in if I could get a job in it, no car and not much money saved because I haven't been able to hold down a job before these past 2 years. "
Its over,"I was not normal, i am not normal and i will never be normalI have no passion , nothing
No interests,
no Hobbys I  am already dead inside , time to kill myselfBye"
Feels like its all been building up to this,"When I was about 9 years old I had a close friend who would beg me to come over her home.  My mother, at the time, was addicted to cocaine and never present.  Our fridge and cabinets were bare, and I had already stolen (and had been caught) from the local C-town. So I agreed to go to her home for the night, hoping to get dinner. For the next two years I was raped by her grandfather. As was she, alongside me, and her younger sister Jeanine.  He would make us do things to each other, and told me every time ""you know if you tell anyone, I'll have to hurt them"".  He always assured me he was old, and taking his own life would be easy. He would bring out his gun and show it to me, sometimes making me hold it. When I was 13 he passed away, and the next year Jeanine hung herself. This has been living inside of me all these years. The past 7 years I've lived with a man who I fell head over heels for.  He was perfect, funny, smart and knew about my past.  To him, in the beginning, I wasn't flawed or tainted.  One night, during an argument, he shoved me against a wall.  I was scared, and began crying.  He held me and told me ""i will never ever hit you. I'm so sorry. I will never be the man my father was.""  The first punch came only a few months later. I found myself so obsessed with the fact that he loved me despite my past, that I didn't leave.  Over the next years he forbid me from seeing my friends, my family, and the beatings got worse.  But something inside of me wouldn't let me leave. What if I never found someone that accepted me again, and what if it was really just me making him act like this.  He'd tell me he never treated any other woman like this, and it was my fault for being a virus.  He wants a regular woman, someone who didn't have an ""old mans dick"" inside of me. That ""women like me"" ask to get raped.  Once I  begin to cry, it gets worse, and everything around me goes to black.  And then its just me, and the past, playing again and again...over and over...as the man I love laughs at me. In 2013 my sister committed suicide. One of our last conversations was her crying, asking me why she wasn't enough for me to realize I had to get out of this relationship. Begging me to come live with her, and that she lived in agony knowing of my situation.  I've always blamed myself.  In 2015, during the same month my sister had passed, my best friend died of an opiate overdose, and I was the last person he texted- asking me to come visit him (he lived 12 blocks away). But I was with my boyfriend, and he wouldn't allow me to go out.  The next day he was found dead. I have never forgiven myself.Now we both live in NYC, and all my friends and family have long abandoned me for not leaving him.  He recently told me I need to leave the house in two weeks, because he needs to have sex with other women.  I have no family, or friends to turn to. Shelters are full, and the street terrifies me.  I've been attempting suicide for as long as I can remember, before the rape. Back when my mother became abusive and chose her drug over me. I feel like it's all building up to this. I drink every day, more than anyone I've ever met.  I've never been more afraid of people, and my day to day has gotten so foggy.  Happiness is something I can't remember, I spend my days in a studio apartment, my body is covered in self harm scars that will never fade.  I hear this mans voice in my head whenever i See myself in a mirror, whenever I make a mistake. It never goes away. I am not at peace, and I feel like there is only one way out now.  The damage is within me, and eating me alive, and I just want to be free. If my sister could do it, so can I. He tells me all the time I'm being selfish by staying alive, because I couldve saved them. And I bring nothing but burden to everyone I meet. I know this is why my mother disowned me, and why my father ignored my calls.  I work in a field that involved me being around a lot of different types of medicine, and I've been researching. I think I found a good cocktail.  I haven't been as happy as I was when I found out the medicine was available to me in a long, long time.  I've made so many bad choices, and took so m any lives for granted.  What if you can start again? And even if not, even if its all a vast nothingness, it would be so much better than this life.  I hope for the courage and strength to finally do what needs to be done, and be at peace."
My friend's dad told her to kill herself,"So my girlfriend's friend texted her about 30 minutes ago about how her parents just beat the shit out of her and kicked her out so I went to go pick her up to bring her back to my girlfriend's house. At the moment, we're at my girlfriend's house and her friend is talking to us about what's happened throughout the day. Her dad basically said ""if you're thinking about killing yourself just do it already."", and he also hit her a couple of times after forcing himself into her room while she's changing (she's here without any undergarments, just a loose cloth dress), and they kick her out. She tells us that he was basically trying to guilt her into not killing herself, ""it's crazy that you would want to kill yourself after I didn't kill you in the womb."" Sorry if this is all over the place i'm just trying to relay the severity of the situation and I really want some help about how to help her with this situation. She can't stay at my girlfriend's house because at the moment she has nothing but the dress she has on and her phone, and her parents expect her home by 5 today (about 30 minutes from now) for dinner at their friends' house. Any help is appreciated."
"The ""I want out"" feeling is getting unbearable","I started a new full time job on Monday (9-5 in an office); 3 nights out of 5 I've ended up crying myself to sleep thinking about how miserable I am vs how happy I was only a couple of years ago. 1 thing changed and just like that I've been depressed for 2 years and my introverted/shyness turned into full blown social anxiety. I've distanced myself from all my friends, so much so that they basically forgot I exist.. I've failed at being a good son to my parents by being a complete mess for the past 2 years.. I don't take care of my diet or even bother with the gym anymore.. I just don't care.I don't see myself changing for the better any time soon and I can't take it anymore. The only thing that has helped me so far is medical marijuana at night but even that is temporary and not a true solution. My work is under a 10 month contract and once it's up I seriously don't know what I'm going to do. I'll be 26 and to be honest right now I don't see myself going past 30. The only thing that could hold me back is my parents.. not because I like them too much to take my life, but because I know that they genuinely love me and that it would ruin theirs."
Depressed,"For the last couple of years I have been struggling with depression because of loneliness. I just need someone I can talk to, someone I don't know before I do something I shouldnt do."
I'd rather die than fail,"I'm 21. Been struggling with depression since 13. Had suicidal thoughts nearly every day since then and I'm finally realizing I don't have a reason not to do it. Sure it will cause a lot of pain to those who love me but I can't keep living. I never feel good enough and I feel like a huge burden to those around me. I can imagine my life is what hell is like. Every time I gain a pound, spend a dollar, have a fight with my gf, or struggle with something professionally or academically it feels like it's the end of the world and I feel either fat, broke, I feel like my gf hates me or I feel stupid. I'm done. And I can't wait until the pain ends one way or the other."
A good friend of mine (m) broke up with one of my closest friends (f). He's talking about suicide and I don't know how to help.,Their breakup came as a surprise to everyone. Apparently she broke up with him. I don't think specifics matter that much here but then again I've never been in this situation before. How can I help?
"19, in college, no friends, no plans for the future, no reason to live.","I want to believe that things get better, but I haven't seen anything to prove that. So im probably gonna end it soon, I can't see any reason to not."
"If I made people who cared for me hate me, why shouldn't I kill myself??","I had several really good friends that I was close with. When I started to become depressed, they were really supportive and caring to me and prayed for me. But I had become a toxic mood-killer that unintentionally guilt-tripped and hurt those friends and they eventually left me. One made a  about how it was an accomplishment to get rid of me, and another one told me . At this point, it just  to me to commit suicide. Why should anyone who hurt and drove away caring and loving people keep on living? What value is there in that kind of life? I've went to college and made lots of cool friends, but it doesn't change the fact that I hurt my past friends and made them leave me, so it just makes sense to die."
"Being all over the place, wanting it to stop","I have bipolar disorder and have been hypomanic for the last few days. I don't have insurance, so I can't afford medication or a doctor's visit. I can't seem to calm myself down. My mind is racing, I can't focus on anything. I hate this feeling and being stuck with this disorder. It's not helping my suicidal ideation. I feel completely out of control. "
I literally have no one...,"I've had really bad depression along with suicidal ideation since I was around 10 years old. Im 19 now. It's just getting unbearable. I have no one in my life I can come to for anything, I literally work, go home to my apartment and sleep until I have to work again. It's my own fault, I have Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum which basically makes me socially inept. Like, I can talk to people at work if it's necessary otherwise I don't talk unless someone speaks to me first. I guess I'm just stubborn but it's just extremely hard for me to open up, I just don't see the point in conversing with people when I don't matter to them at the end of the day. So I basically dug myself in a hole because I refuse to open up to anyone, and left myself with nothing. I just  don't see myself in this world much longer. I really feel like I'm incapable of living. I've been through so much fucked up shit all my life  and I just really don't want to do this shit anymore. I don't even know how to explain everything, there's so much more too it than that but I just don't even know what to say. Everythings just so pointless though, there's no reason for me to be here. Only reason I'm still here is because I haven't found a reliable suicide method, as soon as I do though I won't hesitate to kill myself. "
What can I do about hopelessness?,"I think my biggest problem is that I can't find a single thing to be hopeful about. The experience I have of life is that I will never have anything I care about or work for. I will fail and lose out on everything. All I ever wanted was to be cared about. No one cares. I need help, but no one listens. Life is impossible without hope, but there's no reason for me to hope. Hope has been useless. Nothing I ever wished for, wanted, or hoped for ever came to pass. "
It's not about me. I need advice.,I have a best friend. She's actually my ex. We split up less than two months ago. She's a wonderful person but we drifted apart. Being how wonderful she is I decided she should be my friend. But I have a problem. She has always been depressed and has anxiety. In all our time together I was her rock. Today (tonight) she was telling me that she can't take it anymore. She wants to die. She tells me that she can't survive without me to be there for her. The things that held her in a better place were the warm touch and the feeling that I am there for her no matter what. When she couldn't get out of bed or off the floor I was there to pick her up. When she couldn't eat I made her soup to drink. If she couldn't drink I got watermelon so she could get water when she eats. I did these things because I saw her pain. I loved her. I still love her. The problem is I couldn't keep being dragged down with her. When she got bad I got bad. I kept it to myself but I hurt. I would get depressed. No motivation. No care to take care of myself. But when she was there I would hide it. So we drifted apart. We split up. I am still trying to be there for her but I can't be that. What I was. She is asking me to look after the dog that she got in the split. I know this might sound like she is emotionally abusive to some. But trust me it's not. I'm a sympathetic emotional. But I don't let anyone in. She never forced me or abused me. And now she is saying without me she will never get better. She says she'll never find anything. I tell her she will and she still has me no matter what. I just don't know what to do. When she gets this way I get angry. She doesn't see it or hear it. But all I want to do is punch a wall. In part because I can't help and in part because it's taking me down again. I need some advice. How can I help her? How can I make things better? She's scared of therapists because of a bad session. She hates pills because they make her sick. I don't know what to do. Sorry its so long. If you can't help its OK I needed to vent mostly. Any advice is much appreciated.
Upset at Me,"My mom got upset at me when I said ""I hope I die in my sleep."" She said something like, ""don't say something like that!""I used to be far more vocal about it but I still always want to die. I just haven't said it in a while and she got shocked."
I am the only one who can fix myself,"And that thought is infuriating. Why can't be there some kind of brain surgery that fixes being lazy as shit all the time, so I can stop forcing myself to do work?I just realized that everything is my responsibility. I have to be the one who must fix myself. There's no cure, surgery or any therapy that can make me feel better - it's always has to be me that has to force being motivated.It makes me not try therapy at all. I'll probably have to keep a journal or some useless shit that I will forget about. I just wish there was some kind of happy pill that makes me super productive. Maybe then I'd finally be successful in live.But alas, I'm a lazy piece of shit and I refuse to improve myself. Fuck it. I'd rather die than try anything."
I have no food and I can't starve anymore.,"I'm broke, someone stole my bank info so my check is being held until Monday. I'm so sick of living like this. I'm sick of hearing it'll get better. I don't have the time. My sister in law ate all of my food and refuses to put gas in our car even though she shares it and we drive 5 miles while she drives 35. I'm going to take the trazodone I've saved and get in the tub tonight. I'll drown and it'll be easy enough to clean up. I'm sorry to my husband, I love you so much. You're all I've had. I'm sorry to my parents. I can't do this anymore. "
i have a plan but no day.,"and the thoughts are only getting worse, they are constant now but i still feel so empty, i wish i could feel the darkness that is hovering over me. i hope i can fall into the deep depression soon so i will have the motive to end it. im so tired of living."
I need help to figure out,"What do I have on handf to end it? Some alcohol to numb but can't slit my wrists, pills would be good."
Can't.,I don't want to do this alone.
Failed attempt,"I can't decide if my blade wasn't sharp enough, or if a part of me really didn't want to do it. Either way, I barely cut deep down enough to leave a scar. Or 5 scars. I tried quite a few times. "
I just wanna cry,"My life sucks. I have no bright future, im poor and im ugly. I'm so alone and sad and my family is in pieces. I got so depressed today that I social media stalked my ex from 3 years ago (when I was in highschool) and found out she's now engaged. I miss her..she was the only relationship I ever had. Isn't that sad? I don't get sleep at night because my brain doesn't shut off. I'm ruined mentally because of my family problems and I have no solution for it.  My stepmom is suicidal, my sister ran away from home and my dad is about to go to prison for assault. We have no money, no savings and my stepmom is mentally ruined....I don't know why I wrote this out but I thought it would help. I have a migraine Help me"
If I was genuinely suicidal I would rob a bank,People that aren't suicidal often think that. But a person who is suicidal doesn't care about money.
"I feel so weak, and pathetic. Full of regret and hatred. I want to die.","I met this girl during my childhood, we were both 5, so we decided to ""date"" even though I didnt know what love was til I was 7.
(Dont ask why I was dating at the age of 5, I didn't know why myself ._. )
We were both 16 at the time.
Me and her have been close and in a relationship for ALMOST 11 years.
I went to my highschool, was a sophomore at the time.
I had a horrible day.
Just all these teachers were so horrible.
none of them gave any fucks to anyone.
students picking fights with me because they think I ""Act"" cool because im always quiet.
What the actual fuck, thats a reason to pick a fight with somebody?! wtf.
anyways I came back, was sooooo stressed. decided to take the anger out on the wall.
Made a couple holes, kinda calmed down and panicked cause if anyone seen that whole I wouldve been dead( I would be fine dead now tbh.)
I was so stressed, I called my girlfriend over.
She came 20 minutes later walking towards my house.
We talk, and watched videos.
She texted her father, that shes going to spend the night with me.
then its like... 11 in the morning (This was on friday)
So we were just cuddling next to eachother while watching an anime.
Then she said that if im calm now.
Then I instantly snapped and I punched the wall again, making another hole.
I dont know if I have a problem or something but, when she said that it made me feel like I went through everything again x15.
she was scared, I apologized and went to the bathroom.
She knocked on the door and said if I was alright.
I told her to get ready for bed.
I was crying of how stupid I was at the time.
I wanted to die just because of a single day of a very bad school day.
I layed down behind her, holding her in my arms and she said if im alright cause i was still crying.
I told her that school was very stressful that day.
I went to sleep, while she was in my arms.
and then around 15 minutes (Kinda feels longer cause I was asleep)
She asked if she could help calm me down.
I said it was fine she didnt need to, but she wanted to.
so, we did it.
Probably one of the biggest regrets ive ever done.
right when im about to finish up near the end, I kept going. I dont know why. all I know is it felt so good so I kept going.
she said stop once, didnt stop.
said stop twice, didnt stop
and then she yelled at me and said ""stop""
Thats when I started, you know.
after that I was breathing heavily, and then I start having an anxiety attack.
I was overthinking, like ""Oh shit I fucking cummed in her oh fuck what am I going to do what the fuck is going on""
and all I can think about is everything flashing and the noises got distorted then I heard voices in my head.
passed out and woke up in a hospital bed. I don't know what happened at the time.
anyways it didnt occur to me at the time, til like a week later and im like ""wait didnt I just have sex a while ago?""
Called my girlfriend, she said I did cum in her, and I was about to drop the phone and have another attack til she said that she wanted the kid..I wasnt ready at all.
Like il be responsible from now on if I have a kid... but if she had that kid, her life would be going through hell.
her father knew about it and was STRICT AS FUCK.
Didnt try to kill me though, just said ""if you love him, then stay with him.""
I guess I was happy..
Month later im at my friends party, drinking some alcohol.
I don't know why so don't ask if I have a problem..
I didnt feel any different though and nothing bad has happened.
I left the party near 2 in the morning or so?
Started texting my little brother, whos just a year younger than me, and I asked if he was alright.
while I was waiting for a text back, I stopped by my girlfriends house to see if she was there, asked her father and he said shes at her friends house.
I carried on walking home, still no text. I start getting a little bit worried.
I started trying to call. went straight to voicemail, and then blocked.
so I started getting really scared.
I ran the rest of the way home, thinking he was being held at gun point or some other horrible stuff.
Walking upstairs, I hear noises.
Not normal noises.
It was coming from my brothers room, I opened the door a little bit.
quickly walked in.
and at this point, I wanted to kill myself.
my brother was fucking my girlfriend.
I ran out the door. Fell down the stairs due to me thinking it was a STRAIGHT WALKWAY.
Wish I broke my neck.
I survived it, and I just ran away.
about 8/9 hours later I get picked up by some Officers.
It was a ""Search party"" for me.
Which was a waste of time.
was taken back home by my 'mom'
Went home to check if my brother was still in the room, he wasnt.
I asked where he went, turns out he went to his grandpa's house for the night.
Im walking to school the next day with my sister.
and I seen my brother, a freshman at the time.
I started running towards him and I threw one punch and knocked him out.
Went on him and started beating him to death, he didnt die sadly.
I know its fucked up, Ive suffered a lot alright? Dont blame me for his reason of almost dying.
Out of no where ""security"" stops me, I GET FUCKING ARRESTED, WAIT WHAT?!
LMAO. fucking ""Savior of the US"" puts me in the back of a car to a little private jail cell thing, was in there for a week or so til my punishment was over SOMEHOW.
I walked home.
After I go in my sister comes from the couch and starts crying and she run towards me and started hugging me saying ""I miss you""
Shes the same age as me, we're twins, Boy and girl.
My sister said I should come back later because our 'mom' was very mad.
So here I am walking in the kitchen, instantly gets yelled at.
""GET THE FUCK OUT"" ""YOU HURT MY BABY, I DONT WANT YOU TO BE HERE""
He isnt a fucking baby hes literally a year younger than me.
I got kicked out, transferred schools, and was homeless.
Walked near 20 miles or so to my new highschool, and I was waiting for the weekend to end so I can go eat breakfest, I was on the edge of just killing myself cause I was starving to the point where it hurts.
got my classes, went to eat, 5th period lunch came by, went to get lunch and then sit at an empty table not near any student, this was like a ""loner"" table outside of the lunch areas.
Girl walks up to me and I said I'd leave.
she said it was fine, nobody really goes there.
as she says..
So I started talking with her a lot.
a couple weeks later she found out I was homeless when I kept sleeping in the park near the corner of the school.
she told me she wants me to follow her afterschool tomorrow.
So I went with her, met her mother, nice lady.
She asked me a lot of questions that went between 30-40 minutes. and then finally said, that I can live there.
I was crying so hard and kept saying thank you nonstop.
Then I passed out on the carpet floor.
then I seen somebody whisper my name, which was VERY FUCKING CREEPY cause it came from the dark hallway, seen too many scary movies to know whats going to happen.
then my friend turns on the light and told me to follow her.
She took me to her room, turned on a little lamp and said ""here""
So I said thanks, then I layed back on the floor in HER room.
She was like ""what're you doing?""
Turns out she was inviting me to her bed.
and I felt like loved again, 4 months later my sister somehow tracked my phone down just to find me, it was raining, I heard the doorbell ring and I opened it, it was my sister crying.
Then she was frozen for a second, then said ""Chris"" and walked in and hugged me.
I never realized I meant anything to anyone anymore.
She told us a while later that she was being abused mentally and emotionally because she told our 'mother' that she was BI.
And then I started to get heated really quickly..
4 months later, while im waiting for these 2 slowpokes to dress out from PE in 7th period, I wait outside in the front.
Then I started looking at cars, which lead my eyes to my 'girlfriend' who came off the city bus.
I was going to just ignore her.
she sits right next to me and tries to make me talk to her.
then she said ""Chris, its a girl, isnt that what you wanted?"" (I did want a girl in the future)
and im still silent.
then she said that shes sorry and that shes stupid and how everything wasnt planned like that.
She said she wanted to ""start over"" and ""make up""
I got up and started shouting at her.
saying how could I forgive her for cheating on me WITH MY FUCKING BROTHER.
Started yelling about more shit.
then I yelled ""why dont you just go fucking die""
Started running towards the house I live at, looking back, shes crying and on the floor very red.
Nobody was home, its usually me, my sister, and my friend home first, and then 2 hours later the parents come back.
I started throwing glass.
Started ripping stuff.
Started doing all type of stuff.
I threw my piano out the window, just put it in position and pushed it out. A lot of the keys flew out.
I grabbed a knife out of the cabinent.
and I was ready to stab myself.
all you hear in the background is yelling and running.
sister charged at me and pretty much made me fall to the ground, she got on top and started saying how could I just kill myself, after all that me and her been through (Before my 'girlfriend', me and my sister would spend time A LOT.)
And she started crying , her tears went on my shirt, and she started yelling at me saying that she knows life isnt fair and always good. but I shouldnt kill myself over that, AS SHE SAID.
so I gave up and just dropped the knife and hugged my sister while she lets her tears run down.
we replaced all the glass and ripped stuff.
next day im in a bed.
Got like 29 texts out of no where from all randoms.
got a text saying ""SHES DEAD CAUSE OF YOU"" ""FUCKING KILL YOURSELF"" etcetc... then one of them was kind enough to say what happened.
My ex commited suicide the day I yelled at her.
I felt so heartbroken.
I felt so lonely and depressed.
so I decided to hang myself.
Didnt really end well.
wasnt tight enough, knot untied itself and landed face first into the floor.
Passed out.
Wakes up in bed with my friend, the one who I live with, holding my hand while her head is on the bed.
After I moved, she woke up and said ""Thank god"" and pulled me close.
I wanted to die so bad.
She said she heard the news about my ex killing herself, but doesnt know what made her kill herself.
after a while, fathers day came by.
Got SERIOUSLY fucking depressed.
Decided to try to jump off the roof.
my friend, again, pulls me from the outside rooftop into the window into her bedroom.
and she started yelling at me, saying stop. saying how I shouldnt be like this.  etc.
So I decided to change my life around.
About 6 months pass, the day I finally talked to my crush after being very shy.
Shes a very awesome rare kind of girl you find.
We hanged out a LOT.
then I asked if she wanted to go to the movies with a couple friends of mine when she comes back from her summer trip to paris, the ""couple of friends of mine"" were dating at the time but broke up later.
So I went to the movies with my friends, and picked up the girl I liked for a while.
we watched movies, an action movie, scary movie, which was my favorite thing because she would get scared and hold my side.
then an emotional romance movie.
End of the movie finally.
I pulled her closer to me, then she got up and said its almost 1 AM, and her parents just msged her saying she has to come home now.
So while we were walking back to the car, one of my friends that went with the movies with us grabbed our other friend and said ""We gotta go to the bathroom"" Just so me and her were alone.
I said ""Emma, I was thinking, what do you find in a man?""
She said a nice caring person, who was EXACTLY ME :3
Not really :/
Anyways it led to the point of me asking her out.
She just, ignored me as if I said something. She asked if I did say anything, I said no after that due to shyness kicking in.
So I asked her out right when we get out the car near her house.
She said ""Looks chris this isnt going to work out, I already like somebody""
So I was like, oh yea...thats fine.. Its alright.
I felt dead inside
next day I asked how she was, then I was curious and I texted her saying ""why wouldnt it work out"" because im stupid and she already said that she liked somebody...so I asked more dumb questions because my anxiety started kicking in and I started overreacting then she sent me a long message
""Who the fuck said I didnt care? How the fuck did I hurt you, I never said I liked you too, I never said I love you too. I never said something to you i didnt mean, but you're too butthurt to realize that. When you asked if I liked someone, I didnt lie to you, I even told you who it was""
Im bursting into tears at this rate.
Im wanting to die a lot more.
Got in contact with her crush, turns out he likes her also, so I secretly told him about it, because I made emma, the girl I liked, feel stressful, so I decided to try to make her life happy as possible.
Told her crush everything that happened between me and her, then he started getting closer with emma, and emma didnt realize that he liked her also.
Then she brought it up in a conversation we had later on.
She said  ""my friend might send him a message saying if he likes me back""
I said I know the truth, I said we both talked.
She said ""You told him I liked him?!""
I said yes, then it all turned well when I said he likes her back.
then she says ""Oh my god chris you are the fucking best""
then I said ""Yea sure I am.."", even though I wasnt the dude that she wants......
then she said ""Next time I see you im going to give you one of the biggest hugs I can offer""
Without hesitation, I said ""Save it for somebody who you actually love.""
I wasnt pissed, but I was jealous.
And now, shes lost feelings for him.
So now I feel like I wasted my own tears, and time, and effort to try to put them together to make her happy.
All gone.
Ive lost my house, family, my EX, my future daughter,my crush, and my hope in living.
I'm crying over fucking love for fucks sake.
Why can't I just die."
Got asked questions about my suicidal tendancies by a new clinic and its made me uncomfortable.,Going through some huge changes at the minute including moving out my parents house. I signed up for a new mental health counsellor then got an urgant call back in response to the severity of my desire to kill myself. Ive been pretfy good recently and i think when i move out my life will start picking up again but just saying out loud my thoughts on killing myself and being reminded how uncommon(?) & intense those thoughts are. I do find some days unbearable but im doing my best to love myself and not be full of self hatred.
How to save a life...,"A person with suicidal thoughts is not normal... and they know it...
For many a years they will fight to be normal try to do normal people things that make normal people normal though they don't know they are normal because being normal is everyday for them even when bad things happen to them the are simply cured by doing the normal things with other normal people.
But we don't even have the normal things to rely on no regular friends who would come over for tea and a chat, a mad sesh on the town, or even a phone call, be it bffs, work or a an activity.
And when they finally do travel so far down the lonely road with only their thoughts for company and jump, shoot, swallow and kick... everyone wonders why they never came to them I mean they would always be their if they asked it says so in the facebook post...
Always here, are you ?_��__��__��__��__��_
I would like to see five of my friends post this message (not sharing) to show that you are always there if someone needs to talk. I think I know who will xxYou can never be part of the normals when they finally learn how damaged and truly abnormal you are, talking doesn't help it just creates a toxic dependency that no side wants inclusion in the normals is all we want being part of the group being wanted and thought of when anything is going down helps so much people would probably live if the people in their lives helped them to live instead of remind them of how abnornal they are...
I know this because I was pulled from a river after my fifth attempt the first public one so now the people closest to me know and still they leave me alone despite declarations of help and company being only a text or phone call away...
They never reply... they never come and I am still barely here wishing to be normal but instead we are alone with our past, our pain and reality
stop talking and start doing invite the weird kid from class to the cinema, the shy colleague to the work night out, the mom who never leaves the house because kids... just let them know you see them its all we want"
"Question for those on here who try to ""help.""","Why do you comment on posts here? Why does it matter to you? Why is it so important to you that people who hate being alive, who can't bare another minute of existence, keep on keeping on? Why do you want us to force ourselves to live out a miserable existence until we inevitably die one day anyway? Why is it important to you that we continue to suffer rather than allow ourselves to be at peace?"
Still here. Got so drunk I passed out so I didn't kill myself. I woke up in a shitty hostel. With a huge bump on my forehead. I didn't even know how that happened. I have lost 10 pounds in one week. I can't. I'm seeking help.,"Hey there!
I'm glad you're still with us, and I hope you will be here for a long time. Let's have a chat and talk about how you're feeling right now? I'm up for anything."
I feel so fucking weak,"Goddammit. I feel fucking cursed. Why. The. Fuck. Can't. I Feel. Happy? Why am I so fucking stupid and immature? Why can't I just feel fucking ok and fucking stay that way for good? Why can't I just fucking BE who I want to be without falling apart every time? I'm scared my mom's not gonna be around too much longer and I just can't stop thinking about how much of a disappointment of a son I am to both my parents, and to myself for that matter. Why can't be a normal, functional fucking person? Why do I have to be mentally fucking ill? Because it seems like the only way to ever be rid of it is to be fucking dead. My life has already been a complete waste."
I just realized i'll never ever like myself,Why keep on living. Life is painful it's not worth it to live with something I despise
I'm...I don't know.,"Do you know what drawing and quartering is? I feel like that is what is happening to my mind; but instead of it finally being torn apart it's just left lingering in an everlasting state of ""almost there"". There is just so much pressure. Fears, failures, questions, expectations, changes, trauma, anxiety. It's almost like I'm feeling so much that it's being registered as nothing at all. I just...I don't know. I don't even know what has caused this- this weight. But I know that my mind has been in varying stages of being drawn and quartered for the past year or so. It's just so much. Too much. I'm not built for this. I'm too young to be able to handle this. I can't do this."
Dude I can't live,"I need help!! I wish I had people to talk to.It's all over.Three months ago (probably longer now) I lost my friend (because my friend that makes all my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead got her to hate me completely, I already have him blocked and know he's a toxic friend now) and now I miss my friend (not the toxic friend but the other one)and I go to her tumblr page and she .. I like the same things she likes... but I tried to talk to her again yesterday, and she blocked me.. Her tumblr has all this stuff about anime and cartoons and games that I like, and I think we'd be good friends.. We were good friends for two years on tumblr (and 11 years before that, although I didn't see her for ten of them) before my friend made her dislike me..And my mom says I'm not allowed to get a 12-pack for three weeks because I stole a little bit of my dad's scotch a couple days ago.And now I don't know how to deal with all of these little annoyances. I woke up, and I heard my mom's breathing machine and it sounds so annoying and I can't sleep like that either and I just wanted to do something horrible. But then I realize, they'll probably ban me from alcohol even longer. My dad's coming home soon. I wanna explode and say that I really want beer tomorrow even though I stole his scotch the other day. But they say that's the only punishment I can have.And I got up and went to the bathroom and again my mom ran to the downstairs bathroom and tried talking to me from the downstairs bathroom. So I went on the computer, and a bug landed on my screen. And both of my internet routers (I don't know why we have two, every time I bring it up my dad acts like I'm crazy and then says he doesn't realize we even had two routers) keep not working out good so my internet keeps dieing and I keep having to unplug and replug both of my routers constantly,and I keep venting over and over on Tumblr again about how I miss my friend that my friend made dislike me, but no one is interacting with me. And I can't stand my mom harassing me and stuff. She says even though I'm 30 years old, I can't buy new pants with my money to replace the dorky pants I have that always make me too hot, because she bought me these pants when I was in school and she doesn't want me to replace them. Everyone says my mom always babies me. She's going to die soon, though. She's on a breathing machine and stuff.I can't live. I feel bad that I lost my friend. She keeps posting stuff on her Tumblr that I relate to too.. I was always her friend until my best friend that always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead, made her not like me.. Same with my crush that always says I'm ""hers"" (she says ""mine"") and if I ever block her, she posts on her facebook ""Let's dig up some dirt on [me]"" or she says ""My sisters say you're like Chris-chan, but I don't know"" then she'll block me if she's mad at me (I looked it up and saw she was trying to insult me for having aspberger's I guess)and right now I just hear the downstairs TV and I can't make out the words it just sounds so annoying!And my dad's gonna come home and drink scotch soon and watch TV. I really wish I had beer on friday, at least next week.And I feel really bad that I can't get my friend to see me who I am and my existence is being denied.And I keep posting on Tumblr but no one's talking to me on there. And I can't stand my mom always harassing me. And I really miss my friend ;___; ok I already said that..I actually was not supposed to message my friend because she said a lot that she'll get me into trouble if I do and that she considers it harassment if I message her again, but I keep trying to tell her that my friend was wrong about me, I literally don't even know why she stopped talking to me, she doesn't want to communicate with me.. But I keep messaging her, even though her friend told me that her dad is a cop and she'll get me into trouble if I talk to her again, because now that I can't drink beer for three weeks, I literally can not deal with all the annoyances that happen every day throughout the week, and I figure its ok if I keep messaging this girl cuz my life is completely over anyways and I wish I could show her that I'm not a bad person, although I admit its bad to disrespect her wishes and message her when she told me not to, but I'm not even sure why, other than that my best friend convinced her to not like me anymore because ""all I do is make crappy Hamtaro fangames"" and stuff aahI just woke up from hearing my mom's breathing machine, I can hear it in my room when I'm laying down and I can't think to myself in bed anymore =("
My brother tried to kill himself. How can I help? I need advice.,"try and do things hes interested in with him, like if he likes horror movies, take him to IT, or if he likes video games play some games with him or something. just do things he likes with him to take his mind off of it"
Came closer today than before.,"I was parking my car in the garage, and had a serious thought about closing the garage door and keeping the car running. Then, when I got inside my house, I caught myself looking for razors to slit my wrists. I feel like the thoughts I'm having are becoming more severe and are almost manifesting."
Should I call the police?,"My girlfriend and I had a fight earlier at night. I fell asleep and didn't realize she was sending me messages begging me to answer her. Her last message said ""If I'm gone tonight, I love you"" I'm freaking out because I'm afraid she did something. I was knocking on the door to her house at 2 am and no one answered me, I'm pretty sure her mom, brother and sister were home.
I've been bombarding her phone with calls and she doesn't answer. Not sure if she put it on silent or I'm fearing the worst"
I've just finished all my suicide letters.,"I've been thinking about what to say and have been walking around with them half finished for a while now. I'm going to wait a week, and if things don't change, then I'm flying to California. Getting a hotel. And hanging myself. I'm not looking for anyone to try and change my mind. I'm just putting it out in the universe. I wish everyone the best, I wish you all luck in all your choices, I wish I was loved more. I'll post updates about my trip. Hopefully it'll help science or someone else or whatever. "
I could just use someone to talk to tbh,"Everything in my life is sorta falling apart and I wish I was dead. I haven't seen any of my friends in three months, I guess we aren't really friends anymore seeing as I dropped off the face of the earth. I'm chronically ill so I'm always having to talk to doctors and about being sick, I haven't had a conversation that doesn't involve my illness in months, it's always ""look at this new study!"" or ""my symptoms are flaring"" or strangers asking ""why do you have a cane?"". I'd really like to just have a conversation with someone about normal things. There's a cute girl in my English class I think I have a crush on and I got a 90% on my first quiz in my college trig class! Just normal young people stuff. "
I can't take it any more. This is the lowest I've been,"I recently betrayed the trust of one of my close friends and it's really bearing on me. I met her online through some mutual friends about 2 years ago and started physically hanging out early last year. Over the course of our time together I did develop some romantic feelings towards her, but never planned on acting on them. One night about a few weeks back, we had planned to hang out and do shrooms. Now I had never done anything like that before and was admittedly pretty uneasy about the whole thing especially because she had LSD instead. But I did it anyway thinking it was going to be ok. She told me I didn't have to do it if I didn't want to, but I did it anyway because I thought things would be ok. Big mistake.So it started out ok and was even a little enjoyable however about a hour or so in (I honestly couldn't tell you how long) I got really scared. I had lost all perception of time and reality and panicked a little. Some time along the way I decided to bury my face into her breasts maybe as a means of finding comfort. I took things too far and attempted to take her breasts out of her shirt. The sad thing is I did this at least 3 times, one time even dry humping her. I have to admit as well that I'm still a virgin and am pretty pent up. The next day after I woke up I apologize and she told me that's not who I really was.However things between us are a little weird. She's understandingly upset with me and hasn't talked to me outside of a few messages here and there. We've only talked about that night once and it wasn't a good time. I even told her about how I did have some romantic feelings for her (which in hindsight was a pretty bad idea). We are still friends on Facebook even after that last big discussion. And since we live far apart, I can't just go see her and talk about this face to face. I'm about 2 weeks away from seeing a therapist, but I don't know how much more I can take.I would love to keep being friends with her as well.  I don't know if it's possible, but I legitimately enjoy her as a person and don't want to loose a friend if I can help it. I'm going to keep trying though. I'm giving her some space for the time being. I'm slowly losing it though as more time passes. I'm not normally like this and like to think I am respectful towards women. I have been known to get touchy while drunk, but NEVER anything like that.I thought about suicide before, but now it's almost every other thought. I am so depressed and I feel like it's getting worse. I take some solace that I was on LSD while it happened, but the fact of the matter is I fucked up. I'm a horrible person and don't deserve this life"
I'm Just Demotivated Towards Doing Anything,"I hate life. I'm fucking tired of life and living. I feel like there is nothing that makes me happy.I don't have friends (well I do, but I'm a social outcast) and I'm too ugly to date. I'm just tired of things.I don't like spending time with friends. I'm tired of being the lone wolf. The kissless, handholdless, virgin.I'm tired of hearing the ""be yourself"" crap. Personality doesn't make for being ugly. Ever.I just wish I wasn't born in the first place.Oh, don't give me the ""I'm sure you're not ugly."" Do you even know me? I'm ugly.The only thing I care about is having a partner who finds me worth of dating and where I'm worthy of having sex with.I'll never experience that. Ever. For my entire life.Even if I find a hooker, I'll never be worthy of actually being loved. I know she'll just be in for the money and then want to be out of it ASAP.I've had dreams of going on a date, holding hands with a girl who I love and who loves me back. I was in bliss during those times and them woke up and realized how much of it was false and then cried and cried before jumping in the shower to go to work."
The realization that you're gonna have to die,"Pretty much how I feel right now. This is my first time writing here. I feel like I could have at many points before, but now it feels like I have truly reached the end and there is nowhere else to go.It has been a long fucking year. 2017 in general has been but I've attempted suicide twice in the last 12 months. Last October was a very serious attempt, and then in April was a half assed attempt where I took a bunch of pills and then threw them up shortly after.I'm 27 now and while I have been dealing with depression and extreme highs/lows all my life, it has always been very fleeting. I'd have a few days of crying and then it'd go away. Well it wouldn't go away, but it'd be in the back of my mind and I'd move on and stuff. I was also never considering suicide at those points no matter how hopeless I was. It was something I thought about for sure, but at the time I never gave it serious thought.In February I had some things happen to me that triggered a full blown depression. For 2.5 months, til mid-April, I was crying almost every day, stopped talking to many people, and didn't do much of anything. It was bad. For most of it I was only considering suicide half the time, and after my attempt in April I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't go through with another serious attempt until I tried everything possible to improve my life.Well here I am. I'm literally failing at what is my last resort in life. I've always had another path to take but I am seriously out of options now. This was the end of the line. The only thing going right for me is that I am living in my ideal city. Everything else I am failing at.27 years old now and every attempt I have made to change things has failed miserably. I try to make things better but it only results in making things worse. These last few months my goals have to been to rebuild my life here in this city that I love but so much has gone wrong in the process.I honestly don't know how much longer I will make it. Days or weeks. My hole keeps getting deeper and deeper. My intention was to reverse all this by winter but things have gone wrong so fast that I don't know how they got here.And I am slowly beginning to feel like I did in February. All this makes me wondering why I should be alive if I've pulled out all the stops and come up short."
I feel so depressed about time,"I feel like I waste too much time on stuff that I don't like doing. I don't like my job, I work 9 hours for a shit payment and I can't even save a single dollar from it, not cause I spend too much, I need to give 60% of my earning to my mum and other money that's left I need to pay the bills so I can't buy stuff and I can't have a good time or I can't save up for a car let's say. I have this girl that I've been for a year now and when I spend time with her it's all good, but when she's not here it just feel so alone, I have to work, come home, spend alone time because she is not from my town and I don't have a car so I can go to her place. And i'm just wondering, am I going to feel so alone all the time? What is the purpose of all this? I need a higher meaning, I feel like I can be so much more in life, like this isn't what I'm supposed to be, and who am I supposed to be, I feel like I can be great, I don't like doing much things, and my work is depressing as fuckk and I always come home tired..... I don't know what to do. Today I didn't go to job because I was just so bored... I need something in my life, I wanna be somebody, I don't wanna waste my time on things that I don't like doing. I wanna do the things that I love and that makes me happy. I don't wanna be unhappy!!!"
Best Place?,Does anyone in UK know best place to jump in front of a train? I'm talking with less security etc. Thanks
Pitfalls of speaking with a counsellor?,"I've been clinically depressed and suicidal for the past 6 years, and I've scheduled to speak with both a counselor at my university and a private psychiatrist. This is the first time I've tried to seek help but, I'm not going to lie, I'm terrified of speaking with someone about it. I know the experience will be for the better, especially if I can get some medication to help, but I know that I cannot tell the psychiatrist (and certainly not the university's counselor) about wanting to die or my previous attempt. My mom told me that if I were to say this to either of them, I would likely be taken out of school and put in a psychiatric hospital, which I'd like to avoid if possible. If I can figure out some way to get treatment, I know that I've got a strong future ahead of me, at least in terms of career prospects and intellect. Does anybody know of any potential pitfalls or topics to avoid when speaking with a counselor or a psychiatrist? Anything helps. Thanks."
I want to be dead.,"I don't want to die, I just want to be dead. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide."
Weird one. Kind of want to kill myself. But also don't.,I don't even know what is going through my head right now. I want to be dead. But I don't. I don't want to cause that pain to my wife. My family. My friends. I don't want to be thought of anymore. By anyone. I just want to not exist. One day. Maybe.
Multi-month mental healthcare wait times are inhumane,Fuck you Manitoba healthcare.I don't want my suicide to harm others. I want to get better. But how am I supposed to pass the time while in an episode of major depression?
Im sad,"I cant remember anytime Ive truly been happy. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that my family would be destroyed if I killed myself, and that my brother is gonna probably end his life if Im not there for him."

How did I ruin my life so fast?,"How do I even begin. I'm about to just let my life go, because I've already fucked it beyond seemingly repair.
I'm 27, gay white male living in Texas. I just totally fucked up my life. I just found out I am HIV positive and another std.  I started sleeping around exactly one month ago, mostly unprotected. 14 people I should contact. Most of them were not ""high risk"" contacts but this particular strain of chlamydia is resistant. During that month I did meth for the first time, and have gotten addicted in less than two weeks. I am shocked at everything about this drug. It is the closest thing to Satan on earth. I cannot believe that, just a month ago, I was successful and had a decently good life. After beating homelessness for 6 months, and keeping my shit together then, I am so angry at myself for not being in control now. I wonder why all the recklessness and what triggered that. I guess I have always wanted to kill myself (I say it to myself nearly every day) but I never had thought it would be because or this. I am doing research and will have to pass along all my findings to someone else, I have done nothing else with my life, barely have done anything else other than good grades 3.92 mcl and PBK, and I am so ashamed of my life now. I cannot go on. I have access to nitrogen lines, and have tracked my O2 sats, and you are out in 15 seconds. I just don't want my lab partners to find my body. "
Why I Don't Care to be Here,"1.) Childhood trauma and strict parents enforced my anxiety2.) Growing up as an only child with strict parents hindered my social skills3.) Getting bullied in school killed my self esteem4.) Having no one to turn to when things got bad resulted in self loathing5.) Finally finding someone who loved me only for her to leave me for someone else (with possible cheating months prior) two years down the line shattered my heart, and has left me in pieces. 6.) Being in uni has killed my confidence even further because I don't know how to make friends, I'm super stressed out, and I procrastinate too much.7.) My mind allows me to belittle myself at every step, and I don't know how to get out of the cycle.8.) I can't believe anyone wants me for me, I can't believe that I have value, and when I try, I just feel like I'm lying to myself"
For the last time,I'm done. Every time before Ive been here I thought it was it then but this time I know I don't have anything left to live forI'm disabled and can barely work/study I can't live with my parents they're toxicI'm trans and my friends won't even acknowledge it they're my best friends in the world and they still think I'm sinning I think God has abandoned me and I don't know why My one thing that kept me alive for impossibly long which was writing music about my struggles is coming to an end I can feel it. No one's ever going to hear it. No one's ever going to care. I don't have money to record it and the only thing stopping me is that it will die with me I'm a worthless failed human being. There's nowhere I feel safe and loved and it's only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I used to believe a miracle could save me but not any moreIf anyone wants to try to talk me down go for it but I don't think it's gonna work. What can you say that I haven't already tried on myself?
School is killing me,"I literally don't know what to do anymore. I am only in high school and school makes me want to kill myself. I am in all honor's and AP courses and I don't know what to do. My stress levels are through the roof and every time something comes up about school I want to cry. My friends try to help but they can't. All my teachers make me useless and dumb. On top of that I am in the marching band which is an almost all the time commitment and I just feel like crying. Last year I felt like I was on top of the world and I turned in all my work on time, but now I have a 375 point project due on Monday (It's Saturday) I have two quizzes on the same day I am going to fail a different 100 point project, I have six chapters of a history textbook to read by Tuesday, I have band practice after school every tuesday and thursday I have three pages of chem hw due tuesday oh and i forgot to mention that along with those six chapters of the history textbook I have to read I also have an essay due that day and I literally am debating on killing myself because I can't do this anymore. It's only about the fifth week of school and I have already had four break downs and like zero sleep. Help me."
I feel hopelessness,"I am going to throw this out there, I am 12. So I really hope what I'm feeling is just stupid teenage hormones but here we go (the story is going to be jambled sorry)
Almost everyday all I feel is anger, frustration, hopelessness, anxiety, and sadness. I wake up everyday either anxious, mad, or depressed. I never get much sleep for a night and the next day I sleep for a whole day. Sometimes I get a slightly normal sleep schedule but I don't feel much better.
Mainly around when school happens my mood reaches the worst. Everyday I'm told to kill myself, I feel like I'm smart for some seconds to only realize that I was completely wrong, and bullied more and more about my appearance (I'm really ugly and fat). I have Show Choir which further decreases my self-esteem because we have to look at ourselves and all I see is an ugly angry 12 year old who shouldn't exist and I get worse and worse because I get tired so quickly and I feel depressed.
I ask my parents if I can go to online school, but they think it won't work and yell at me just for mentioning it.
Remembering, I had this depressive behavior since 2nd grade where I would draw myself as a dead body. (I was bullied since kindergarten)
If I ever get angry or upset my mom makes fun of me for it mocking me at how I complain.
I even have stupid childish behaviors like I still suck my finger, I didn't potty train myself til I was 11, and I still carry around a blanket.
I hate everyday how I get compared to my sister. Everyday someone compares me with my sister.
I feel worse about school also as I have murder impulses. I never hurt anyone but I many times wanted to. I remember last week in Science a girl was picking on me and I almost went up to her and wanted to strangle her and kill her slowly. I became so guilty because of that I became scared that one day I will hurt someone.
Every time I try to rant somewhere, it gets labeled as ""just some over-reactive 12 year old"" so I always bottle everything up. If I yell at my parents I'm instantly grounded.
I can have times where I'm extremely motivated then I quickly stop being motivated.
I have a such a bad habit I think I might have a superiority complex. If I'm talking to someone, I have to find something that makes me feel better and more valued, but nothing ever makes me feel better.
I tried to kill myself multiple times with a knife but my own cowardliness made me not do it. Closest I've been was ween I was 9 and almost slit my throat.
I also see things and hear this horrible ringing or pounding in my ears many times. I see things in the corner in my eye, in my bed I think I'm being stalked sometimes (even tho i highly am not) and I see random things slightly. Like right now on the white background I see a face of a demon opening its mouth.
I can't go to my bedroom without an external noise and all the lights on. I had so many horrible nightmares and fears and all these bad things I can't go up there.
I feel things crawling on me 24/7 and I always feel itchy somewhere.
I hate being touched. I wasn't sexually touched or anything its just I get so scared of being touched as lots of times in school people hit me.
I get very bad nightmares to the point where I don't want to sleep because of it.
I get violent shivers some times.
I can't cross roads at all (when I was younger I was almost hit by a car) and I get intense anxiety crossing them
TL;DR: I feel extremely sad and depressed and some other random things
Please help me get rid of this pain"
"Update: ""I just finished all my suicide letters.""","I told my husband I'd be home tonight, despite spending a couple nights out for space. Nothing was done wrong except a bad fight. I've been trying to call him to come home. To maybe save me. And he's not answering. I can't find him. I'm sitting here with a noose and I just want him to save me. "
Myself,"Tonight I just want to get everything out and speak my peace and leave my peace and please can anyone help me
 When I was born I lived with my parents and my 5 sisters in a nice part of the world so pretty sweet ride ahead sadly this isn't the case. When I was 2 my dad had a heart attack and died leaving me fatherless and our family broken. Then my sister died from an epileptic seizure leaving my family in pieces but yet we pulled through. Then 6th grade came, I had missed the first the day because I had been away on holidays when I came back everything was awful I had a panic attacks and had to leave the classroom to be put into another room. I had to get help from every teacher that taught in 6th grade and a priest but nothing worked so I was put back into the class and told to ""jog on"" and was put on Prozac and entered therapy (still both being done today). Here I was diagnosed with depression and aniextyI went into 7th grade and left for boarding school and it was a woeful experience I was separated from my friends and everything was cold just cold is all I remember. I left the boarding school at Christmas and things seemed better 8th grade came and around September I had my first experience with suicide by cutting my wrists things got worse I gained weight,had no confidence and never left the house it was just awful and I tried to take my life many times by the end of 8th grade I will always remember sitting on the trainwith two guys that I didn't really now asking if I was going to a night out  and I just said no because I didn't have a ticket but the thing was I did but nobody wanted me. That summer I shaved my head for a charity and I went into another downward spiral I received abuse on the street and was all alone and suicidal not two things you want in your life By 9th grade I began to realise that it doesn't matter how high you are up in the social ladder but as long as you have friends it's ok so I went to a lower group. I began to go out with new people while in school I stuck with a new group of friends  and I went out more talked to girls everything I ever wanted and then got a girlfriend ....We had booted one guy from our group in January because he went behind another guys back and did what I hate which is try to leave your friends. Then my girlfriend and I broke up in April which was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I found help in her friend  who was my guardian angel but I could never honestly tell I loved her like Romeo loved Juliet. I then finished my exams  and started to hang around with new friends  which was an amazing experience but then I went to a house party two weeks after a night out and I started to chat up the girl who hosted the party  while I was in Greece and when I went out I asked to meet up with me and we made out much to her saying we didn't. Then I got the I see you as a friend text which I didn't mind but what she did after was awful she saw me in town and laughed and pointed at me and I went home to cut again.....July got worse, one of my Grans friends which I was very close to died and it broke my soul into pieces. August rolled in and this is where shit really hit the fan turns out for me making out with his ex a lad from a really rough area wanted to fight and then aniexty showed it's ugly head again and the panic attacks again. I planned to go to a back to school event but me and a few of the lads bailed so we stayed at my house here I heard the most awful news of my life, one of my friends made out with my ex and I had a breakdown in front of my friends at 3 in the morning it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced it was just soul crushing. Then I went out to a girl I thought I could get closer to, to have a chat about things and she bailed on me for her friends so I went home to cut my wrists again because I honestly think I'm not good enough for anybody  School has started back up and I'm in 10th grade now and a few weeks back I met up with a girl I've had my eye on for a while and I've fallen hard for her I didn't care about her face or all that it was her mind that got me. I was gonna persist with her but she's been dry as the Sahara and just being a bitch so I'm 100% sure now I'm gonna die alone. I've had a breakdown,2 panic attacks and my cousin died from suicide,she hung herself and she was 29 and had a 6 year old girl and was single mum.But this week has just been awful for me so Wednesday night was a large night out from where I'm from so naturally me and my friends has some alcohol before and we got really drunk so we got  into the club and I said hi to everyone but then I saw my ex and I just erupted I screamed ""YOU'VE DRIVEN ME TO SUICIDE I HATE YOU SO MUCH I HOPE YOU DIE IM GONNA KNOCK OUT YOUR LITTLE BUCK TOOTH BROTHER"" and I got kicked out of the club after 10 minutes and outside I was held down by bouncers to calm down but as soon as they had their backs turned I ran out in front of a car but I was held back by 5 lads from the estate down the road missing the car by 2 metres. It also turns out that I told the girl i had fallen hard for that was a stuck up pompous bitch and just for the record I'm ashamed of what I did So I ask you a question is life worth living for me or should I end it all? "
I do not know if I want to live anymore,"I'm not a very depressed person but the pleasures of life doesn't seem worth the pain anymore. I have a speech impediment (stuttering) and it makes me overthink every single scenario that I encounter, even as simple as buying something from a nearby store. I have so much in my head but what what comes out of my mouth is next to nothing (maybe 1-2%). So many people take fluent speech for granted. They don't realize that it's a boon and abuse it like crazy. Every word that comes out of my mouth is counted and overanalyzed. I'm not an introverted person by nature but this impediment forced me to live a life of seclusion. When I see people of my age going to parties and having fun with their friends, I think to myself that I can do that so much better than them if only I was blessed with a fluent speech. I have tried countless speech therapies but nothing seems to work, looks like this shit is permanent. I can't tell stories, I can't be funny, I can't have anything more than a small talk with anyone even if my head is exploding with jokes and ideas. I have a few friends I'm too scared to meet their friends and family, cause I know that I'll stutter and end up embarrassing the people I hold so dear. Also being overly sensitive isn't helping either. As a male, being overly sensitive somehow prevents you from the respect you deserve from the society. People (even my friends) keep forgetting me, sometimes I feel like that I don't even exist and frankly I don't blame them for that. After all how can you remember some ugly ass dude who can't even speak?! As a child I didn't care much about all this, I was less exposed to the world but as I am growing up this shit is starting to get to me. The only reason why I'm trying to hold on to this pathetic life, is my mom. After losing her husband 5 years ago to multiple myeloma (blood cancer) she can't afford to lose another loved one. Sometimes I think, what did she do to get a poor life like that (death of her husband, a stuttering kid) but somehow I see her smiling every second, and I don't want to be the one to take that smile away. I have made countless mistakes in my life but I do not want to make this grave one. I know suicide is not the answer and it's just running away but frankly I don't care anymore. I'm trying to hold on for the sake of mom but this shit is getting out of hand and I might snap any day now. There are zero sources of happiness and infinite sources of pain. I don't know if I want to live anymore. Please forgive me for my bad grammar, I'm not a native English speaker. I'm sorry for making an excuse. I'm sorry for being a failure. I'm so sorry for existing. "
I feel ready to die,"I don't feel like I have anything to live for. Mental and physical illness has left me unable to succeed academically, I lack the confidence or strength to come out and transition, my closest friends abandoned me because I wasn't fun any more on account of being so depressed, and now I'm just stuck with no-one caring about me and no hope of accomplishing anything or finding love. I'm just a burden on my parents, stuck supporting their loser offspring who should be independent by now. I just don't see anything left to stay alive for. I just want people to tell me it's OK for me to go, to tell me that I'm not a piece of shit for wanting to take the easy way out."
when you try your best but youre still a useless piece of garbage that nobody will ever care about. _���_���,"Hey, man. I care about you. I know that might not seem like much, coming from an internet stranger, but there's a living, breathing, dude over here typing this out to you. I care about you.And I know how hard it can get. I'm struggling to find work, I'm going to be a dad in a few months, and I can't even take care of my family. But I keep pushing myself forward. The hard days seem to be more frequent than the good ones lately, but we keep going forward. We have to. If we stop here, we never get to the good times that make it all worth it. "
Hit me like a wave,"I don't know why but I feel like absolute crap.
I was fine yesterday, why not now? Maybe it's because they ditched me, lied like always.""I keep dragging around whats bringing me down, if I just let go I'd be set free"""
Don't know how much longer I can take being me,"Everybody always tells you you're the source of all your problems.  Well it's definitely true for me. I'm gay. I have herpes. I have no boyfriend. I'm fat. I had my identity stolen. I have a warrant out for my arrest. I hate working. I don't have anybody I can connect with. I think about suicide everyday. I'm emotional. I'm tired. I always want to sleep. I wasted my teen years trying to be a good Mormon.   I just hate being alive, caring about people, not caring about people, always fuck something up, get bored easily.  I just don't know what I can get out of life anymore same shit everyday, always feel like a piece of shit. Wanting to end it everyday multiple times a day, but being to worthless to go through with it. Like fuck funerals and end of life shit cost thousands of dollars and all my death would do would cause my parents more fucking problems from me. "
I lost the last reason that kept me in this world.,"Tonight I will die. The last reason to fight disappeared and now I am not going to keep fighting, I am not going to get help take advise. I don't know why I post it here but I am going to kill myself"
should i live anymore :(,i have no life my mom hates my guts she hits me almost all the time and i just cant stop thinking of suicide everytime i get sad plz help :(
Doing it soon,"I'm so done with everything. I am a worthless single man in his 20s who is still a virgin, I barely have friends and even my friends don't know my true self. My parents constantly remind me of how bad I am by pressuring me into giving up my hobbies so I can get better grades in college (dont have a better world in english for this school in my country). And I am so done. The bullying in my past still haunts me and I have zero self worth. So goodbye bullies, hope you're happy once you learn that I killed myself. "
"I don't feel like it will end for me, and I'm scared.","I'm an early twenties woman, and I'm so afraid all of the time.I have no job despite having a small diploma, I can't find one in any line of work except commission pay which I cannot take. I have anxiety which causes me a lot of fear and grief every day. I ruined my mother's life being born, because she could have been so much more if she didn't have me at a young age. I am currently being tested to see if I have lymphoma, and I know if I do I won't be able to survive chemo, I watched a family member go through it and I am not strong enough. I'm just so scared all the time. I don't want to be afraid and feel worthless like this. I just wish I didn't have to be here. I don't want to unload this on my mother or my few friends, I have done that enough as it is. My father doesn't love me, he never has. He victim shamed me for my rape when I was a young teen recently and it has opened a wound that, on top of everything else,  I don't feel like I can handle. I just really wanted to talk in some way, because holding all of this inside is making me hurt so much. "
Would a 4 story drop be enough to kill someone?,depends how ya land i guess if you do it wrong you will wish you hadn't
Good bye,"I�۪m done. My wife just left, I had packed up all my clothes back into my car. The kids are still asleep. I just took about a dozen or so pain pills, and just shredded my arm up.I�۪m going to pass out in my chair soon. Hopefully when they find me, I�۪ll be gone.Good bye"
Tonight's the big night!,"Got three tubes of Bromazepam (Lexomil), lots of red wine and absolutely no fucking will to live left!I have no family except an abusive mom. My boyfriend is lovely but he just postponed my visit at his. I only have one friend and I can't help but feel awfully jealous of her life. Stopped therapy a while back, my meds don't really help and just make me want to kill myself more. Thought of this so many times, tonight's the night."
I've started to plan,I never thought I'd get up to this point...
My 19th birthday,"Today is my 19 birthday.. I survived 19 years of my life, battling suicide attempts and self harming :) Thank you for helping me to achieve this!"
Can barely get out of bed in 8 months..,"Why would I continue my ""life""? If all I have to do in the future is work for survival, and barely have the energy to do that, why? Why not just kill myself right now? "
what would the zombie apocalypse be like?,"i mean if you were bitten and had to kill yourself and the bullet didnt go through, would you really feel anything after you turned"
Why do I ruin everything,Cause you think you ruin everything.
I was googling ways to kill myself and I find an article that tells me to have sex to prevent me from killing myself.,"""If you�۪re really looking for ways to kill yourself please stop reading and see a shrink, or get high, or have awesome and meaningless sex,""Just fucking lol. No normie understands what it's like to be incel."
2 years.,"If after then I'm still living like this, I will allow myself the freedom to end it. Likely nothing will change and I will end up offing myself in 2 years. But I'll give the universe a chance--out of some vestige of faith?--no, but because I acknowledge I am not seeing clearly. I haven't been for over 2 years now. But it would be unacceptable for this to become my new normal. I'm giving myself 2 years."
It hurts more then anything ive been through and ive been through some shit.,I broke up with the only person ive remembered loving in 17 years and it hurt boys she doesn't want me anymore and it feels like everything is coming to an end i need some help. Please.
How my depression started. I know some of you have it worse than me. Forgive me for ranting. Just wanna share.,"The first thing that comes to mind when SELF-HARM is mentioned, is cutting. No, in my case -well, it's just a theory- that the reason why i don't cut myself, even though i have the urge, is because i don't like scars. I don't want to give anyone an evidence or even an idea that im c-r-a-z-y. (People with mental illness isn't crazy, but normal people in general view it as that)  I even considered cutting myself in places people won't see. But still, it's my skin. What if my future husband sees it. My bestfriends? (If i'll ever have one) What would they think? You could say i was raised by parents who always reminds me to check my manners infront of everyone, to be decent, and not give them any reason to judge us but nice, warm and kind. The opposite happened though, i did all of that, i did my duties as a good child. Though, i have relapses and acted liked a spoiled brat infront of others because i know that would unnerve my parents. I'd been kind once. Perfect manners, nice and endearingly shy.
But Life happened to me, and finally saw that the world is messed up. No matter how nice i try to be with everyone, they would always find ways to disappoint me and throw away my trust and acted like im nothing to them. People. Maybe thats why im adapting to their behavior. I absorbed it and put it into practice. So imagine, all those F up people i met in all my 16 years of life, combined, compressed into one 5 foot tall girl. All the attitude they throw at me, came back to them. Their attitude i hated the most, took it, and put it to practice. Maybe to take revenge to the world, to other people. I want them to also see what i saw. Experience what i felt. I want them to feel awful as much as how they made me feel. How could they do something like that? Maybe its normal, maybe i can do that too. That its fine to be a douchebag like everyone else.
Okay, that suddenly went far from the topic. So, as i was saying, i dont cut myself because i don't want evidences. If i don't cut myself, how do i release all these emotions? Maybe, just a theory, i unconsciously took the alternative. To harm myself mentally, so i could feel something other than numb.
 To hate and be hated.
Im a girl who always receive praise from my family, teachers and peers. In school, you could say im competitive. Not smart but hardworking enough. My life revolves around making high grades, competing scores. So maybe that's why i fucked it all up. Too much pressure, to much expectations. It was satisfying when everyone face fell when my grades drop. At first i was kinda sad about my grades. But they kind of deserved it. That's why i always raise their expectations then suddenly drop it hard at their faces. I want them to know and see that they all F me up and they're the reason of all this.[I saw this on my diary (an old entry),and wanted to show it with u guys]Am i immature? Taking revenge to the world by making myself miserable. All your trusted friends stabbing you in the back, bullying you all of the sudden and making you miserable for the whole school year. But even worse, i still hold on to it. The pain they caused me.  At the time i have no one to turn to. Almost everyone would make fun of me. Calling me names, treating me like trash.
What really hurts the most is they were my friends, they made me feel horrible. They changed the way i view people.
(5 years have already passed)
It started off like that for me, but as time goes on, it got worse. Now, theres no anger left and just disappointed in myself. For ruining myself for them. Just an empty shell, can't even function like a human being. Anti-social, no life, locked on my room reading books. And my parents calling me crazy for not going out, and acting all 'EMO'. They look at me like im Mad. "
"Going off to college was supposed to help me. Be a fresh start. But here I am again, crying in bed wishing I could work up the courage to down a bottle of pills",Could you be overwhelmed? Is a break a possibility or dropping certain classes?
The dumbest question in the world!,Why does everyone everywhere everyday ask the same dumb question that they don't ever want the real answer too?HOW ARE YOU?
I can't deal with this anymore.,"Not going into any detail. I'm tired of just being put off as being ""disrespectful"". I'm just angry. No one will notice, and when I do say something everyone ignores it.
They used to think I was just joking about it, I asked old friends and they thought it too. Even when I try to make it as serious as can be they still ignore it all."
Just wanted to say thanks,Every time I get a comment on here it warms my heart. Thank you guys for always being so kind and supportive. You're all awesome people! :D
I'm done bye,"This stupid cycle just keeps going and going and I can't do it anymore. It's draining my life away and I've aged at least ten years every time this happens. I meet someone and they're now my soulmate and I must devote everything to them and expect so much in return and then get nothing and I waste so much time on this. I thought I was better than this. I have been through the hospitals and the therapy and everything and I just can't break this. I want it to end so I'm ending it. Whoever reads this, thanks I guess. If it's my friends/family, then I guess I'm sorry. I just can't keep doing this. It's all I'll ever be and I can't let it be this way. I just need it to stop. I'm sorry. Goodbye."
Morning.,"This morning was tough. I thought about all my farewells but no desire to truly reach out. Waking up on the weekends are the toughest. Work keeps me pretending to be normal M-F. My children, the man I love, they used to be a reason to stay but the hurt in my heart is deep.I chose life again today. Even if I feel like I'm dying."
I wish I had jumped 133 days ago when I had the strength,"Yes, I've been keeping count. It was May 7th, 2017 that I decided that I was nothing more than a hazard to society, and that I was gonna end my life by jumping off the bridge near my house. But my friends called the police. 7 days later, I was out of the psych ward. The bridge is always still there, but on that day I couldn't fear death less. Now? Not so much. Typical cowardice. And before you get your sympathy up and going, I'm not the type of person you guys can relate to. I didn't have problems at school. I didn't have troubles at home. I have a good circle of friends, some of whom are ""actually depressed,"" and the only reason my lovely girlfriend left me was because of my ""issues"" (more on that in a second). Even my work wasn't that bad, before I got fired for missing shifts. Sure the docs diagnosed me with MDD, but I think that's bullshit. I don't even have real depression. The only reason I even have ""depressed episodes,"" and the reason I need to kill myself in the first place, is because I have anger issues. That's right guys, I'm so pathetic that I can't even control my emotions enough to make my life worth living. Literally all it is is that I'll get angry about something(s), I'll try to hold it in like a normal person, it'll explode out because I'm too weak and fuck shit up, and I'll beat me up for being the piece of shit monster that can't control my emotions who's only role in the world is lashing out at people in rage like some sort of tool of God's wrath that should just kill himself before he fucks even more shit up. That's my ""depression."" Even just thinking about my anger issues makes me feel ""depressed."" I know, what a joke. And like I said, they diagnosed me and even prescribed me some drugs, but I haven't even been picking them up. People with actual mental problems need those, not some jackass like me. Besides, even if they ""lift my mood,"" someone like me doesn't even deserve help. Justice is punishing those who do wrong. That's why I only ever post about my problems online, instead of talking about them in the real world where people will force me to get the help that I don't deserve. I probably should have posted this to  instead, but since it deals with suicide talk, they'd probably prefer it here. Just remember guys, no matter how worthless you feel, you'll never be as much of a joke as this guy. Hopefully that helps you a little bit, but maybe not. Dammit, I really should just go jump right now. I just read back through everything I wrote. This is just fucking pathetic. If anything, I should go jump to save what little honor I have left. "
College dud. Waste of life.,"I thought I did phenomenally on an exam last week. The material was simple. I had it all laid out. It was only like ten multiple choice with about 15 fill in the blank questions. I got close to an F even though on exam day I walked out in full utter confidence that I got nothing less than a B+.Now I got a D on my lab report. I did everything necessary except forgot to do one easy calculation. I lost 6 points and that one calculation could not have been worth that much. It was basic addition and dividing!! An average! This was not the purpose of the lab either. My professors haven't responded to my emails. I want to give up. I want to get my degree and leave my future behind. Another wasted semester.I am feeling very suicidal and hurt. I take responsibility for my faults but I'm in shock that I had this many.I have an exam tomorrow. Another on Friday for a class I don't understand. I'm sure. If I drop it all then I will let my work, fam, coworkers and my SO down."
"injury took my friends + wife, nothing to live for","My wife is 9 years, my highschool sweetheart and love of my life is leaving me because I've become sad and miserable from an injury that gives me pain causing me discomfort and inabiliuty to work etc Shes watching life pass me by and she doesnt want it to pass her by, I cant really blame her. I want to kill myself though. My life sucks and one by one my friends and loved ones drop away and beacayuse I dont make bank or have big muscles and a nice car, it seems like everybody looks me over.I did steroids a few months back and everyone treated me totally differently when my body was big, but now I get the same disappointed sad looks.I'm going to try steroids once again and if that doesnt make my life happy I'll just kill myself.Hell im thinking of just doing it right now, I called the suicide hotline twice as my ""friend"" and they told my ""friend"" to go to the ER immediately... I didnt go. I just talked to my girl.
She said even if I was super successful and had it all, we wouldnt get back together. It crushed me. I was doing life for me, but secretly holding out hope she would come back once I got successful.. now it hit me shell probaly be taken by the next white dude with a bachelors and I'll lose her forever... I only lost her bcause of this fucking injury.The injury I got because of her basically cause she took my white ass to her asian rave party and I got handed free ecstasy and popped that shit, rolled my head around too hard and thats when the pain started. Now shes leaving, cause she just says she isnt responsible for my happiness only her own and its not her problemAll my friends are gone my mom died and my dad is so old hes just a grumpy old man I cant even talk to him now. Dabs are the only thing keeping my sane. Not to mention a million other problems I have. On the edge here... I want to hold on but life just wants me to kill myself and stop bothering everyone already."
Any survivors with advice?,"My question is for people who have suffered from chronic suicidal ideation: how did you find the will to live again? How did you permanently change those negative thought patterns or at least stop believing them?Like many of the people who post here I am currently in a fragile state. However, I feel that I am at the brink of making a change. Part of me is scared to commit to life again in fear of failing and in fear of the pain that will come.Regardless, I am tired of suffering. This is not a healthy way to live and I know that I will hurt people more by committing suicide. Still I get caught up in the meaninglessness of it all.I am feeling a bit sick and worried. Something in me wants desperately to be consumed by fear again and to live and die in this state. The other small, quiet voice within me wants to break out of it into the unknown that is full of potential.How can I trust that voice when it feels so wrong? When I feel so afraid? When I feel so alone?How do I find the part of me that  to move forward?I'm afraid.It's embarrassing to admit, but I'm really afraid... I'm not necessarily looking for advice because I've heard all the general basics. I'm looking for courage.Everything in my body is telling me not to venture out... to stay where everything is comfortable, but sad... misery...I am tired of living in addiction.It surrounds me.Even if I can't escape it in the people around me I no longer want it to consume me. I don't want it to permeate my skin and swim through my veins at any chance it gets.I'm terrified of ""getting better"" because I have no idea what that looks like for me and I am afraid of truly feeling again. I don't know how to protect myself from the world. Maybe I do, but I don't quite trust myself yet.Even as I type this I feel reality slipping away from me... my mind is dissociating... and I don't understand why it does this, even at times like now, when I should feel safe and I want to feel confident and free...It makes me feel like maybe I shouldn't be..."
Tonight's The Night,"I've got twice the minimum lethal dosage of pills, a nice razor blade, and I'm planning to take a nice trip to an overpass in the middle of the night. Love you"
I feel unwanted.,Nobody wants me around no matter how good I am. There's always something wrong with me. And when I get hurt it's still my fault. I get ignored or bitched at for no reason. I wish I were dead.
"I'm a terrible piece of shit, I don't know if I can fix this...","Hey, so I feel terrible me and my friend had an huge argument yesterday on Discord and he was already enough pain, and couldn't take it anymore, I made things worse and I've known him for 3 years. We got really close last year, related on so many things and I pushed him away. I didn't get over an incident that happened 4-5 months ago and I was petty between my ex-friend, who he's friends with. It's fine that he defends him, cause things definitely way got out of hand. He doesn't deserve all this pain, I feel so terrible. I really don't know how to write a sincere apology. I related to him so well, that I even harsh a bit. I really want to apologize, but I don't know how to word it.I found out he's in this discord group chat, but scared that he will get mad at me. Please help! I really am on the verge of ruining an amazing friendship. He means a lot to me, he doesn't mind me venting. But, I made things out of hand and caused this to be like this. It is my fault that I did this, I just don't know how to properly fix this. All I do is cause more damage and hurt others. I just really wish there is a good way of fixing this, like what should I say? I don't mind admitting my mistakes, but I feel anxious talking to a person who's also anxious often with social anxiety."
"my best friend is extremely apathetic, asserting she doesn't care. guess that gives me an out...","my best friend has been treating me like shit for the past month and has been getting worse no matter what i say. she's actually told me, literally, ""i'm super busy with school so i don't have the time or energy to deal with your problems and feelings."" i fucking wish i could make that up. i had one good day, my birthday, and the day after, i got in huge trouble with her and she got extremely upset with me and some of the things she told me included:
1. ""you better watch your tone next time. she doesn't know who she's dealing with/talking to but you do.""
2. ""...since i seem to be inconviencing you with my impatience just do it this way since you said that.""
3. I was supposed to visit for my birthday but i was unable to because circumstances changed and she didn't care. ""if you come up here, then great we can see the movie. if not then okay. you can just mail the stuff to my p.o. box""
ever since she left for school, she's been more hostile and it's been breaking me day by day. she can upsate me for 30 minutes straight before her next class and i dont even have to say anything...she has her own mental health problems and in the past has grown up to detach herself from emotion but in the past, she at least showed she cared a little. she gave up on me a while ago. stopped trying to help when i called her before my attempts when i just needed someone to talk to for a moment. (she told me she didn't have a reason to because i was going to try anyway). i tried... and i got close once but... i'm still here so. just a month ago, everything was perfect, we were okay and nothing was like this. now, i'm nothing to her. she hasn't talked to me in about 2 days but she uses all of my stuff because she has my passwords. she ignored my last message purposefully and has posted on literally everything and has even seen my posts on social medias and yet still decided not to even deal with me. she talks to her ""friends"" that have known her for 3 weeks over the friend that has been with her for 10 years. i'm tired of living and watching myself go through this pain again is just a reminder that she won't actually care when i finally succeed. she won't cry. it won't matter. she has her /boyfriend/ and her new friends. and i don't have anyone. i have my fucked up mental health. and disorders. and a emptiness in my chest that wont go away. my own voice in my head reminding me that i deserve to die because even this situation is childish. she knows all of my disorders and health problems and she literally doesn't care. holds stuff over my head. there's no hope. i genuinely just want to die. give up. not like i've got a reason to even do more.she can keep everything. my accounts. keep using all of my stuff. i don't even want it anymore. i don't want anything. i just want to fucking die. "
How to get out of this always recurring black thoughts,"Hi everyone. I am really kind of desperate so i am writing here something. As i'm not native english speaker, sry about all grammar mistakes and hopefully you will still understand what i mean. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Has to do with some family issues. I can't remember a time without depressive phases. When is was 17 years old, it was the first time i really wanted to die. I mean, i thought about suicide the years before. But that time, i really wanted to. I can remember, that some weeks before i started to feel nothing. Not even when i cut myself and these had been the worst cuttings ever since i started with it whe n i was 12. At one point I felt so tired. Tired of all the pain. Tired of all the selfhatred. Tired of feeling anything. So I prepared to shoot myself. But somehow, as i had the gun already put in my mouth, there was something screaming in me, like: ""don't do it!"". I think that was the so called self preservation. So i searched a therapiest, got some medicaments and life went on. More or less it was okay. I could handle the recurring depression. But 2 years ago, with almost 24 it started again. The depression phase just didn't end. After a half year, i took a break for 2 months in a daytime psychiatric. I came back to work and three weeks later i tried to commit suicide again and woke up in the hospital. Three days later i was back to work. In the beginning of 2017 there happened some things at work..at privat life. I just couldn't regain back some power... friends can't take my dark thought and depression anymore. Instead of losing them, i pretend since a half a year that everything is fine. One guy, my co worker, grew then very close to me. We had an affair. He told me he will be there. I told him everything. I didnt do that for a long time..maybe never. I felt so secure with him. But it was complicated as well. Because he was already in a long term relationship (yeah, maybe everything that happened by now is bad karma because i deserve). So few weeks ago his girlfriend started to feel suspicious. He stopped the affair. That was really hard but he still told me he has feelings and that he wanted to me be part im his life as a true friend. This was enough. It was okay. Today he wrote me that not even a friendship is possible anymore. He doesnt feel anything for me. As co workers we have to go on and he wants to have a good time at work with me. But there cant be a true friendship. It devasted me. I stayed home. I know, i may deserve it. I did mistakes. But i feel so alone, devasted, empty and a huge selfhatred. He was the only one who really knew about me and who i thought could handle me. But he can't either. No one can. I feel like a big failure.. no one can stay with me. I have no power to fight everything anymore...i turn soon 26 and i fought my whole life but what if this is going on and on? what if i'm a failure? I really am miserable...Does someone suffer this long too and can tell me that at one point everything went well? What should i do? I am alone again... i cant fight this all over alone again...."
Not a functional human being,"Have you ever experience being extremely depressed to the point that you can't function like a normal human being. Like im supposed to go to school but i'd rather lie down in bed.I've got a test coming up, i need to review but im still lying here in bed. You're internally panicking, guilty and feel really bad for not doing the things you need to do. But you lie down anyway. Sometimes you forgot to eat, and lose track of time/days."
I dont know what to title,"I don't really have anyone to go to here, so I figured fuck it all, Ill put this out there and then maybe someone random can help. I don't really care at this point.I am 18, just about to start college, and something is not right with me.I literally have the worst anxiety about the future. I know I will fail, just based on the past. Everything I have done I have either gotten lucky, or just half-assed it just enough to scrape by and it is 100% not an exaggeration when I say this. I fucking hate myself for doing it, but I know that no matter the circumstance, its inevitable that I do the exact same shit that I always say I shouldn't, I just don't care ever and it hurts me, and sometimes the people that I love.I have no sense of direction anymore. Everything just seems worthless to me. There's no future, and even if there was, I know mine would have me end up in a fucking ditch. So here I am, whining to empty air about how I am too lazy to do shit, how I don't know what to do and how I am scared, and I expect sympathy from random people. This fact alone makes me feel like even more of a low life, ""please, take pity on me and drag out my inevitability to amount to nothing."" The irony is that I doubt anyone I know has even the slightest clue about what I am feeling, and I really don't want to change the image that they have of me. I am ready to just go off.Tonight makes the 3rd day of a string of suicidal considerations. I so fucking scared either way, it goes to show how useless I really am if I cant even make the decision to make the most selfish action a reality, even then so to simply consider it. Its a cycle and I keep going down.I know I am being a pussy, but I guess all I can ask is for you to persuade me. Nobody else I know can, because nobody else can know"
Not Again...so sorry this is a long post,"I battle off and on with depression. 3 attempts and one revival in 2012. Been ""okay"" since then, but not really. I had a daughter in 2014 and a son in 2015. They are my life. My husband...ugh...he has a way of making me feel less than worthless. For the past year its been shit. He is mean. Heartless. Careless. I am a stay at home mom. I have crohns disease and im on social security. I want to go back to work, even just part time, but he doesnt want me to. I literally have one friend, gay dude named scott, hes my rock. I dont (cant, call it what ya will) have a facebook or any other social media stuff other than reddit. I cant talk to my husband about anything. When he gets mad, he is fucking satan. Example--my 3 year old daughter is smart. My husband and i got into a huge fight, he kicked me out as usual, wouldnt let me come home and i slept in my sisters car, this was all friday night by the way. He was wasted. Saturday morning comes, he texts me, you can come home the door is unlocked now. I walk in, and my son is still asleep but my 3 year old comes skipping on up to me. Im obviously happy to see her. I reach down to pick her up and she smiles this big beautiful smile. Then says, youre not my best friend. I died inside immediately. Throughout the day her phrases just got better. I cried all night saturday and most of today. She said daddy doesnt love you and this isnt your house. I have not felt this empty in years and i was hoping i would never have to feel this bad again. He has barely said 2 words to me, acts like nothing ever happened. So sorry for the long rant. But getting it out helps alot. I havent had to see my therapist in awhile but that dude is gettin a call first thing in the morning. "
"Work force, intense workloads , considering taking drugs until my body shuts down completely. Already no call no showed for my job","Instead of killing myself instantly i sort of want my body to shut down after working too hard. People around me are super nosy, they aren't considerate. I get no inheritance, it's taken weeks just to talk to a psychiatrist about a medication I took for 5 years ago.  Someone who isn't even my family or blood is treated better, children that aren't even related to my grandparents will get it all. My father and uncle are 2 felons who don't care if I get anything. They spend it all on junk. I have no future inheritance, I have nothing in my room, I'm a 23 yr old white male. Everyone says man up and grow a pair anytime I start to complain it makes me super angry. Only reason I keep going is for my sister and mother who always loved me, and my current gf who also was going to end it before I met her. She said I stopped her. I have nightmares, I'm sick of cheap talk and continuing on. If I just speed enough I can probably die working. I want to be a example to society on why the energy crisis is so fked up. We have no future way out of our debt we are increasing it another trillion this year. So yeah, 23 year old white male from Ohio. I hate this place, the job I just left smelled like a std in the kitchen. Like literal sperm smell all over the floors. The bathrooms were absolutely filthy at all times. I feel even if I get out of this abusive trap house, I'd be stuck with a dead end apartment lease for years and my job would fuck me over anyways. If I get sick or weak I just won't cut it. It's as simple as that.  McDonald's already gave me 2 jobs at different locations. But I want a real career, everyday is a evil one and I'm ready to end it producing money for my mother and sister. They worry about me everyday but the person they knew is gone. I'm no longer innocent and young and this world only caters to soulless bastards who don't care about people. I'm not one of them. I'm to considerate and I'm a yes man. Hard work doesn't pay off for me it detriments my health. Even without drugs I can work until I'm dead. I was almost coughing up blood when I got home. What should I do ? My psychiatrist appointment is the 21st and everyday seems to drag on and I'm invaded with people in and out of this god forsaken house for no reason other than to wake me up. I can't even sleep anymore without disturbances. How am I ungrateful when I have no future wealth ahead of me ? How am I ungrateful when hard work never pays off ? "
thinking about suicide,how many fluoxetine would it take to kill someone around 130 pounds
MY ONLINE FRIEND IS TRYING TO O.D.,Can anyone locate tumblr user Arthursbasement ???? She lives in California and she posted about committing suicide and I am messaging her but she stopped replying and she said she already took the pills!!!
I cant cope with my life anymore. I just want to die,Anxiety and depression have taken over every aspect of my daily life. I cant control it anymore. Everyday suicide starts to make more sense. Im sick of crying myself to sleep every night. Im sick of thinking my friends constantly hate me when i know they dont. Im sick of not eating. Im sick of being tired all the time. Im sick of having parents who refuse to talk to me about these things. I cant enjoy anything anymore. I cant remember the last time i was truly happy. I dont want to live like this anymore. I just cant do this anymore. I feel so fucking lonely.I just want to die.
I've run out of reasons to care about anything anymore.,"I can never numb the pain with drugs and alcohol for the rest of my life, but that's just prolonging the inevitable, while making me suffer this absurd existence even longer. I feel like everything I've ever done has been leading up to this, the time when I finally get the courage to end this shitty life and move on to whatever's after, which is probably nothing, but maybe it not being nothing is an even scarier thought. I am broken beyond repair, there is no hope for someone like me. I don't want to hurt anyone by doing this, but honestly once I'm dead it won't make any difference to me. Maybe that makes me selfish or something, but I don't give a fuck. I love my parents, and my best friends, but being tortured by my own mind until I die of old age just isn't going to happen. I don't know why I'm writing this, but here it is anyways I guess. Goodbye maybe"
suicide,i had a virtual friend who comitted suicide and i don't know how to deal with that even thought i never met her in person or saw her face but i feel so hurted.. it was like i met her years ago
I NEED A THERAPIST,pretty much the title. My mind is not right and hasn't been for the past five years.
I feel like I'm standing on an edge,"Recently, I've drastically cut down my marijuana usage, from every day to once or twice a week. For the 5 or 6 days I'm sober its spent stressing to keep up a professional persona at work. every goal I try to look forward to sounds uninviting, and the days I do smoke make me happy, but then I overthink, criticize myself, and become deeply introspective and sad. There is so much of me that needs to be fixed and its apparent. I found someone who at least cares and shows me beauty in life, but I worry so often that my depression will ruin us. We have a connection that I know is rare. I cant ruin us. I wonder if the increasingly stressful days will lead to growth or death. "
Homework or Life?,"I'm a psychopath
i would rather die than do my homework,or any work at all.
I feel like more than half of my life i'm doing what i hate do to,the other 10% of my life is doing what i like to do.I really hate highschool,i hate how life is just pure pain.
You want to be happy? NOPE
You will have to go trough depression,to fake your happiness so that everyone doesen't judge you or exclude you,and to hide your suicidal thoughts from your parents,because you love them and don't want them to feel bad.I'm not impressed about dying,i'm also an atheist, and the idea of nothing at all for forever sounds great to me.
I really don't think that suicide is a big deal,is just that people consider death a bad thing because we only know life,but at this point anything would be better than living.
I'm not suicidal because i hate myself or because someone bullied me, i'm suicidal because i realized that life always strikes you down,and sometimes you just want to stay on the ground without having to get up again.
And, if our science is right, we are just microscopic specs living in a giant floating rock in space,surrounded by nothingness and a big giant star that's going to eat our stupid planet in a few million years i believe, so that doesn't help.
Everything you think is important isn't,because in the end nothing matters,when humanity dies,everything we did, good things,bad things,global warming and so on will disappear,and nothing will be worth it.I would have already committed suicide if it wasn't for two things:
-My parents,i love them and i just can't imagine how much it would hurt them
-Pain, i'm really obsessed with pain,and i just really want to go to sleep and never wake up,to remove all my problems,my homework,my sadness and my daily existencial crisis.I'm sorry i just wanted to get that out of my sistem,any advice on what to do now?"
life: how it feels!,"life: "" look!! she's a happy girl let's fuck her and makes her depressed"""
I'm about to force myself to end my life,"First of all I'm SICK AND TIRED of people saying oh others have it worse Blah blah because at this point I don't give a fuck about others it's driving me insane that I can't ask for help because that's all I hear I'm going crazy dealing with all my stress I'm always on the edge of killing someone or just breaking down I have a boyfriend I don't bring up how I feel because when I'm with him I forget everything I don't want him to think ""you're crazy"" or ""what a weirdo"" and act like he loves me all I want is to die I can't stand it I don't care anymore I can't take it anymore why am I so hated by everyone why do so little people like me why can I not feel normal I don't want to hurt him but it's killing me I can't take it and Alex if you ever find this then I'm so damn sorry I really am I love you but I can't take it I'm going insane I'm so sorry"
How exactly can a suicide hotline help you?,"I've been on the verge of suicide and have been thinking about calling one a number of times. Do they just say bullshit like ""you have so much to life for"" and follow a script? I honestly can't see them talking anyone out of suicide."
My mental health is making me suicidal,"I suffer from sexual intrusive thoughts (OCD), anxiety and depression. I'm desperate to die and when the intrusive thoughts aren't there I'm thinking about all the different ways I can kill myself. I haven't eaten or drank properly in days and I now plan to die from either starvation or dehydration but the only problem is I don't want to leave my boyfriend heartbroken. He means everything to me and we used to talk about getting married and having a family. I want to live for him but it's too painful and I don't know what to do"
My Once Promising Life Is Now A Painful Living Hell - Botched Dental Work Trauma,"Early 30s female here, quietly gearing up to end things in the somewhat near future.  Possibly.  Probably.  Kind of at the stage where I'm amping myself up for it, mentally preparing and forming preliminary plans.  Honestly, it could be several months away if I can endure that long.  Getting through each day has gotten very hard though.  I truly want an outcome where I can live, but the constant discomfort I feel makes me think euthanasia has to be on the table, at least as a consideration.  Just wanted to vent, maybe find some like-minded friends grappling with their own stuff.  I don't have the typical reasons I think most people have for doing this.  I have high self-esteem and feel good about myself, I feel I am attractive, intelligent, talented.  For most of my life I have been pretty resilient in the face of challenges, of which I've had many.  I have tons of interests in life and goals.  I loved being alive before this happened... eating, music, writing, art, animals, being around people...all that life entails.  I'm a very empathic, kind person, which hopefully doesn't sound arrogant to say, but I do feel like I have a lot of good to contribute to this world.  I have a fairly rewarding and intriguing job where I work with some less fortunate people.  I am a little isolated in my personal life, but I have a couple of close relationships that keep me going.  My point is that other than this, I had reasons to live.If my suicide occurs, it will be 100% because I could not cope with the way I was injured or the ensuing pain.  I literally don't have any other reason in my life that would cause me to take such drastic action right now.  I can live with being poor, I can live with isolation, I can live with a lot of things.  But I can't accept never being physically comfortable again.  Not like this.     Burning facial and dental pain is a constant reminder of the senseless mistakes that I've suffered through, and it's driven me insane.  Aggressive and unnessary dental work with an incompetent, money grubbing dentist followed by miscommunications with another ended up completely botching my teeth, ending with someone deeply shaving into them to adjust my bite when I didn't consent to such measures. This caused me massive pain and bite problems way worse than the minor complaints I went in with.  It's a long story, but I basically started out with zero problems and went on this insane ride that ended in me being so botched and traumatized.  Just a perfect storm of terrible luck.  I was subject to unnecessary procedures, then to correct those, I was subject to another invasive one that was the final nail in the coffin.  I basically got scammed into work I didn't want, leaving me with exposed nerves, worn back teeth, a constant burning in my teeth and face, and a newfound death wish if this is what my life is to be.  I'm looking at suing the more recent of the two dentists who did the most devastating work, but these cases are really hard to fight.  The crux of my case is that I had actually asked this dentist in our consult for the opposite of what was done and did not consent to what actually happened.  He was supposed to build some slightly worn teeth back up as we discussed in our consult, but decided on his own to adjust my bite using a reductive approach instead, destroying healthy dentition by reshaping my teeth with a power tool when I came to our next appointment.  I've later learned this procedure is actually very controversial and has caused other people a lot of problems, too.  It's barbaric and probably will go the way of mercury fillings and be phased out of dentistry in the next decade or two, some bite specialists already refuse to do it anymore but they are very rare.  It's called an occlusal equilibration.  The fact that I had this inflicted on me makes me feel so violated.  I never, ever would have agreed to what was done to me had it been discussed beforehand, and it's just left me in horrendous anguish.  Imagine if you went in for one procedure you had discussed with someone but received the opposite that you didn't need, how insane that would make you.  Especially when you have complications and find it's surprisingly difficult and expensive to fix.  I went from being a normal, basically healthy young woman to needing major prosthetic work done on all my back teeth so fast, thanks to the handiwork of these charlatans.  It hurts so much all the time.  I don't know if I can live in this marred body anymore, even if the rest of it is still in good shape, this is too destructive and painful to heal from.  Now I'm in this terrifying position of needing advanced dentistry to restore my quality of life.  Nothing else is going to address the pain.  Someone has to go in who really knows what they're doing and cover up all of the exposed nerve endings with composite or onlays and hope there wasn't nerve damage.If you knew me, you'd appreciate how ironic this is...I battled depression when I was much younger, and actually beat it for many years.  I formed an outlook that kept me very content in life.  A strong foundation.  No matter what happened to me I was good, because I felt good, I was healthy, I felt good inside my own skin, I could endure any challenges.  I chose to be happy and not to suffer.  This worked for many years, the positive mindset I developed for myself.  It would've lasted a lifetime I think, were it not for this one crazy thing.  This is like the one thing in the whole world that could have taken me to this place.  In an extremely unlucky series of events, I was injured by a medical professional, and this injury torments me...the way it transpired, how it feels, how profoundly unlucky I am.  How difficult it will be to repair the damage, if that's even possible.  I should have stopped it, I shouldn't have blindly trusted... I realize now how my previous happiness deeply hinged on my health and physical comfort.  I may never feel normal or ok inside my body again.  I have not been comfortable for several years.  There is a constant burning at the site of the injury that does not let up.  My face is always uncomfortable because my bite is so messed up.  I appear aesthetically normal to others since most of the work was on back teeth,  but I'm in immense pain.  Nothing will ever heal without major intervention.  I just don't think I can accept this life anymore.I wish there was a way I could live, but my mind just won't accept the new reality I am living in.  I'm constantly uncomfortable.  I'm trying to give myself that couple of months, but it's really hard.  Every day is heartbreaking because this is not supposed to be my life.  This is a travesty.  So rare and unlucky, who goes through this?  Now the plan is to travel many states away to see an experienced specialist for my issues.  I'm trying to stay alive to see this through...the specialist seems pretty optimistic about fixing this.  But it is a process that will take several months of costly back and forth travel and procedures.  It will be my last stab at life.  I'm just so devastated, some days I don't even know if I can hold out that long.  What happened, how this all started...it's too unfair to process.  I was recently diagnosed with PTSD as a result of this incident.Is there anyone else on here in their 30s and at their end?  Or anyone else who has a medical/dental issue or mistake that became suicide fuel for them?I don't know how to end my rant...pain is a bitch.  But it's even worse when it you can't stop looking back, knowing it shouldn't have happened, knowing it was so preventable and senseless and just pure bad luck.  Something about this sensation I just cannot take.  It feels so horrible.  I can handle other types of injuries and pain but this is apparently my Achilles heel.  I would trade this in for almost anything else.  I'm not strong enough to deal with this."
Today made me realise that life is nothing special.,"When I was 15 years old, I had the sudden realisation that my life was pointless. I suddenly felt weak and everything that I thought was great about life was all a lie. I began to see behind the curtain and the illusion we are given that life is a wonderful thing and many opportunities await us was all lies and the world did not mean for us to be here. Before I begin to tell you the story of why today made me realise that life is nothing special, I just want to say that I'm 22 years old, I live in Manchester, England, I'm an aspiring film-maker and screenwriter. I'm about to start my final year of university and I currently work at a job that I hate. I have written many screenplays that I'm extremely passionate about, some of them are dramas, some are coming of age stories, some are comedies (because I have to make myself laugh when I'm depressed like this) and the rest are romances! I had friends in high school, I don't really see them anymore as they have moved on to much better things while I'm just sitting here, crawling through this pit known as life. I've tried changing my lifestyle many times, but I always get pulled back into pit of self-hatred and dread. I've attempted suicide four times over the last year alone, I think this is my peak and I personally think that my life is over. Most of my attempts have been done late at night when my parents and brother were asleep. I did this so they couldn't stop me from killing myself and of course, all my attempts failed! That brings us to today, a day which made me realise that life is nothing special, I've always known this, but today was the day that made me reflect that nothing is special and that we are just as messed up. I was on the bus home from work and I was stuck on there for two hours (the bus journey is usually 40 minutes) and it was packed, full of people who were late for work, college or just trying to get home. Everyone looked sad, broken and stressed! Of course, the bus was very late, but for some reason, everyone looked unhappy and life was ruined for them all. There was even a girl who looked about 16 and she had shadows under her eyes and looked like she was done with life and then there was a woman and her husband who looked like they were in their 60s and they looked like they were done with life as well. This made me think that life is just shit and we have been forced to live through it because two selfish human beings decided ""Gee let's have a kid and have them live in this shit world!"" Seeing everyone on this bus remained me that we have been brought up just to do mundane tasks and that life is pointless overall. We are just little parts of a bigger world and we have not reason to be here. All the pleasures of life have been sucked out of them including me and we have been forced to be forever stressed and live our lives in pain and misery. Everyone on this bus looked like they were done with life and it made me realise that I should finally pull the plug and end my life. At this point, I see that everyone in the world wants to end their life and I guess I should go as well. I don't really care that I'll be passing on my depression to my parents, my brother, my extended family and my friends. They will forget about me in a few months and they will move on with their lives before they die (or we decide to blow up the world for some reason) I have posted here many times here and you are probably thinking ""Just end it already, you are just seeking attention, you're an asshole!"" Well, I guess I am, I'm ready to go! My name is Jonathan, I'm 22 years old and like millions of people around the world who are ready to take their lives. I'm ready to go, I'm wish you all a very fond farewell and I hope that somehow, life gets better. I don't know how that will happen, but when it does, I want you to embrace it, whether that be your very first kiss, your first child, or even your new found happiness. Embrace it please, make this world a better place. I know I can't do that, I'm weak and inferior, but I know you can. I'm sorry to everyone who will be affected by my death, I loved you and I hope you to see you again very soon. I love you all!    "
I'm out.,First of all sry for my shitty english its my third language.I have lost all hope. I have not felt happy in a very long time and i feel like its time to leave earth now. My life will never get better so might aswell end it while atleast some people still remember me. I have saved up some money so i have thinking about going somewhere magical to die alone with no return ticket. I feel very psychological unstable at the moment. So going on a trip alone somewhere warm and pieceful alone and enjoying the best of earth before going is a good plan to me. I might only be 21 but my life will never get better now i am sure and i dont want to become a lonely loser i have experienced alot and have had some good times with old friends who i dont see anymore and family. I will be thinking about these good times before leaving & i think my last thoughts will go out to the stars and whatever is out there. Space has always fascinated me so much. Good luck everybody on this ruthless miserable planet. I'm out.
Is it wrong...,"I may or may not be bipolar (weird have some super moments then think about suicide all day other than the happy time). But that is irrelevant. I have a general dissatisfaction with life, with no problems financially or anything, altgough it could be argued I am a little bit lethargic. I have been passively suicide for around a year and decided perhaps its time to not be such a sissy. I am a freshman in HS and have a desire for people to also kill themselves in an effort to prevent them from having kids. Thus, my conclusion was to do something like sepuku during lunch were hundreds would see and increase copycats. Is that wrong of me?"
It would mean a lot if someone saw this. I don't know what to do anymore,I hope someone reads this. I thought I was getting better over the summer. I don't know what happened. I'm a gay male. I went to a school that accepted me for who I am last year. I could finally express myself and be myself. It was the first time I've felt happy in years. Now I'm at a new school and I'm already being made fun of for being gay. A lot of the other guys in my school won't come near me. It's like I have some sort of disease. You know when something that shouldn't bother you anymore comes back up and just (metaphorically) punches you in the stomach. This has been going on for years now and in march it put me in the hospital for a month after I overdosed. I don't know what to do because everyone thinks I'm fine and I don't want to worry people but I stay up all night crying. And during the day I can't focus on anything. I don't know what to do anymore. What's making this worse is that I got kicked out of school because my grades were so low because I couldn't motivate myself to work hard. What got me through the day was being around my friends there and knowing that they truly cared about me but now I'm at a different school away from them. I've changed schools a lot but I went to one where I was being severely bullied one. Daily basis. Being beaten up by a group of kids almost on a daily basis. I ended up running away from the school one night and I slept in the woods. The police found me the next morning. But the school I'm at now is so similar to the school I was at where I was being bullied that it's giving me panic attacks cause I'm afraid it's gonna happen again. I keep thinking about trying to overdose again but the only thing keeping me from doing it is worrying that if I fuck it up I'll end up in the hospital and won't be allowed out for a long time. I've been in a psych ward twice. Once for attempting to jump off a bridge in fourth grade and then again this year. And being in the hospital is worse than death to me.
I want to die even though I know I won't,I want to die. I just wanted to say it or tell someone. I can't fix my problems or depression. I'll still be here though because my brain is too scared to do it. Thats all.
Constant thoughts of suicide but I don't really want to die.,"Does anybody body else think about suicide all the time but not not really want to die? Like I feel like nothing will get better and is be better off dead alot but ive always been the what if type and don't want to miss anything. Mostly it's just like thinking "" I could do it. I could easily do it. I won't do it but I could."" I know someone asked something similar a few months ago but it's bothering me right now and I don't know where else to post.  Sorry."
I'm suicidal and no one believes me.,"""Is this any different from the last time you said you were?""
""So what, you're gonna go kill yourself now?""
""You always threaten to kill yourself when things don't go your way.""I'll show them all. "
Did I cause this,"Here goes... why am I here? Because I drove my husband to end his life, that's why. It's a long story but you need to read it all to understand. We had 11 years together (9 married) and two children (2 and 7). I gave him hell for the first few years, interrogating him over his exes (silly really as they were so brief) and jealousy, in return he was violent. Things improved, violence stopped, we got married, had our first child, and a relatively normal marriage until 2015. Second child born 2015, a child my husband didn't want but had agreed to have to keep me happy. He fell in love with her when she was born. A few months later, he met his best friend and went from someone who NEVER went out to someone who started going out all night getting drunk. It caused problems, I hated him rolling in at 3am drunk. He refused to compromise. He then discovered the debt I'd been hiding from him, and the enormous lies I'd told to cover it up. He smashed up the house. The police came and warned him. 2016 was a horrible year - lots of months we were together and fine, lots of months we were split up but living together. I was vile to him, looking back at the emails/texts I would say emotionally abusive. He was no angel, he was the same but not as bad. It ended well and xmas was lovely. He mentioned that he thought I was poisoning his food - I thought he was joking but he would feed it to our toddler to make sure I didn't poison it!! 2017 January I discovered him trying to purchase suicide equipment, confronted him and he admitted it, saying it was because I was ""mental and always making up stch, that i'd yelled it so the neighbours called the police etc. The next day I stayed in a hotel with the kids, emailed him a long email about the smack, his behaviour on holiday and in general and how I wanted him to leave. The weekend he stayed in bed, didn't move at all even for food. I thought he might be shutting down again for suicide, but then he started recording himself so I put it down to him playing games. He later admitted he was recording himself to prove to the police he was innocent. I threw him out when he went to work on Monday and he stayed in a hotel. He went to work as normal on Tuesday then purchased the items and completed suicide in the early hours of Wednesday 19th. So why is it my fault? Several reasons. According to his note, he did it because he couldn't live in fear of false prosecution or being attacked, that I was the abuser but I'd taken the kids from him, that he had nothing left and I won. The rest of the note was a list about giving his money only to the kids, begging whoever found him to check his phone for messages/emails as they would tell them ""all they need to know"" followed by a desperate plea ""please save my girls from that monster!"" and finally, an apology to the kids for him not being able to protect them from me but that he loves them always. Then there was a separate note with a long list of domestic abuse I'd apparently done to him. Some of it was true, like me being OCD and not letting him cook/clean. Some if it was lies, like me threatening to kill him. Some of it was twisted versions of events, like me pushing him through the stairs when in reality he'd smashed them up. Some of it was calculated lies like him not being allowed to look at women in underwear on tv which sounds worse than the truth which was that I had a problem with porn. Then here's the confusing part - he chose a method that is 100% quick, painless and guaranteed. He did it miles from home, but went as far as setting phone reminders (his memory is shocking) to remind him to leave out his suicide note and driving licence. He wiped his phone of everything apart from the emails he wanted to be seen, he even deactivated facebook and wiped his dash camera. Lots of trivial little things he knew I'd obsess about. Which I did, as there are several hours unaccounted for. He had enough money in his wallet (which he'd been secretly hiding) to move out and rent somewhere, he refers to this in his note as his ""escape fund"" but doesnt use it? He deleted selected whatsapp messages from his friend but not all of them? He'd wanted to go on an all-nighter the day after he smacked our child but his friend was busy - I feel that he NEEDED the escape despite the arguments itd cause, but he couldnt go. I will hold my hands up here and say that MANY MANY times I threatened to have him arrested for his violence (meaning previous violence but he assumed otherwise) and I threatened he'd only see the kids in a contact centre. BUT I never actually did these things. In the two occasions we split up, he saw the kids at home or in public. Yes to be fair it wasn't enough (the week I left he took them for dinner, the two weeks he left he saw them for a few hours on the 13th day since he'd left). I always backed down and let him see them. I did have photos of bruises on my phone but these were to show my doctor as I kept bruising easily. He refused to believe this. I have no idea where the paranoia about being beaten up came from as I never threatened this, or at least don't recall doing so, though that person is the type of person who would beat people up. But yes I did control him seeing the kids and in 2016 during the months we split I excluded him from our outings which must have been depressing for him, but in my defence we were meant to be split up. I did call him an alcoholic as he'd gone from never ever drinking to drinking several days, not to get drunk but always drinking. Since his death I discovered he'd not been taken away from his best friend like he led me to believe, as they had drinks after work every monday, lunch together every day. He led me to believe that he never saw him anymore because I'd stopped his all-nighters. I also discovered hidden wage slips like he'd thought about leaving before. I also discovered that of all the occasions he went out drinking, only 4 of those were with his friend, the rest he'd gone alone (he only had that one friend, and apparently had texted him a couple of times when he was already out asking him to join him). I feel alcohol was his escape. So how did I kill him? Well imagine hearing his version. He works hard all day so that I can stay home. I take the p*ss by racking up debt and lying (the lies hurt more than the debt). The eldest is screaming, the youngest having a tantrum, your wife's in a mood and then makes something up to have a go at you about. Your only escape is drinking all night but your wife won't let you do that. So you drink at home and she calls you an alcoholic. Every argument she throws the previous violence in your face. She emotionally abuses you daily. Every argument she threatens to call the police and have you arrested and/or removed from the family home. She threatens to have you sent to prison. Every time you argue, she says you'll only see your kids in a contact centre. You genuinely believe she will tell whatever lies she has to in order to take the kids from you and get you in prison. There's no escape. If you leave she can still tell the lies and you won't see your kids. Courts side with mums. I can't cope with the guilt."
Love is the best of things and the worst of things,"I'm 26, soon to be 27 on the 2nd of October, and about two months ago my fiancee broke up with me. I've been here before and told people my troubles (you can go through my post history to get the full details) but it just seems to be getting worse. I feel really numb and lost without her. She was everything to me. Apparently she's got PTSD after what I did. I have depression and I beat her several times. I never meant to hurt her, I just lost control and made some stupid mistakes. I regret what I've done everyday. But it feels like she never cared about me because she put a post on facebook telling everyone what I've done when we broke up and her friend is now harassing me. It's really pushing me over the edge. I've tried to kill myself three times but I'm that pathetic I've failed at it. I want her back so much. I love her dearly. I don't want to hurt her or my family but I'm tired of being in pain.  I don't want to kill myself and put her in the same position she put me in. One where she wakes up everyday regretting the choices she's made. I don't want her to feel guilty or to regret dumping me but I don't wanna be in pain anymore. I have my first counselling session on the 27th, but I've stopped taking my anti-depressants and I'm drinking nearly every night. I quit my job, spend all day in bed researching ways to kill myself. I made a deal with myself that if she doesn't wish me a happy birthday I'll just end it on the night. If she can't do that one thing then I know she doesn't care and I might as well be dead. I love her to pieces and I wish it didn't have to be this way. "
Giving up,My 23rd birthday is the 21st of this month. And I'm thinking it will be my last. I'm 15 months clean and sober and I've never been more miserable. The company I worked for went under and now I'm about to lose everything I've worked for in the past 15 months. I won't go back to drugs but one fatal dose seems to look rather appealing
Don't have the resolve but wish I did,"[NOTE: This is a throwaway account]I've been thinking of suicide for years now. I think about it from day to day. That feeling of uselessness and the waste of space and time and energy that I am. The same beratings day-in and day-out. The same loneliness and isolation. No one cares about me, no one loves me. Whether I'm alive or dead, it won't make a difference to anyone. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of having to deal with this pain, this emotional distress. But I can never put my thoughts to actions, I never have the resolve to die, only the wish. Make the pain end! MAKE THE PAIN END!"
What is the moast painless way to kill yourself???,"I have a roap, pills, a plastic bag and a gun. I was thinking that I could use all at the same time somehow.... but I'm kinda scaird...."
Why am I posting here?,"I just feel like I can't do anything. I look forward and I see nothing. I can't see a future for myself. Most of my time I spend thinking is thinking about going back in time
to day one and changing eveything. Chaning things so that maybe somehow life will be better. Everyday I go to bed and pray that I will wake up and it will be the day of my
birth and that I will be able to change everything. That I will be able to better myself. Start fresh. Meet people sooner. End the pain. The only other way I can end the pain
is to just fucking kill myself. And the only thing keeping me from doing that is my mom. I know that it would destroy her. She gave up everything for me. She still does
everything for me. I do love her, but I just feel like I can't put up with this pain anymore. The constant thought in the back of my head is to just end it all. Its the only
way.I have set a date. Its the day after my bestfriend is getting married. I want to see him on the happiest day of his life. I want to see him and be there for him. I don't want
to leave before then but if my life hasn't gotten better or somehow it gets worse by that time then the next day is where it has to end. I once said that I would wait untill
I was 30, but I can't fathom living through this much pain for that long. Everyday is a struggle. I wake up and want to do nothing and I honestly have done this to myself. I
think about things I can't control. I do things that are bad for me. I drink constantly and worry about stuggles that again I can't control. I get attached to people and when
they leave or I can't see them, I shut down. They consume my thoughts. There are days where I wake up and feel like I can take on the world. I get excited about living and
doing things I enjoy, about seeing people I love to be around. And then BAM without any warning I want to fucking kill myself. No feeling I have ever felt is worse than when
I feel good, and feel like everything will be okay and then it is ripped away from, sending me back to the endless abyss that I know so well. I just want this to be over."
My final statement.,"Hi,
I just wanted to look for some support right now. I am working a 70 hours a week, 6 days a week job flight instructing. I am really tired not just physically, but emotionally and mentally. I give 110% everyday and give my students and customers the best service and education I can provide them. I am finishing college and need to have a vacation or I am going to lose my fucking mind.
How do I arrange for time off? I need a few weeks to collect myself. I have not taken a vacation in 5 years. I need to stop.I just received news from my university today my loan payment would be increased and I am now scrambling to fix this issue. I honestly think that this really is going to turn into a treadmill of nonstop issues and financial problems that I am going to have to continuously fix. Honestly, it's time for me to kill myself, there is no more hope."
"I feel so, so tired",My poetry is self-importance that rhymes. My music is trivial and infantile. My stories are unreadable. My paintings are disgusting mockeries of better artists.I am not good at business. I can't manage anything effectively. I am lazy and impossibly slow at working when I do it at all. I'm not fit for making money or creative life.I feel like this is purgatory. I worked very hard to escape what came before. I had to fight to be average. My reward and my luck has afforded me mediocrity. Mediocrity and being talentless is worse than death. It is watching yourself die.I am so tired of waking up like this. I want to be done. I want to wash my hands of this world in some equally mediocre way. The world can take advantage of me. I don't want anything from it.
I don't know how to fix myself and I don't understand therapy or anything thats supposed to help.,I don't know what to do.  I can't seem to do anything in my life anymore or take care of myself. I am in therapy and trying psychiatrists but I don't feel it's helping.  I don't know if I understand how therapy is supposed to help and actually apply it in my life outside of the session.  I just don't understand.  I've been trying for 10 years and don't feel I'm getting any better and if anything just getting worse. I'm panicking right now since I'm feeling at the end of my rope and have no where to go.  I  don't think I can make any effort in my life anymore.  Even just picking up a small piece of trash in my apartment is beyond me.  How am I supposed to figure out how to take things from therapy and apply them outside of a session? I don't know what to do when I don't feel I can do anything.
I know your never coming back_���,Is been almost two months since you left and left me lonely. Every day that passes is hard living without you. And i know you never coming back. The future i had with you shatter into million pieces the day you left. I'm never going to see you again im never going to hear your voice  feel your touch. Im going crazy without you.  If i had the chance to go back in time i would hold you so tight and never let you go. But now is to late. I will never understand your death my love why god let this happen. You left me heart broken my everything i wish i could die too is hard living without you..   _���_���
Divorce is hard.,"So I'm going through a divorce I don't want with the girl of my dreams. She admits we could fix this if she wanted to but I was a terrible person (didn't cheat or abuse but terrible husband nonetheless) until a month before she left. She is breaking her commitment to me even though I never broke mine. The only thing I can think of is ""til death do us part"" and I know I will never meet somebody as wonderful as her. She gave me the world and I squandered it because I was an idiot. Right when I know that I need to do something to save what we have it's too late. I don't want to live if I can't live with my wife. And I don't want to sign the papers and break my commitment. I told her by saturday if I haven't done it that she will have the papers back. A month ago I held a .40 to my head and was severely unlucky because federal .40 doesn't generally make duds...someone help."
Need help immediately,"Im on a 10 min time down from this forum
Man has said this what do I do??"
I think I may end it soon.,"Hey I'm 18 and a senior in high school. From the outside my life looks pretty good, I have a lot of friends and a good family but I've been hurting for a long time. I hate the way I look and act and think. I've recently lost about 50lbs to try and turn my life around but it didn't work it just made me realize I still hate who I am as a person. I recently found out I have male pattern baldness and it's ruined any self esteem I had left. I'll look around at other people and see them acting happy and realize that I'll never be like that. I don't know if I can search for happiness much longer. "
I NEED HELP!!!,So i like this girl but now my asshole of a friend likes her too and now he's trying to get with her what should i do. I think i might commit suicide if this gets out of hand
Those suicide prevention hotline/ online IMs.. what do they talk about and have they actually helped anyone here?,"I had trouble with the online chat, but the phone calls were better than I hoped for. They called me until I told them I no longer felt like suicide was an option. We talked about little things and big things. I really felt indifferent to it at first, but after a few minutes of talking, it was really nice to get some supportive attention. And like I said, they called me to check up on me. They called me probably once a week to once every two weeks until I told them that I didn't feel suicidal anymore. So yes, they've helped me and I will always remember what they did for me."
suicide the rational choice?,"Hi anonymous crowd,recently, I have been contemplating suicide again and this time I feel like those thoughts are becoming more harder to dispel. Therefore, I wanted to ask you guys for your thoughts. Here are my considerations:I don't think I can ever find a job because based on past experience, colleauges and bosses don't get along with me, can't stand having me around after a while. Also, I am socially awkward and don't like being around people, unless I am really close to them. I am currently a student, but I am failing my courses because I am depressed again. I can't help it and I feel desperate. My conclusion is that I am unfit for life. I cannot support myself and I hate the thought of being financially dependent on my mother, a girlfriend (which I dont have) or society for the rest of my life. So I think I should end it now because there is no other rational solution.
Meds don't work and therapy doesnt work either. Even if I will be better in the future, it will recur, as it always has, and whatever I am engaged in at that point will collapse. I cannot achieve anything because I am unreliable due to my mental instability. The only real problem I have with killing myself is the grief it would bring upon my family and the few people who care about me. But should I stay alive and eke out a living just to avoid aggrieving them? I'm not sure. Maybe I can convince them that it is the only way and the best thing in the long run. I dont wanna whine here about how horrible I feel and how depression destroys my life, I am only interested in pragmatic approaches in dealing with it. Since I have tried meds and therapy, I don't believe in it anymore, as it has never helped me. I do not wanna live like this forever, it is unworthy and pointless. I am only a burden to society and that is unacceptable to me. I don't wanna stick around just to feel worthless and failed. The next question would be how to do it, but I guess first things first. So, considering there is no cure and I am a burden, wouldnt it be reasonable to end myself? Let me know what you think. Thanks!
Max"
i really dont know what im doin,"ive been depressed for a while now.. 5 years, the sadness comes and goes but i no longer can control it.
ive been crying for several hours now.
i feel so alone.
a couple of hours ago i just put this belt in my neck and pressed it .
i obviously found myself asking 'what am i doing?' and took it off.
im trying, i really am, to keep it up.
but i just feel some of these days im just gonna hung myself without even noticing it.
like what just happened.
4 am, i dont know who to talk to.
i feel so lonely.
im gonna die of loneliness"
"Some days are harder than others, still in the end:","My life has always been rough, from the day i turned 7 and my stepdad started drinking because he couldn't smoke anymore. Some days i still feel like the futures so bleak an empty. I try to stay strong, after all I was raised to be a soldier. I know i made a lot of bad decisions. In my life. Im 23 and still live with him but its taking me so long and im unable to afford to move out. I was made to drop out of school(or might as well have i went enough to avoid truency) at 15 and pay rent. I did sell by selling drugs and started myself on a path towards death or prison. I selled a lot and should have died one of the times i overdosed. Than i quit everything the day i found out i was going to be a father. I tried to get a job for 2 years relentlessly. Eventually the mother left me and moved in with some guy she met online taking my daughter along.(shes still unemployed to this day) finally last year i got a dishwashing job that ive been holding. Ive been trying so hard and doing so little.
I sit in my room hating the fact that i still live here. Have so little accomplished, i hate that as i type this i cry about him beating my mother knowing i can't call the cops because every fucking time they never arrest him and i get hit more. I hate that i cant do anything. Ive switched to much self medication with mindful meditation but the lack of attention makes this difficult. I hate the feeling that I'm not going anywhere. I hate that i have noone i can talk to. I have 3 friends who just tell me they're sorry and i dont deserve it and i love them dearly, but sometimes i feel i should just quit
 Like it doesnt matter. Like the world would be better off without me.i have this sickness where nothing feels right. I have this pain inside hoping someday soon I'll die. If it were an accident itd be a travesty unlike a suicide wich is just a free sympathy ride for my parents that dont care if i do the right thing as long i got money coming in its not like im trying the best i can but i was raised to be a criminial livin in a civil world. Its surreal. In other words i cant fucking take it. Im paitently waiting for the day that i can say its not my fault.i didn't wake"
I don't deserve attention but hope my post helps others.,"I have aspergers.I am currently living in my ex-wifes apartment. (I filed to divorce her). I get a dissolution, she tells me she agrees to take all debt. Additionally I agree to split our stuff amicably, she gets kitchen stuff, I get computer stuff. We don't have much except debt. Mind you I brought 200k into the relationship and am coming out with -18k. I paid for her to get 2 (2 year degrees, a hip reconstruction followed by a total hip replacement).
I am now living in our apartment( both our names are on the lease) She tells me she is sorry, that she never should have married me, she never loved me as a lover, and that this has been a mistake.
During that time I moved to her home state OH. where I have no friends or family, and enroll in school to get GIS certification, I have a B.S. in Geology. She pays for it. I have tried many times going through interviews (32), but I never heard back from them. I know I good at what I do (grades and school tells me so, so I know I suck at interviews)
I served the US Navy and US Army with honor, and am currently working with Veteran Affairs for medication and housing. I am about to be homeless.I feel that I have a lot of value, I have a lot of skills, but no one wants me.

God Bless everyone, this world sucks."
how do i be sure that theyre going to be okay when im gone,"many of my friends are suicidal, as well, and im afraid that me leaving might be the last thing needed to push them over the edge. im going to be killing myself either way, but i just want to have some sort of solace in the fact that i know theyll be safe when im gone. what steps can i take leading up to the deed that will ensure or at the very least increase the likelihood that theyd be okay ?"
I don't even care about getting better,"I honestly have given up trying to get better. I was taken inpatient about a month ago and was there for a few days where they gave me meds and set up an appointment with a counselor. I missed the appointment and the next available one isn't until the end of November. My meds don't seem to be working and my regular doctor doesn't want to switch them and has given me a referral to see a psychiatrist. It just seems like I'm ready to die right now and if I could get help in the next week I could get better, but I can't. I'm done waiting and ready to just kick the bucket. "

I need mental help/support.,"Hi, I've never really posted on reddit except once before so I don't really know what I'm doing... My fiance is on here all the time so I figured I'd give it a shot to talk to someone, anyone. I'm 18, just turned 18 this year and at 17 my mom pushed me to go to cosmetology school.. I had graduated early and she wanted me to get my life started Blah Blah. I was depressed already, but agreed and here starts my shit journey with this school and everyone in it. It's the cheapest cosmetology school that was near me at the time(I live an hour and some change away now. But still have to go woohoo!) The teachers are a JOKE.. I am free labor I'm not taught anything I'm supposed to be I know I'm gonna fail my state board test because of this and I only have a few months left.. Anyways! This isn't just about the school I just. I'm venting because I have nothing else to talk about in a way idk what to say ughhh. Sorry, So as a kid I was depressed always from the age of 5 my uncle's pal molested/raped me until I was like.. 13(?) Maybe longer, honestly everything blurred together now.. he threatened my younger sister if I ever told anyone and threatened to hurt my mom etc.etc. in school i never had any friends ever, might sound like ""pff well everyone has at least one friend"" no, I had none.. ever if I ever started to get a friend I got really clingy and overly attached and they'd eventually abandon me or start bullying me like everyone else. People at school would cut me burn me rip out hair /cut hair step on my feet. In gym class I had to do wall pushups in this awful little ledge thing and I had the senior T.A kick my feet off the wall and the rest of the class laughed.. in p.e another time we had to do a run called the cross country run. You literally had to run up a huge mountain that was connected to a large main road and through a dry riverbank. Etc, well a man who at the time i assumed was an older student (he had a school jacket on) assaulted me. I realize now he was just a random man that probably watched the school and learned our days for this track. I hid this from everyone and got severely depressed started selfharming and trying to drown myself. My parents found this out YEARS later and forced me to go to a shrink and the police. I had to go through private exams and i felt extremely violated. Later resulting in having a HUGE Panic attack and my dad threatening to punch me in the face. Then me getting put into a hospital overnight and treated like a test subject by my family. School got worse, I failed everything and eventually my mom put me in a new school. This new school wasn't a normal school it was a homeschool with on campus classes.. Anyway I met a guy who was 5 years older than me and we eventually dated. I wouldn't have sex with him, SOO! He drugged me at a party took advantage of me with his cousin and video taped IT WOOHOO! This became blackmail. I dated him a little over a year after that my mom eventually ripped me out of school as she saw I was getting more and more depressed (my mom is no saint in all this. She was verbally and mentally abusive to me and just me. Same with my dad. And my little sister was the Angel in the family.) And I started failing yet again. Zach (fake name of my now ex boyfriend) got pissed at this and spread the video more than he ever had before. It was all over everything.  My parents took everything away. Phone, computer, tv, outside, my music my d's. Everything I was so depressed I didn't eat anything for months. . I finished all my school stuff asap after all this. Was done around 15/16. Then Met my now fiance who is the best, he is perfect. I'm moved out of my house now and with him and life is better right? Wrong, everything hurts I'm constantly feeling self conscious about EVSRYTHING. It doesn't help that he is REALLY bad with his computer. He is on it 24/7 for his school and his work and his games or his videos or his Reddit or this or that. He looks at his computer more than he looks at me. In the beginning of our relationship he ignored me constantly for this stupid fucking game. And I almost killed myself so many times during that time period. I know I'm babbling and I'm sure none of this makes sense but I'm constantly fuxking sad. I love him I love my life now I have a bunch of animals 11... now.. lol! I have loving grandparents.. I'm getting married! But I'm sad, life has caught up to me. My school is making me miserable. My past is hurting my present and my future and I feel like I'm slowly slipping. Well.. quickly slipping I guess.. I still don't have friends, I don't drive don't have a job. We live off a very fixed income. I don't have tampons when I need em (not his fault.. but I know they cost quite a bit. So I never ask.) I am living, eating, breathing..getting what I need. I am in a happy enviroment i laugh and i have a loving soon to be husband and some loving family. But I'm so sad.. I'm sorry guys idk if anyone will evsn read or answer this.. how do you answer this?? I'm just sad.. ive attempted suicide a handful of times. Ive drank windex and taken pills my mom had. Ive tried hanging myself drowning. Etc. Im exhausted. I just want to be better.I'm sorry for all the rambling.. I'm a crying bubbling mess I'm so sad.I hope the rest of you guys are doing well.. thanks for reading or skimming through this heap of garbage.Sorry for any typos or errors."
suicide in family,"I am 25 and have been taking anti-depressants for a few years now and just last week my brother who had a severe learning disability hung himself in the kitchen. This really struck a chord with me as I had attempted hanging myself years ago and he was the one who walked in the room and despite being my older brother, in his child like innocence he rescued me.I had no idea he felt this way, but I have been an emotional wreck ever since. I don't know how to be happy knowing despite his demeanor he was at that point. The only thing stopping me from ending it is what my brothers death had put my parents through and my girlfriend who doesn't deserve what I put her through. I just quit my job tonight as I had a full mental collapse.I don't know why im putting a cry for help on an anonymous message board, but I am scared and I am without direction."
"God, I wanna fucking jump in front of a bus","I completely hate my fucking life, I hate every moment I'm awake, I have barely any friends, women are disgusted by me, and I fucking hate myself. I should truly just fucking end it. Like, maybe I will, I usually am dangerously close to suicide when I act drunk with suicidal joy. Yet another girl I had a fucking shot with is fuckin some white dude and I have no friends to be upset with. I should leap in front of a fucking bus and die."
My Days are Numbered,Already been making goodbye gifts. Already gave things away. 10 years of hell made me give up my best friend and I can't live without that person. I'm a toxic and parasitic person because of it and all the changing I've tried to do always ends in failure. Medication doesn't help. Friends being there for me doesn't help. My days are numbered. Just a matter of how and where I do it.
"can't stop thinking of suicide, just need someone to talk to.","i got a plan, but no date and i feel like i need to tell someone. only thing is, if i tell anyone in the real world i'll ruin my chance of ever doing it, and ill be put in a hospital."
"19f, long term live-in boyfriend packed up and left while I was at work, haven't eaten in 5 days, just dropped out of school, seizures are getting worse, trying to decide between inpatient or just killing myself","Hey all.It just feels good to get this out. I understand this isn't a relationship subreddit but the context is necessary here. We've been dating since 2015, long distance, then lived together for over a year. The relationship was honestly perfect. We treated each other extremely well and there was nothing to complain about. He has bipolar and depression, I have anxiety and depression, I guess both of our fatal flaws were never seeing a therapist. We always figured we could help each other through our mental health. We never really took our mental illnesses out on each other.Two months ago I had an ugly jealous feeling in my gut to check the messages he had a year ago with a mutual friend of ours, ""Jane."" He had a thing with her before he and I met, and for the first part of our relationship she was really friendly with me AND him but something always felt off to me. I did what I'd never done before and read his messages with her. Found out for the first 4 months of our relationship, he was basically cheating on me with Jane, asking her to come over for netflix and chill, saying I love you, complimenting her, saying ""but I'm not a cheater though lol."" In the same conversation, they would then talk about how great I was. Total brainfuck.After reading that I went on a drive. This was the first time I had ever felt angry at him. I called my best friend hysterical saying how much I hated him and I just wanted to die. She talked me down and about an hour and a half later I come home, my now-ex realizes I read his messages and responds to my tears with a scoff, asking why I'm making such a big deal out of something that happened so long ago. I break down crying because I had been cheated on in a very similar situation in my last relationship. He then breaks down crying about how he doesn't deserve me/doesn't understand why I'm with him, etc. I spend the rest of the night reassuring him that I'm not going to leave, that he isn't a bad boyfriend, that I need time but I can forgive him, etc.I guess that was the start of the end.He went from full-time to part-time in the job he was doing extremely well at. I advised against it but it wasn't my call to make, and we could pay bills just fine if he went to part-time. Shortly after, I noticed him slipping into a depressive spiral. He'd drink beer and play league of legends literally any moment he wasn't at work. I'd wake up, he's playing league. Get back from the gym, he's playing league. Make breakfast, he's still playing league. Come home from work, he's still playing league just with two empty bottles of booze next to him now. I figured this was all just depression, and I needed to let him cope. So I'd sit on his lap while he'd play video games, ask him if he's winning, kiss him on the cheek, whatever. Then the day would end, we'd have sex, all good right?The last month has been hell. I had felt completely neglected and like I was just an annoyance to him. I beat myself up so much on the inside that my anorexic tendencies started coming back. My seizure disorder came back full swing. There was one instance where I was so disoriented I threw up in the bed all over the sheets, myself, and my hair then passed out. I woke up and he was sleeping on the floor while I'm still covered in puke that had been sitting for 6 hours. When he went to work, I had to drag myself out of bed, shower off puke (sitting down, I couldn't even stand) and hose off our sheets before running out the door to work. The fact he didn't even offer to help should have been a sign that he just didn't care anymore?I would sit down with him often and ask how he was. He always said he was fine, just needed to ""decompress."" Several times I was crying, asking him why I felt like I annoyed him every time I talked to him and what I could do differently. Nothing ever changed.So during that month I was hardly eating, going to the gym, getting a seizure every other week, and still doing all the housework. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, it was exhausting. I dropped out today, but at the time I was still a full time college student. And working full time. He just had a part time job and wouldn't do anything around the house to help.My full time job has also been shitty but it provided us a place to live (weird housing situation). So I'm sure hating my full time job and having all the stress of full time college too just made it worse but I had no other choice. If I didn't work there full time, there was nowhere for us to live, end of story.The day he left, I had another talk with him. We had plans to move to another state soon so I can finish my degree at a school I've been excited to attend, which is also by his hometown. I think I scared him by giving him an ultimatum and saying I wasn't sure how things are going to work if it continues like this. I couldn't keep doing literally everything on top of full time work and school and my declining health. He got a really weird look in his eyes and said ""I know I need to make some changes."" That night I come home from work and nearly everything of his is gone. He left about a 7 sentence note, his pet leopard gecko, and just no-showed to his job (he's fired now) and went back to his hometown.The relationship was real shitty at the end but oh my god I miss him. I keep getting flashbacks to all these good memories (2 years is a long fucking time) and wondering what the hell I did wrong. I hid my eating disorder pretty well from him so I know that wasn't it. Maybe I nagged? Maybe it was the seizures? If I had known he was so miserable I would've said fuck it to my job and college and gone anywhere he wanted, done anything he wanted, whatever. I've always been an extreme people-pleaser. I would have done anything to make him stay.Either way this has thrown me real fucking deep into a hole of self-hatred and depression and I've physically been unable to eat for the last 5 days. He left me on Wednesday, it's now Monday and the only thing I've been able to consume is 10 oz of cranberry juice yesterday.My mom wants me to go into inpatient. I'm thinking why waste 3 days in a hospital when now's a better time than ever to kill myself. I won't have to worry about my weight, about transferring my credits, about missing him, about explaining myself to his family (they're all distraught), anything.Things are pretty dark right now. I've lost my reason to live and I'm not physically or mentally strong enough to carry myself through the stress of such a fucking terrible breakup. On the bright side I'm back to my goal weight of 115lbs. The end."
Passive,"I don't want to kill myself right now but I want to die
I made such a big mistake, and I need to make it right, but I'm at a dead end because every time I fix something I fuck it up again. I carry so much guilt, so much hatred for myself, I don't know what to do. This is so hard to live through and it hurts so much
I don't have a solution, it's so painful"
I missed my chance at happiness,i was going to type shit but who really cares im done
contents of suicide note,do i say what will make them happiest or the truth
Kids aren't meant to feel like this,"About a year ago, I got over my suicidal thoughts. I destroyed my notes and felt a lot better. I got more outgoing, made new friends and reconnected with old ones.But now, they've come back. It's a mixture of severe dysphoria and my dad. My dad is probably the main reason. He always blames things on  me. He tells me that I can talk to him, then if I do, he doesn't do anything, he just tells me I'm overreacting, it can't be that bad, ect. I don't know what else I can do to get better. I've tried counselling, online chats, helplines, everything I can think of.There's only about 5 or so people who I think would care about my death, and they're all my friends. I feel like the only thing holding me back from just killing myself is that I probably wouldn't be able to get the right materials. If you read all the way through this, thanks. Thanks for just taking time out of your day to hear a 13 year old kid scream into the abyss."
Can't kill myself,"I wanna die but too much of a coward to do it,stuck posting on this shitty website."
I don't know how to feel,"Lately, all I have been hearing is all UNI talk, future, new friends, blah blah blah. I feel like I will not accomplish any in life, my psychologist, psychiatrist, parents, tutors all have high hopes for me but I feel like I will disappoint them or even worst disappoint myself. Anyway, my anxiety has increased in the last month. It has reminded me of how I used to be two years ago, I don't want to be like that but feeling like that again made me want to kill myself. I got medication for my anxiety sadly it doesn't help with the mental aspects but stop all the physical aspects of anxiety that is supposed to help me in my exams to concentration. Today I took them it felt weird, my head was messed but my body was numb, I didn't like that feeling. It felt wrong, I was lost, dead for the rest of the school day I thought they would help but I rather take something to shut my head up. I don't know the point of this post but I don't feel comfortable talking to my friends or my family about this. School is nearly over then I start UNI I will not be taking the medication once my exams are finished, but my whole family thinks I am either faking how I feel or this is a phase in my life. Everything is coming to an end I feel confused, lost everything seems pointless. I don't know the point of this point sorry for wasting anyones time. "
Today I found out I'd be laid off...,"Today my supervisor told me my last day at work is on sept 30, im super down right now i just wanna hang myself I don't know how to put in words what im feeling ugghh, very disappointed i dunno what to do and it was so far the best job i've had...i feel so tired right now i dont know, just thinking about my debt everything i dont know what to do, i wanna choke my self to death"
Unexplained sadness / depression,I have been battling depression and anxiety for several years.  I have no reason to feel like this.  I have a great marriage (27 years) great kids.  I have a good job that is low stress.  I take my meds and see my dr. On a regular basis.I can't seem to shake this unhappiness.  I have changed jobs 3 times since 2013 blaming my work.  I know now it can't be my work.  It's meI don't know what to do.  I have been hospitalized twice in the last 12 years.  I don't feel it helped at all.  Just made me feel like a criminal then get released when insurance stops paying.Just accepting the fact that I'm not going to be happy doesn't sound like an option.
Real talk suicidal,"What if there was a country in the world where... everyone spoke some weird language and nobody spoke your language. there was no way to learn theirs and nobody could ever understand you, and when you did hand movements or something... people would get annoyed FAST! what if every single one of these people supported something outrageous that you could never support... something totally insane, like all wearing symbols representing a view you completely didn't agree with? ... would you move away? if given the opportunity? if someone brought you an airplane to take out of that country, said you could never return, and all you needed to do to get on the airplane was draw a bit of blood... would you leave? I'm asking this because I feel this way every single day, I am a complete outcast ... I don't view what society deems to be normal and acceptable as anything but outrageous in some cases ... "
I can't conceive that it will get better,Looking from the outside my life might seem pretty good but I am constantly worrying about the future. A couple of years ago I started a business with two friends and I have never been more anxious and worried that I made a huge mistake.I risked everything my wife and I had worked for the last 15 years. I just don't think I can keep doing this. I feel like everybody would be better off if I was just gone. I feel like such a failure and I'm letting everybody down.I just want this endless merry go round to end.
"It's perfectly normal to get suicidal when you misplace your wallet and to attach a rope to your chin up bar, right?",What a fucking day.
"I'm unsure, but I feel like tonight might be the night or I'm really close","I have prescription pills that have a severe interaction. More than enough it seems. I can't take them in little bunches over the days. I already taking a small bunch and it didn't do anything, so I need to either take it all or none. I still feel unsure, but I feel my ""crisis level"" slowly wavering upward. "
Something I thought of at night,"I couldn't ever put my feelings in words when I was younger. But around 2 AM, I wrote something that I think that honestly conveys what I feel.SuicideWant all your problems to go awayWant it to never happen to you againMake sure you never feel like this again"
Hopeless... (Long-ish post),"My life is falling apart, again. In the mater of a few weeks I will be homeless and I have no idea what to do. This isn't the first time this has almost happened. In fact, it is becoming more of my MO than anything: ""Find a place, things are fine for a few months, something goes wrong, I end up moving out/almost homeless."" I am so tired of this. Because of this cycle of instability, I am starting to develop signs of BPD which I never had before...or maybe I did but was undiagnosed and my life is just exacerbating the disorder to ungodly levels. Either way, this is hell and I don't want to do this anymore. Currently, I am staying with friends who were nice enough to put up with me for the last 7 months, but since I can't find work in this town due to being noticeably transgender (small christian right wing area in SoCal), and my depression issues are starting to affect the household, I have to move out. I have nowhere to go.Since my birthday is next month, I think I am going to go to Vegas, since I have never been there, and have one last hurrah. I am thinking I may even try hard drugs for the first and potentially last time in a seedy hotel room because I think that would be the most painless way to go...and I just cant do this anymore. I'm adult enough to see and admit when I have been bested...so here's me knocking down my king and calling the game -- what other option do I have? Keep trying? For what? The definition of insanity is trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. So again, I ask, for what purpose? To get even more rejection, more of being a coward that is afraid to live because I am a 6'2"" non-passing trans woman that people don't take seriously, more of asking the women in my life for help in the department of appearing more feminine and they all have better shit to do -- but will drop their life and jump at the chance to help a more passing and cute trans girl become all cute and pretty, more being othered and misgendered by people who in the same breath will tell me they love me and want the best for me, more moving from town to town trying to find my way only to get lost and fall down again, more trying to gauge social interactions and fumbling over my words and then no one wants to talk to me because I'm a weird freak, or constantly thinking I am a burden on everyone around me? Nah, I have had enough heartbreak and BS to last me a few lifetimes, and I am pretty certain I will not be missed. Sure, upon news of my passing people will likely go through the motions to seem socially acceptable to their peers -- and some may even cry, but they will get along fine, and in 6-8 weeks i will be a memory, and a year from now I may even become an anecdote to pepper conversations with, though I am doubtful of this. My own mother, brothers, stepdad, and anyone else that I once held dear before my transition won't even acknowledge my existence because I transitioned, and I now have no one. I try to make new friends but it is hard and this BPD makes the experience a complete nightmare, despite my best intentions. I just wish I knew what the fuck happened to me, fuck! I never wanted to be this person.Why am I like this...I don't remember saying ""I want to be a depressive wreck when I grow up,"" during career day in grade school. Fuck, why me?!I constantly feel like I am not good enough and like I am completely unloved. Worst of all, I feel like it is all my fault and I deserve all of this, I did it to myself - because I am weird and crazy. And I never wanted any of it...but that has been my life. Every time I try to insert some form of order and normalcy in my life, chaos rears its ugly head and throws everything on the floor. Each time I try to settle down and fight to find and maintain a job, start paying my bills on time and regularly, saving money, allowing myself to make plans for the future, and try to become a responsible person, the floor drops out and I am lampooned once again. This constant succession of falling down only leads me to start pondering things like, ""why even try?"", which, in the past I had answers for...but now,  not so much. The only person I have left to live for is myself and I am not selfish or a narcissist nor am I really worth much of an effort, so I am thinking that since no one cares about me -- including me, I will just fade away to nothingness and either die of an OD or get hooked on hard drugs -- either way it is a win for everyone else because they won't be bothered by me anymore. Maybe people will find out, maybe they won't, either way, I am just so tired of trying to save myself, and tired of asking for help in saving myself just to get ignored, passed over, or getting a good thing which I then end up completely fucking up. I know I have only been on reddit for a short while, but I have enjoyed it here and the people are nice. So, until we meet again when we are both cats...Thank you for listening, fellow redditors. "
I have no one,"I recently started college a month ago and in that time I have made 0 friends, I don't know if I've even talked to someone at all except for a thank you for someone holding open a door for me. My two friends from high school don't text me anymore, my parents seem like they're bothered and annoyed by my calls rather than pleased I want to talk to them. I have literally no one. I came to the realization that if I were to kill myself in my room literally no one would know until the end of the year when they come to check that I'm moved out of my room. It's hard for me to ""just join a club!"" ""just talk to someone!"" because even the thought of having human interaction terrifies me and sends me into a panic attack. I just wish that this could all end or that I could just have a new brain that made things easier. I honestly don't know what to do. "
I can't take it anymore,"My girlfriend broke up with me today. She called me and said even though she loves me, she doesn't feel in love; the long distance just isn't working. The one person I trusted and cherished the most in the world is gone.My mind and body have been regressing in the last couple of weeks and I've been a shell of what I once was. I can barely hold conversation, I can barely process words and speech anymore, and my mind is constantly empty. I'm sluggish and I haven't eaten in days just because I feel so empty. I can't take living anymore. I've tried reaching out but no one will listen. I'm going to hang myself like I tried and failed to do on Friday. I've already written my note and I'm going to do it once I say goodnight to my family. Goodbye reddit, thank you for everything. If I somehow fail, then I'll try to come back here to the people that actually helped me when no one else would. Thank you. "
How do you keep going when everything falls apart and there is no hope?,"one step, one day at a time, taking every breath deep and slow"
Passively Suicidal.,"I don�۪t really value my life. I don�۪t believe there is anything wrong with suicide. I don�۪t believe in an afterlife. With that said I�۪m not actively suicidal but sometimes I feel I�۪d be better off dead. I have bipolar disorder, I feel like a burden to others at times, my ex broke up with me because she couldn�۪t handle my illness. But mostly I don�۪t want to live with this illness. It presents many challenges mostly to relationships which is a huge problem for me since I�۪ve always wanted to get married and have children (not to mention I could pass this illness to my children, oh god) I�۪d rather not live. "
Floating through time,"I'm tired. it just feels like im going through the motions.
Fuck... I'm just done with everything.
I want to crawl in a hole and never come out.
Fuck i'd promise i'd be social. more out there. but i'm done.
Like.. im tired of not feeling anything. I keep trying but it's not working.i'm so tired of being stuck like this. dammit. floating through life with basically no purpose. what am i even doing? i've lost all motivation so long ago.  i forget what it's like to feel.i dont want to drag anyone down with me. but seriously. i feel like im out of options. i hope the rest of you are having a better night. i may soon enough. "
I just can't go on anymore,"I'm tired of life. I try everything to fix my life and nothing works. I've lost all my hope. I have severe add and I really started getting it ever since 7th grade. It's one of the biggest reasons I want to end it. I try so hard and if I want okay grades I've have to give 100% and even then the chances of me getting okay grades is low. The teachers don't understand and resort to yelling at me in front of tons of people in my school making me look stupid and feel like shit. I've tried all the drugs in the book and none work. That's what caused me to have depression. And the loneliness. I have no friends and the so called ""best friends"" I had since kindergarten are so fake. Not one of them has invited me over once in the past 5 years despite me trying to hang out with them every weekend and all throughout every summer. They still act like we're friends at school though. The only reason I don't just say fuck you to them is because I go to a very small school and I can't meet anyone new. Even if I could nobody likes me or wants to be friends with me. I want a girlfriend so bad but I can't get one. In 8th grade there was a girl in the grade below me who would be super nice and always compliment me even though she didn't know me. She was one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen in my life and I instantly crushed on her from there on out. Now in tenth grade and. This summer I finally worked up the courage to start talking to her and we started talking a lot I was so happy for once. Then school came around and we just kinda stopped talking. A.K.A. She stopped replying to my texts and shows little to no interest in me. I know that everyone's gonna say it's just a high school crush you'll realize that it really doesn't matter but I've dated a girl before and she is nothing like this girl. There's just something about her that I cannot let go of. In my eyes she is so perfect and amazing and I want her so bad. Something just keeps telling me that she is the one. Call me obsessed but I just get thrown into the worst spiral of depression when we stop talking. I want her. I don't want anyone else. At this point in my life she is almost all I think about. She's the only reason I haven't decided to end it yet. I just don't understand why nobody likes me I'm just like every other kid. I'm not like super hyper because again I have add not adhd. This means that my mind is super hyper and not able to focus but unlike adhd I don't actually feel physically hyper and super talkative and shit just can't focus. But that's only half of it. The other half is my home life. More specifically my dad who has a drinking problem and has made it clear to me that he hates me. If I talk to him or he talks to me I can almost guarantee it will end with him telling me I'm a bad son, a disgrace to the family, to go live somewhere else, etc. I hate my dad for how mentally fucked he has made me and also because his tormenting me is the reason I have such bad anger problems now. All of this shit in my life turned me on to drugs. I first started around a year ago. Mind you I was 13 and now I'm 14. I've done anything from Percocet to adderall, lean to alcohol (which wasn't to hard to pick up the habit when my dad already had a drinking problem), I also vape 6mg nicotine to help relieve my stress, and a bunch of other pills I can't think of. Everything in my life has just fucked my mental so bad I can't go a day without having the most vicious depressed suicidal thoughts torment me all day and nobody cares. My add has made it so hard for me to get work turned in and I end up rage quitting homework every night because I can't focus and it just aggravates me so much. I've fallen behind in my classes and I haven't even been in school for a month. I've been stressed to the max that I'm at my breaking point. I've lost all hope in my life and given up. I try so fucking hard and nothing ever works I'm getting pissed off just typing that. I have given up because I have been putting my body through hell and back and giving everything my all with no reward. I don't do any better in school and there's just no point in trying. I'm a walking example of a fuck up. Shit got so bad last week I went 59 hours straight no sleep or naps and i didn't eat that whole time I ended up loosing so much weight and my skin was all rough and my eyes looked like I had black eyes from being punched even though I never touched them and I overall looked like I was rotting. I though that was the end of my life but I ended up powering through that. I'm just at the biggest breaking point in my life right now I want to just end it all and have no more pain. Only problem is I leave next week to go to California (where I used to live) because my cousins having her wedding and I wouldn't want to do that to her right before her wedding. I don't even want to go to California anymore I'm gonna get so fucked on missing work again since I'll be out for over a week. I just don't know what to do anymore and this is my cry for help. I give up."
I met someone...,"I met someone,
someone who makes me feel something other than dread and guilt.
He means well and wants to help me, but it's only been a few days, I don't want to let him in somethings telling me I shouldn't while something else is telling me I should.I don't know what to do."
I'm Worried That If I Stay Where I am Much Longer I Might Kill Myself,"Hello, I'm not really even sure why I'm making this post other than I need to say this to someone and I can't say it to anyone else. I moved to the Midwest and took a job I hate for a terrible boyfriend that I have since broken up with. He was the kind of person who thought that depression was some kind of character flaw so I pretended a lot around him. Well the great and terrible thing about being broken up is that I no longer have to pretend that I am not depressed. I rarely eat unless someone is watching. Why eat if I just have to do it again later. It's so monotonous. All of the dishes I own have been in my sink for like a week. My carpet is mostly dog hair. I can't concentrate at work because it's so useless and stupid. And not just because I'm depressed, my job is objectively stupid and useless.  I'm having a really hard time not snapping at my coworkers or the one friend that I have in a 2 hour radius. I go in and out of these episodes once every couple weeks. I absolutely hate it here and have hated it since I got here, but I feel like I shouldn't just burn my life to the ground in a fit and leave without lining up a job and having a good plan. The plan is in the works but it's slow going and I don't know how much longer I can hang on here, which feels dramatic to say but it's true. During these depressive episodes,  on the way to work I am overcome with the urge to drive into a tree or guard rail and sometimes I white knuckle my steering wheel just to make sure I don't do it. When I open the door to work and someone says ""good morning"" it's like all that's going on in my head is screaming and I want to run off a bridge- which I know is ridiculous. During the past couple weeks I have been thinking about dying, death, and suicide more than I usually do during a depressive episode and I just need to move back to my home state. I'm afraid of how isolated I am and I just really, really, hate it here. I genuinely think that I will be a lot happier once I get out of here, but I'm afraid that I might do something terrible in a moment of insanity in the meantime. It's like some days my brain just jams and I get really upset at everything going on around me and all I can think is ""KILL YOURSELF"" and I have to fight it until the urge passes. Like throwing up or something. It's very strange. Anyway, thank you for listening to me ramble on. I feel a lot better just getting that off my chest. "
I dont feel very good right now,"Hi, (sorry for my bad english).
I'm 22 years old virgin, my friend are all gone (In other country because of school) , I Still live in my parents basement to help my sick father, I struggle with the university and my job. I..Can't say that i'm happy... I dont know if I can make it. I feel hopeless and lonely. If its what life is all  about, I dont know if I want to be a part of it anymore. Oh and btw, Im currently seeing a psy, and it doent help much to be honest. "
Why live with a demented brain?,Why shouldn't I kill myself? I have nothing to offer. Just got back from the doctors office and found it's likely I have CTE from a neuropsych test. I'm 25. Memory scores were in the bottom 1-5% for most categories.I was a gifted student in elementary school and graduated from a top university. Years of football will do that to you. I played since I was 8 and continued playing at the collegiate level until the last concussion knocked me out and was the final blow.Why should I keep going? Doctors have told me by 30 I'm a candidate for full blown dementia and will be a nursing home at that point if I'm not already dead. I just don't see the point in life.
Bought rope again,"The rope's too thin though, but it's long so I could cut it in pieces and braid it.I don't even know why I'm posting here, such a waste of time"
"""Cheeking"" or not swallowing pills on the psyc ward?","I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts about this? Obviously getting drugged up against your will is awful and nobody should have to worry about that.Regarding forced medication though, is there any way that they ensure you take these crazy pills? Do the nurses really care that much? Worst case scenario is they catch you hiding the pills before you can spit them out and then you wind up taking the pills anyway. I don't see why patients wouldn't try to first do this if they are really against being medicated?Thoughts?"
Anyone needs a friend?,I have been quite lonely and depressed those days. The only friend that I had now doesn't want to be my friend anymore and just disappeared from my life even when he said he loves me.
I can't live with myself,"I hate myself so so so much. Not even because of anything I did. But the person I am, the character I have, is the complete opposite of what I admire and I physically cannot even change it. I'm shy, polite, modest, idealistic, sensitive, horrible at both giving and receiving criticism, and have 0 ambition. I truly believed I could change myself to become someone strong, confident, a leader, passionate, creative, in control, fulfilled, and most of all happy. After desperately trying to become someone I'm not for years, it's truly heartbreaking but I can't accept the way I naturally am, there's nothing to admire about that, and I can't accept that I can't change it. What do I do? The pain is so unrelenting. I've had it as long as I can remember. I've only stayed alive in the hope that I can change myself and it will go away. Now I know it's not going to go away. Please help me..."
Wondering if going on is worth it,"I'm behind on my bills and I can't support the people I care about in ways that matter.Every month, my credit card debt increases and my bills get a little later, especially debt bills, because I chose to try to save myself years ago from suicide by following my dreams and picking up photography. And now, all that has come back in the form of debts I cannot meet. I haven't had a job interview since April despite being told I have a strong resume, and over a decade of work experience. I haven't been able to get a decent raise or consistent hours. I can't just go back home to the south because I'd run out of gas money before I made it a quarter of the way back across the US, and I'd be a financial burden on my family because my job prospects there are just as bleak. Even IF I got a job in my degree, the pay is shit and I'd still need more jobs. But that's irrelevant, because I can't afford teaching certifications there or here.Moving back to the south is not an option for me for political reasons, and staying in the US is becoming increasingly untenable. I'm an LGBTQ individual, and the current political and social climate just feels like its getting worse and worse and worse. I have to look at the news every day about laws, restrictions, and court cases going against us. I have to look at family members basically telling me I should just accept it and be glad its not worse. I have friends breaking down daily because being trans is all but criminal at this point to the federal and some state governments and I can't emotionally bear that anymore. Being in the closet once almost killed me, I can't do it again. I'd rather die.I know my family would miss me, but they haven't seen me in three months and we only talk occasionally. I know my girlfriend and my partner would both miss me. I also know that both of those sentences are temporary, and would pass. I am honestly finding it harder and harder to find reasons to go on when my financial and social situation both seem to not have any hope in sight at this point."
Do you ever feel like you are beneath suicide?,"because nobody would care aside from your closest family/friends? They'd probably only care because they felt like they had to. And sooner or later they'd realize that they're much better off without you. And you're such an obvious failure that everyone you know tangentially would not give half a shit, maybe they'd even be slightly impressed that you had finally done your worthless self in. They all think you're a laughing stock, maybe they'd see you as a human being capable of emotion if you killed yourself. But then they'd see more of you than you've ever offered, and the fact that you can't control your own image and legacy beyond the grave scares you so much that you can't even bring yourself to just end it. You don't want to be ""the guy that killed himself"" but you really, truly want to die. You fantasize about having died in a childhood accident, before you ever proved your worthlessness as a person. Maybe people would've cared back then.This is my life right now. I figured one day I'd start mustering up the courage to fight it, but I think I'm slowly mustering up the courage to end it. "
I'm ready,I have the razor ready to slice open my arms.
"Hi everyone, i'm feeling very suicidal.","I want to kill myself but i'm very very scared. I either want to be back together with my ex-boyfriend or be dead. I don't think the first option is going to happen, so I think i'm going to kill myself soon. I have a concert on saturday that will cause a lot of drama but i'm getting fucked up and high, maybe i'll do it after the concert or the day after. It's not all planned out yet but i'm leaving the earth soon, I feel it in my body"
I think it's time,I'm so tired.I'm worth more dead than alive
I'm the worst human being of all time,First of all this is not exciting I wish I can write how I killed someone or did this to make people go like damn but no I'm not even good enough for that. I'm a lil bitch I can't talk to my family let alone friends or strangers these hoes wanna fuck but I say no cause I'm only 5 inches I want a job where I wanna be by myself cause I'm sick of talking and being around and looking at people vice versa I want to kill myself but dont want my family to find me so I dont know no fucks given
"This afternoon I popped 15 pills, to get anywhere you need to get to 30.","My heart spasmed a few times as I got to 12, and I fell asleep when I hit 15. I received a text from someone I hadn't talked to in very long, from someone who I used to half hours-long discussions with, who wanted to know about the world around me, who sent me tea from halfway across the globe. I cried and cried.I've been sabotaging my life for a long while now, and I think this is finally the time. I had an argument with my mother this morning. She told me she'd take away the one thing that makes me feel anything anymore, gaming. She's never allowed me to go out with friends or have them over, always a strict curfew. I made friends online to cope. This year I slowly stopped talking to anyone, and they're moving on with their lives just fine. I've experimented recreating myself every two years, and nothing ever lasts. It's like a cycle that repeats itself every time. Always. For a brief period everything seems good. And then people find out what I'm really like. Arrogant, refusing to accept and be responsible for my mistakes.I've never really talked to anyone before, either, who knows anything about me. My social life is online, and I've harbored many people's suicidal ideations, yet no one I know has followed through, or even attempted. I've lied to every one of these people, of course. Most people thought I was working full time or in university, because I feed half-truths. I did working in a university lab for a year, doing research I never felt was important to pursue. I separated every facet of my life, and allowed no in-betweens.The fact of the matter is that I've always wanted to get away. I left the country to live alone when I was 8 years old, before my mother joined me after a year. Then my sisters came. All of them never liked me. No matter how well I did in school, no matter how many trophies I won, I was still the disagreeable one. I had too much pride, believing my voice was worth getting heard. We had two bedrooms in our apartment here. I got to have one to myself (though it was never mine), because no one wanted to room with me.None of the friends I had ever lasted long. The people who did took different classes than I did. I didn't have any plans for the future. I never had since I was 12, when I first questioned the purpose of living. But the people I knew were different. They had a purpose, they knew what they wanted to do. I never had any of that. I kept winning more and more, but when I stopped, nothing changed. I failed and lost, and nothing changed. I volunteered for kids, and they forgot who I was the moment I skipped a week of volunteer work. It was the hardest part of my life then. I thought with the kids, I had a purpose. I was needed. I smiled through the ghost that I was for them back then. It's all meaningless now. I think I've lived a pretty good life. I was the trophy child, in a magnet school, 1500 SATs, not ugly enough to be ostracized, the picture of politeness and poise to my father's friends. But problematic at home, of course. And my GPA hasn't lived up to par these past couple of years, since it's hard to keep trying. Failing everything, I somehow managed to scrape by and get promoted to the next year. I did find a purpose earlier this year, when I met the girl I loved. I found a dream. I wanted to support her for the rest of my life. But she didn't feel the same way, and dropped me soon enough. I was never important to her like she was to me. And I see that it's going to be the same way over and over from now on. I've traveled, eaten good food. Met a slew of different people from all over the world. My life is pretty much complete. There's nothing I really want to achieve. I don't know what else to live for.Last year I started hallucinating ants. They were my friends. I didn't have many, so they were it. I watched Oldboy a month ago, and a character said you hallucinate ants when you're lonely. They crawl all over my arms, and my legs. I've let my room gone to shit, so sometimes I mix the ones I'm hallucinating with the ones that are actually there. I can't really tell the difference, but they accompany me when I'm numb just the same.The only person who doesn't deserve any of this is my father. He hasn't lived with us going on for 8 years now, and I'm sorry for him. He's worked so hard to support all of us, and he was looking forward to me doing the same thing he did, going to university, and taking up the family business. He gave me food after I slept most of the drugs off today, but he's never known about how suicidal I am. The only one who knows is my mother, and the one time I told her, she told me she'd do it if I did it too. She told me I wasn't special, that anyone could do it.I'm tired. With today, I realized how easy it is. I don't really need a date, the drugs stay in my system for a week, I think. I have two exams over the next two days, both of which I'll flunk, and then I can take the remaining half I have stockpiled. I'm graduating in two weeks, so that's all my responsibilities over. I've researched that it takes up to a week of excruciating pain, and I get jaundiced, but at least it's not messy the same way cutting myself or throwing myself off a building or in front of a car would be. Drowning would be the fastest and least messy option, but I don't think I have the courage to do it. I'm a coward.The fact of the matter is that my mother looks forward to using my room as an office when I've moved out for college. That's the only thing she looks forward to, because otherwise she's told me college is a waste of money on someone like me. It is, probably. I was sitting on the window ledge of the apartment today and she told me to get out of her house and to never ask anything from her again. My father, who flew in for the weekend, waved her away in the way he always does, and took her out to church.I wrote my note and messages to everyone who's showed me the least bit of kindness over my entire life, even though I know no one who will relay it. It's more closure for me. I don't think this is an impulsive decision. I've stuck it out for 6 years, and I'm 18 now. In two days, it'll be my ex's birthday. I get to see her turn 20, and then that's it. I have some prescription stuff to break up the monotony of the over-the-counter painkillers. My liver will fail in a week. I'm finally looking forward to something.To mods, sorry if this violates the pro-suicide post rule, along with explicit discussion of it. For once, I need someone to know what I am, what I've done, without hiding it in lies. Delete this if you will, I'll be deleting myself soon anyway."
I need to be institutionalize,"im going fucking crazy
im literally thinking about fucking murdering someone and fucking killing myself after
i'm fucking rocking back and forth
someone come and just put me out of my misery "
i just want to get better,"but i dont know how, i'm scared and alone and anxious and constantly reminded i'm covered in scars because i'm a dumbfuckeverything seems like such a struggle, i can't even motivate myself to waste time, i just do nothing except for occaisonal houseworki don't even have the self-esteem fallback of being good at anything or having a hobby, i just have nothing, it's really hard to even get out of bed, i spent the entire day in bed yesterday rotating between bad dreams fueling my anxieties and crying whenever i was awakeit's really hard to not just do something.. irreversibly stupid, i get antsy helping with food prep and being around sharp knivesi'm not qualified for anything, i feel like i'm too stupid for anything, i don't have the drive of ""i want to do "", i've got severe anxiety and everything's so scaryall my online friends that are better than me just constantly come to me ""hey im so worthless and sad and i can't do anything"" and they've selftaught like an entire language or are exceptionally skilled at their hobbies or this and moreand i just don't have anything, i'm 21 & failed highschool and haven't done anything since except mooch off my parents that put up with me for some reason and probably annoy everyone i talk to because i'm worthless and depressedhad a really shitty episode last night and just deactivated all my accounts and removed everyone except my distance gf because again i'm a dumbfuck even though i promised i wouldn't do this again i didsomeone basically just said to me ""stop being depressed you have a gf you have no reason to be sad"" and i think it just broke something in me i've been feeling like shit ever sinceit's so hard to not just give upi just want to be even semi functional and live somewhere quiet with the person i adorei don't want to think about suicide constantly at the drop of a hati don't want to be anxious around sharp things because it's so easy to relapsei feel broken compared to everyone else i've ever met and it sucksthis post sucks and so do i and im not even sure why i posted"
Killing myself is really the smart thing to do.,Since becoming disabled I have lost all will to live. I used to enjoy getting up every morning now I wake up disappointed that I did not die in my sleep.I have nothing to live for anymore. Nothing to look forward to. No version of the future interest me. I just want to die. Death frees me from having to experience life as a disabled person. I see no reason to continue living since there is nothing left for me to do that I want to do.I just to want to be here. The combination of having a future to look forward to and having to experience life in a wheelchair is enough for me to want to check out.
Guys how am i gonna fucking keep living,"i am so scared of actually killing myself and i'm scared that what's happening is all some fucking test and it's gonna be over soon but i'm gonna kill myself conveniently the day this fucking test is over and i fucking ruined my chance of happiness
im so scared but im so miserable "
"It hurts to see my friends and roommates go and have fun without inviting me, then lying to me about it","I have been on and off depressed for the most part of 3 years, and tried to commit suicide 2 years ago. I don't know what to do, and how to not take this personally. They do it all the time and verbally abuse me. Any help?"
I don't want to be a burden,"I went to the mental hospital this summer. Spent the better part of a month there, in fact. I finally told the truth to my psychiatrist and was sent there.  It wasn't a bad place really, but I'm pretty sure i just got lucky with a really good hospital. They experimented with medications there and there were a bunch of groups to go to. Hell, I think I even almost made a couple of friends. Almost.  I'm out now. I'm still very depressed and anxious... in fact, I'm more depressed I think then I've ever been. I can't enjoy things anymore. Not a day goes by where I don't feel sad and not an hour goes by without a thought of suicide. I don't know what to do. I guess the meds I'm on aren't working or something?  I just don't want to be a burden. The doctors and my family were so happy when I left the hospital and now I'm in a worse place than when I first went there. I want to kill myself... and I'm just lonely. I have no friends or meaningful relationships with other people. I have crippling social anxiety and have given up on talking to people.  I just want to give up now. If that experience couldn't help me, what can? I'm trying to be healthy. I really am. I go on walks everyday to get out, I brush my teeth and shower, I take my meds... but none of it is changing how I feel. I guess the best way to describe how I feel is I want to give up. On everything. I just want to curl up and die or do nothing. I sleep way too much... 12+ hours a day. Just so I can avoid being awake.  Now this is just turning into a stupid rant, fucking great. Great. I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to tell my parents if I feel like this... we talked a lot about ""communication"" at the hospital. But I can't. I just can't. I don't want to tell anyone, except anonymous strangers on the Internet who will forget me a few minutes after they read this post. Hilarious, huh?  I'm starting school soon and I'll miss it if I go back to the hospital. I'm scared if I tell anyone how I feel I'll get sent to a bad hospital where I'll be miserable. I just... don't know what to do. I am miserable everyday anyways.  I guess a person to chat with would be nice ? I'm really lonely and talk to myself too much. I am bad at following up on replying but I'll try. or does anyone have advice for the comments? What do I do??!?!? There is just too much. I'm 17 and way behind everyone else my age. Gah this is another stupid rant. I wish I was dead."
Best way to commit suicide and not discover my body?,"I just want to end it and cause minimal harm to my family. I dont want them to find my body because this is just traumatic, hell it would be great if they didn't even know I was dead and just went missing.��My plan so far is to shoot myself in the head in the middle of a lake with a weight tied to my foot, that way there's is 100% success rate (if the bullet doesn't kill me drowning will) AND my body will sink so nobody will be traumatized by finding it. I will just disappear :)��Just wondering if anybody had any better ideas��(p.s. PLEASE don't try to convince me not to, I've heard it all before and it wont help. I have no idea why everybody is so opposed to death, hell its probably just like what it was like before I was born - nothing - and compared to the pathetic life I live that sounds great to me. Ive thought about it for a while and I'm doing it. And who say I'm a selfish asshole, your right! Please help me cause less damage to my family so I can be less of an asshole.)"
I am having the worst night of my entire life,i've never wanted to kill myself more EVER then I do right now but i'm DUMB and Im hoping you'd get back together with me again
Youll never actually give a fuck,We started talking again and you decide to ghost me out of nowhere? At least let me know. Fucked over again and again. Think I'm gonna go lay on the railroad tracks until a train hits me or I get up and go back to my apartment.It's always some other guy. I'm just your filler. Fuck you.Please don't respond to this post. I'm just trying to vent.
worried I might do something drastic,"Currently recovering from a panic attack I had about an hour ago. I still live with my mom. Basically, I left her a note telling her that she didn't have to do my laundry anymore, because I'm already enough of a burden. (I didn't mention that part in the note.) She bursts into my room at 1am and starts crying and saying that I shouldn't be so mean?? I was confused and didn't say anything, and she left. About 5 minutes later she runs in again, YELLING at the top of her lungs about how she's never doing anything for me ever again and I shouldn't ask her to. I don't know how I possibly could have offended her. I thought I was being nice and responsible but I guess not. Long story short I almost overdosed. I took about 4 pills before I stopped myself. I still kind of want to take the rest. As of now I've lost everyone that I ever cared about. I can't face my mother in the morning. I don't know what to do. Falling asleep and never waking up seems like a good solution. "
"11 years of fighting depression, I think I've about had enough.","Depression hit me hard 11 years ago and I've been on a slow path to recovery, or so I thought. Somehow it's relapsed this years and it's as worse as it's ever been. I'm on the verge of divorce, my true love is out there waiting for me but I can't be with her. So I will end up with no one when this is all over. I'm losing my house, my marriage, I have no friends, my family is unsupportive, and I'd rather live on the streets than go back living with them. The one thing I want that could save me and make life worth living is the one person I consider my true love. Except she's taken and she has largely withdrawn herself from me. So when it's all said and done, I'll have nothing, no one. I am 34 and my depression started when I was 23. I held on because I was convinced it would get better. It started to but then it got worse again. I just don't have the strength to continue anymore. As soon as I figure out the best way to end it I probably will."
I want to die because I have HIV,"I'm a drug free, 20 year old straight white male from the United States who has only had sex with 5 girls, 2 of which were long term relationships. The probability of me contracting HIV was extremely low. I don't understand how I could be so unlucky. 2 tests were positive. Everything I aspired to do in my life requires a HIV - status. I want to serve in the french foreign legion. I want to obtain another passport which would've been done through the FFL, most countries will not accept HIV + people for naturalization. I had interest in trying to start a Private Military/Security company that specialized in many sectors including humanitarian relief after my time in the service. I'm very well versed in international relations. BUT I can't do any of that with an HIV + status. Literally all of my goals and dreams have been crushed. I don't want to live like this. Every time I read and research things that interest me I just feel sick to my stomach because I can't live that life. Did you know that a secret society accidentally contributed to the start WW1 by one of its members assassinating The Duke of Austria? Did you know that white Rhodesian soldiers of the Selous Scouts during the Rhodesian bush war painted themselves black because killing a white soldier was considered a ""delicacy"", the black paint also helped camouflaged them in the 'Bush'. I can tell you all about an ak47, Cold War soviet cargo planes, the famous mil mi8 helicopter, Viktor Bout, blood diamonds, colonial Africa, Jordanian intelligence agencies, why Pakistan covers for the taliban and why they're hiding a Indian organized crime lord... and so so much more but all the information is useless to me if I can't use it.I don't want to die but I don't want to live with HIV... everything is complicated with it. From relationships to my career. I don't want to live like this. "
One day before I hit my 30s...,"Not sure where to begin with. I'm laying in bed and I'm crying like I have for the past few years, it's not an every day occurrence that I cry myself to sleep but it happens often enough. I'm at my wit's end with life and I'm still in my early-mid 20s, but I decided to end my life before I will reach 30. I kept thinking for the past few days what is the best way to go out, and I think the quickest and least painful way (hopefully) is with a gun. It's not easy to get a gun where I'm from but it's doable. I've nothing worthy to live for. I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm a lone-wolf, I'm a horrible person and I drive everyone around me away. I've been succumbing to depression for close to 10 years now and I've had enough. I can't take this pain anymore and truthfully no one gives a flying fuck about me. That's the truth. I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm frustrated and I just want to be laid to rest in my eternal sleep. I don't know why I wrote this, I guess I needed a place to write something down. One person made me happy and that person is gone, I pushed her away, with my shitty attitude and my clinginess and I smothered her. Never gave her room to breath and I regret that now so much. Oh. Did i mention I'm ugly? Yeah... also one of the reasons. I miss you E, I hope you know I deeply love you. Buenas noches everyone. "
In the Beginning,"I remember (I told myself to remember) I took a mental snapshot of my world when I was 4 years old: Cold, hard and grey like the concrete around me on a freezing overcast winters morning.I always keep it close to me.The pigeons looked forlorn, dismal and hopeless that day, but on reflection... maybe that was me.I felt worthless that day.Granny gave me gloves with her caring eyes one cold winters morning.I saw her walk around a corner and disappear. I felt so deeply sad and lost.I saw her lying in blood with a broken neck - she was battling to breathe.I had nightmares about her.I looked into her eyes when she was in hospital. I saw... I looked briefly into her sad, deep eyes, and she peered back into mine. I felt my gaze too inadequate for her - like she needed more, like she wanted to hold a conversation with me too deep for words... like she wanted to tell me something.I was too small inside, so I looked away.I was whisked away and before I knew it she was gone...I was gone with her.Lots of intense stuff has happened since then but that was one of the first times I felt really bad.I'm so sorry to all of you who suffer. No matter what it is you're going through I'm really sorry. We have to try hold on. When the storm rolls in and dread and despair grips a hold of us its so important to hold on to something - a belief, a hope, a vision, a love. Don't give in. Hold on tight. Don't let go."
Is my classmate suicidal or is it just a sick sense of humor?,"In English class I sit next to a boy I met at the beginning of the school year. We're both 16 and juniors. He's really funny, we talk a lot, and I would consider us class friends. He often says little things like ""kill me,"" and ""I'm going to kill myself"", which alone isn't concerning because some people just say those things randomly. Today he got in trouble for drawing a dick on his desk. We were walking out of class together and he started talking about how he draws dicks everywhere. I half-jokingly said, ""are you okay?"" And he responded ""no I'm not"", also in a joking manner. Then he said he draws dicks everywhere because he ""wants to leave  the school a gift before he kills himself."" He says this all as a joke, but I feel like someone who talks about suicide this often isn't really joking. Some other things about him are
he has ADHD and seems kind of weird if you don't know him. He told me he wasn't going to homecoming (which everyone at my school goes to) and if he did, he would just show up in his pajamas. Sometimes he makes jokes about shooting up the school too. I also like him, and maybe I'm just taking things out of context because I care about him.Are these things a warning signs? I don't have much perspective as Ive never been suicidal or known someone suicidal(to my knowledge). Should I do anything or just ignore it? I don't want to overreact to a joke but I also don't want to regret not doing anything if he hurts himself. "
I have found a place to take my life,"It has genuine significance to me, a park bench that I hung out with the girl I've been in love with for over ten years last. I think its a very memorable place to do the deed but I am not sure how. I do not have access to a gun so does anybody have any ideas? Been brainstorming with hanging, there is a tree right beside the bench so I guess I could hang myself there."
I just want to feel like someone cares the way I do,"It's been years since I felt like I was someone's top priority. I'm 21 years old, in college, should be having the time of my life but it just seems like I don't matter to anyone. Everyone I try to get close to just doesn't show the same concern, the same care back. People I consider my closest friends know I'm in a rut, and yet nobody calls to check on my like I do, nobody seems to wonder if I'm ok or if I need help.My past few girlfriends have legitimately left me for other guys. One texting me as we speak telling me about how she left me because she likes his voice better. Like am I actually that bad of a person that I can be replaced by someone with a better voice? My own family doesn't seem the slightest concerned with me being the way I am. I've tried to talk to them about what I'm struggling with and I get responses like ""You just got to get it together"" and ""It's not that hard to get up and get moving"". I just don't know what's wrong with me that I'm not a priority to anyone. I know that people say there's always someone that cares, and I know that. I just want back what I put out. I want someone to talk to me first, someone to ask me to go somewhere, someone that just wants to be around me because they like to. But I'm not good enough, and I don't know what to change to be that for someone. Anyways today was my breaking point. I don't know how much longer I can do it. I go to work and class with a mask on because everyone wants to be entertained, not stressed by some depressed loner. I'm tired of acting happy. It doesn't matter anyways because nobody would change a thing if they saw I wasn't happy."
Screw everyone who has very stopped me from killing myself!,"Seriously, I have had serious mental health issues since I was six. Every freaking thing. I've heard voices, I rip out my hair, my skin, I just hate this. I have attempted suicide many times. SO far, I have been stopped. And, I am so mad about this. Yes, they had good intentions, but it doesn't make up for what they did. I am tired of suffering. This never ends."
I just can't take the disappointment anymore...,"I've always been a good student, but last year I started studying engineering and I realized how depressed I was. I started slacking on school work, procrastinating, and my GPA sucked. I took this semester off to get help, but I'm so embarrassed and my parents don't take my depression seriously.I am taking calculus and I have an exam tomorrow that I didn't study for and I know I am not going to do well, and I just can't do this anymore. I'm so tired of being such a failure and such a disappointment. I hate myself for being sick and for disappointing my parents like this. I just want to die in my sleep so that I can be free and not have to worry about school anymore. "
"I'm ""in love"" with somebody who doesn't know I exist, and even if she did, I'm pretty sure she wouldn't love me the way I need her to.","I don't really know how to explain what I mean, but the feelings I have for her aren't romantic in any way. She's married, and that doesn't bother me in the slightest, as I have no desire whatsoever to have that sort of relationship with her. But I love her deeply on a platonic, spiritual level. Though I've never spoken to her, I feel such a connection to her through her writing. Other than that, I can't say what it is about me that makes me love her so much. But all I can think about is her loving me back. I so badly would love to have a mentor-mentee or mother-daughter kind of relationship with her, and I don't know why. I don't know why I crave a motherly figure (or why specifically this woman) as I have a wonderful relationship with my own mother and love her more than anybody in the world. But some part of me, on some level desires this woman's affection. I don't think I will ever be at peace until she knows me by name, considers me a friend, and has held me in her arms at least once.I can't tell anyone about my feelings lest they consider me a freak. I know I am. I'm a fucked up, weird person who doesn't even deserve to be alive, and I know my dreams will never become a reality. Even if I do get to know this lady, I don't expect things will work out the way I'm hoping they will. I'm quickly losing hope, weight, and the desire to live. I'm like a walking vegetable, completely devoid of any substance. All I do is cry and make myself sick over not being able to have the love that I want more than anything. I don't know how I can go on like this. I'm tired of feeling sad and worthless. "
"This is the 2. Girl that breaks up with me, bc Im depressed","Im not designed to be loved, or be alive.I have to face the facts i Will be depressed the rest of my life, tonight i will take all my pills, you Got 1 more day to surprise me, World."
"Life cheated on me, It's been 5/6 weeks now and I feel suicidal","So, Look back at my posts to see the story....
I've been doing fine up until this last week, It's now hit me really hard, I'm losing my whole life and I feel so alone! Divorce is the worst and I can't cope! I just want my life to end! "
i have nothing to live for,"I have nothing worth living for anymore. My family and 2 friends just aren't enough anymore. I know if I did it they would be hurt, but they'd soon get over it. I'm nothing special. I'm unbelievably forgettable and replaceable. School does nothing for me, and is honestly a waste of my limited time. I see a future of despair and loneliness, and a degree isn't going to fix it. And yeah, things might get better at some point, but I don't think I can wait for that. Things now are too bad, and any reprieve that I may get in the future wont last. So I might as well end the cycle. "
I don't know why I'm still here,"17 y/o male, High school senior, living with my parents and no siblings. Recently I've come to have lost all of my self esteem. I really don't know what I'm good and and what my purpose will ever be society. I get occasional severe depression, causing me to avoid social interactions and meetings with the closest of friends. I find myself extremely awkward and notice how people get uncomfortable around me. Lots of people I know think I'm decently attractive but my lack of social skills has come to my detriment when it comes to woman. All of my friends are super successful students that are most likely going to ivy leagues, have excellent social lives and are good with woman. My recent homecoming dance really made me realize how far I had drifted from the rest of my friends when it comes to social interaction and friendship. I know my friends and family care about me a lot but I find it hard to understand why a lot of times. I've brought up suicide with my dad a few occasions but he's never taken me seriously. This homecoming dance really pushed me over the edge and I've been considering it more than ever now. I don't know what to do with myselfThe only things still keep me going are listening to Frank Ocean and going to the gym"
���I bear the wounds of all the battles I avoided.�۝,Can anybody relate to this?Quote by Fernando Pessoa
give me one reason why i shouldnt cut my throat open,"no one desires me, i am a living joke.and no one hides that from me.I am so angry..."
How does it feel to drown?,"Is it relaxing? Or is it desesperating, like in movies? Have any of you experienced it?"
bleh,"I'm just done here. I wish voluntary euthanasia was a thing and it was available for anyone. It will never happen because the powers that be get nothing out of it, and lets be honest a metric fuck ton of people would be out of here and cause society to be even less stable.
But it should still be a thing. Society is embracing more freedom to choose; eg gender stereotypes and all that. Well, I say how about existential freedom. Why can't we choose to leave without an excruciating method.I had a gf for 6 months that was like morphine for my life. She took the edge off. (I still had no desire to live though.) But no more. Now she has a new guy and though I'm objectively aware of my expendability, I'm really feeling it now.My half assed idea for work is to work in a bicycle shop, but even that is effort and I'm a very slow person and I'd have to deal with people. I'd just as easily take a painless method out instead."
"I don't want people to say if only we had known, or if only we could have done something.","I've seen people's reactions to suicide plenty of times throughout the last three years unfortunately and the family and friends often say thing's that make me wonder if what they are saying is really the truth.  If/when I kill myself what will the reactions be, will they say 'if only we had known' or 'if only we could have done something' because the reality is if you genuinely knew me, you would know and you would have had many opportunities to help, so I guess what I'm saying is, you clearly have priorities in life which is fine, we all do but at the very least please don't pretend you did everything you could and that I was the number one priority in your life or that you didn't know how bad I really was.You don't owe me anything at all, but please don't try to create lies in order for my death to have been seen as unexpected or preventable if only you had known, in order to justify me not being a big priority in your life until I'm dead and you need to explain to people why I did it and the circumstances around it."
What's a useless man's reason to still walk this damnable planet?,"I'm serious about that question. I mean, have you ever just dumped your all into something, only to realise you really just can't do it? I hope you didn't. But I did. Countless times. My whole life, really. It didn't take me long to realise my body is too weak and sluggish for any type of sport. But I kept looking for things to do with my life, over and over. And eventually I found games. Some might have called me an addict, and though I've always denied the possibility, now I'm not so certain. But that's not what this rant is about. I just played video games all day, every day. I sank hundreds of hours in them. Skyrim, Neverwinter, The Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, Civ 5, Warface, Paladins, Overwatch, League of Legends, and I can continue that list for hours. But no matter how many hours I sank in whatever game, no matter how hard I tried, I always failed. Smite was the prime example. I'm bound to have most of my playtime in that game. And I've been playing and playing, and with every character I failed, and after every match I told myself: ""Hey, that's fine. This match didn't go well. You're not good with this character. Oh well, there are more than 80 in the game, you'll find yours one day."" But now, after match number seventy-thousand-and-something-else I finally gave up. No matter what I do in my life, I fail. I have been useless and depressed for enough years to realise I'm not going to be good at anything, ever. A wise person once told me to not give things your full 100% all the time. ""Keep a steady 75% on. It makes people underestimate you, so you can always impress them when you want. Besides, too much stress isn't good for you. That's why I wouldn't want a job that needs my full 100% all the time. It's way better doing nicely at the 75."" But for that to be true, that 100% needs to even be something. And I can tell you, my 100% is your 2%.
So back to the question in the title. I have tried to do almost everything. And no matter what, I failed miserably. I can't run, I can't lift books, I can't play soccer, I can't play tennis, I can't play FPS games, MOBA's, RTS'ses, I can't write stories, play a piano, or a guitar, anything. So why am I still here? I only KNOW about 5 people, and I'm definitely not ""contributing anything to society"" and I won't be missed by anyone if I go, unlike what all those posts on suicide say. I've been living the same story for years now, and I'm bored. Tired. I don't want to fail for the umpteenth time. So why would a person like me not commit suicide? What the hell is my reason to be here anymore?"
Bla bla bla. Another one.,"Just another sad shit in a long line of sad shits here. Nothing too special I suppose. I want to kill myself daily. I sabotage good things. Ive been barely able to hold a job longer then a couple of months. I absolutely fucking despise myself. Im only alive because of family and friends. None of them understand, none of them care to ask honestly. Ive told them all how I feel, and yet all I've gotten is the same old one liners and advice that basically sums up to ""Your on your own, only you can fix you"" bullshit.I dont eat, both inability to purchase food and inability to choose food over cigarettes when i have 3 or 4 dollars to my name. I eat about once every 2 days. now days. 5'11"" and im down to 120-something lbs. I really don't know how much longer I'll last before I throw myself off my 11th floor balcony."
crappy birthday to me...,"so my birthday is almost over, it was supposed to help me forget the bullshit ive been going through lately but so far ive been cheated on, i crashed my car and im getting evicted... not to mention that i don't even have any money to go out to the bar and have a fucking drink with because the cheating bitch stole it.i just want a hug _���"
I don't feel like anything good is ever going to happen.,"How could it? I just don't think I'm meant to feel better. I am just not meant to be who I want to be. I'll get to be 28 (the arbitrary age I've set for myself to achieve the kind of success I want) and I'll have nothing to show for it but what a washed-up, talentless loser I am. So what's the point "
Goodbye friend,"My friend was taken off life support a couple days ago. OD on some synthetic opiates. Ever since then I've felt sick to my stomach seeing his family on facebook. I don't have any energy and just wanna quit my job and quit school. The last few years of my life have already been just real dull. The only thing keeping me going is a new girl at work who seems interested in me, but to her I'm just some normal guy she has no idea how depressed I am and I'm scared to get close to her. Imagining her finding out makes me even more scared. Imagining that there's a good chance she won't be around to cheer me up in the future because I'll inevitably ruin things is the worst of all. Without her I really don't know what would motivate me. But she is all I look forward to. Just getting to go to work, see her, and laugh together. I'm not good with relationships and don't know how to progress things without ruining the one thing that makes me happy.I got off topic a bit I guess. These past few nights it's been especially hard to fall asleep. I keep thinking of my friend dying especially since we're so young. I keep thinking how he must have felt when it was happening. I wonder if he knew he was dying. I wonder if he knew he was in a coma on life support. I wonder if he's in a better place now.I'm sorry I'm ranting i have no one to talk too about any of this. I really just don't know what to do with myself anymore."
Cried for the first time in a decade.,"Sitting here spending the 10,220th night alone. I cannot take this for much longer. I started therapy 3 months ago and I have been told that THEY are stuck. I am sure someone here, if they read this, will say that I need to find a new therapist/psychiatrist. But what is the point? I'm so broken that I need to shop around for someone to tell me life is worth living?I have had some trauma in my life but I seriously cannot seem to do more than the bare minimum. I eat 1-2 times a day. Sometimes I drink 7 days a week. Usually not to get trashed, but it burns some time after work before I have to avoid my roommates until I fall asleep. Rinse and repeat the next day.My family adores me and would be just as proud if I cleaned a gutter then if I was a senator. I have a support group that cries and pleads to me to be happy and accept them. Can't do it.I have pushed all of my friends away to the point of ""have you thought about therapy?"" and romantic relationships have never been possible. I broke up with my first gf at age 13 because I couldn't handle being told she loved me. The two since then have been even worse. I've never been assaulted. I've never wanted for anything. I would trade my life if I could as I can't make anything of what I have.  Had to tell someone, might as well be reddit. "
I just lost my last friend because I thought I was helping.,"This all happened a few hours ago and I really don't know what to do.  I messed up really bad.  My friend was a little high and decided to meet a guy at a church near her house so she had me on the phone to call the cops if anything went wrong.  She already told me she didn't trust the guy.  She told me if she doesn't call me in 30 minutes to call the police, I gave her 50 minutes because I figured her phone may have died but I was worried about her and called anyway.  She eventually did call me to let me know she was okay so I called the police station back and told them the same.  Well they ended up going to her house anyway to check on her.  I guess the police found her high and drinking underage. I can only assume she's in a ton a trouble all because of me. She called me around fifteen minutes ago to tell me that her life was over and she was never going to talk to me again.  I've never been in a situation like this and I don't think I can live with ruining someone's life like this.  I thought I was helping.  I tried talking to the suicide prevention hotline a few minutes ago and he put me on hold multiple times and just told me it was her fault but I know it's not all on her.  I feel so helpless now.  How do you recover from knowing you ruined someone's life?  I just ruined my own life too.  I wish I had just slept through her phone calls tonight.  Somebody please help me because this seems like the type of thing that I'll never be able to get over.  "
I wanna die,I just can't deal with living without her. Please If anyone can reach out and talk please help me.
My biggest regret right now is that I didn't go through with it.,"I didn't have a suicide attempt like a lot of people.  But I had plans. When, how, why, and what would happen after. I ended up not because I was told things would get better and they did, for awhile. I have a 1 year old baby girl and I love her to pieces. The mother I love too, but we are having issues right now. I don't have hope this or anything else will work out and get better. I should be gone and not have to deal with this anymore. I am tired of failing.
 I wish I was gone before my daughter's birth, that way she wouldn't be my reason to stick around right now."
"If it wasn't for my kids and my immediately family, I would probably kill myself how I feel right now","I spend my life looking after everyone. I am a lone father to 2 girls I love dearly, I work 2 jobs caring for disabled adults and disabled kids, I literally spend my life caring for other people, on the surface i laugh and joke...But inside. I've been depressed my entire life. I find it hard to cope with little things. I live in a state of constant anxiety that has seen me fail at my dream of beginning a teacher (I can't pass this times test, I am fully competent to teach but cannot answer complex maths questions in 30 seconds so lol)I have a girlfriend who I do love to bits, but she's pretty selfish, e.g. I'll try and talk about the stress of looking after my daughter who has aspergers and mental health issues and she starts going on about how well her daughter is doing in school..she literally never asks how I am. I get really anxious about things, my neighbours have moved out and said a young couple are moving in. Knowing this is the sort of thing that makes me extremely anxious (I'm imagining terrible neighbours with banging music etc), my girlfriend commented ""they are bound to be the worst"" I just think why be such a jerk and make me feel bad about stuff. I feel very alone.I hate how I look. I have horrible teeth and I'm overweight, I smoke like a chimney and obsess about dying so want to stop smoking but feel so stressed I smoke more.Everything just seems bleak. I'm sure if it wasn't for not wanting to hurt my family, id have killed myself to end the constant pain I live with."
"Alone, tired and ready to leave","It's finally gotten to the point of no return. Distractions don't work, no one wants anything to do with me. I thought I'd be able to take this on by myself, but I've come to realize how important outside support is. Well, that train left a long time ago, so now I've pushed everyone away. I'm thinking maybe if I post this I might feel a bit better but while writing I just feel worse. Sorry for the annoyance , hope I can get this over with before I witness more people in my life cut ties with me."
Feeling so alone..,"I feel so fucking alone. I feel that I have to put a click bait title to get any comfort in this world. People tell me to go get help.. I try.. no one cares.. I can't tell my parents about my depression and suicidal thoughts because they don't even believe that I have severe anxiety issues.. years ago when I told my father I wanted to kill myself he just slapped me. Then I did the whole go to my room and cry my eyes out. Then he comes in the room with a knife. To ""help"" me commit suicide. What kind of fucking parenting tactic is that? He genuinely thought that was going to help. It's only helped me to keep any real problems away from his ears. I can't tell my boyfriend my problems because he has his own mental issues.. I have to be the strong one in the relationship.. I refuse to bring my problems up to him. I have no friends. They're all gone, except for one trying to crawl back in my life after the way she treated me.I have trust issues now as well, so I don't even talk about this stuff unless it's with strangers online or some online friend I happen to get close to for weeks then disappear. "
Buckshot or slug?,"Do you guys think I should commit suicide using a shell of buckshot, or a slug, assuming it is a 12 guage. I just want to end it instandly and painlessly."
I'm torn between wanting to live and wanting to die.,"better to live. at least until you're 27 and you can join the club.(seriously though, whats up?)"
The girl I've been obsessed with the past 8 months is a lesbian. Probably.,"First of all, I apologize for how long this is. Without getting too much into it, all factors considered, there's a really good chance the girl I was crazy over is a lesbian. And I'm still clinging to that small chance of it not being true like there's no tomorrow. I've never wanted to die more badly in my entire life. Around the beginning of last year, me and this girl created a study group for law school because we were pretty much the only two people without partners. I was so happy to see her everyday. The smiles, laughs, and locking eyes were my sole source of happiness for that entire semester. This, in turn, caused me huge amounts of anxiety. I was always worried that when I saw her, the exchange would be colder than the last time, and I would go home feeling miserable. This anxiety took a lot of my focus away from school. My grades were considerably lower than my first semester. This continued into the summer, where I didn't see her as much since she was working. However, since I shared an office with her roommate, we still got to hang out occasionally. The anxiety also transferred to her roommate, where I was always terrified the conversation between us would end up discussing this girl's relationship status. At this point, I realized that I'm in constant pain over this girl, and I didn't know what to do about it. I seriously considered and planned suicide several times. I even gave $100 to a homeless man because I was sure that I was going to hang myself that day, but I didn't end up having the courage to hang myself. When summer ended and school started again, I started to see her a lot more regularly, and I realized I had to do something to stop this pain, or else my career would severely suffer for it. My plan was as follows:
Step 1: Briefly get over her (I've tried to get over her before, but I've only been able to do so fleetingly. After that, I'll hear a song or something that reminds me of her, and the feelings return.)Step 2: While still in the midst of not caring about her, text her roommate and ask if she's single. I'm a lot closer with her roommate, so I feel like this way I could avoid the embarrassment that would come by asking her directly. I sit beside her in class, so it would make things really awkward if I told her directly. Having this plan, I enjoyed my weekend for the first time in awhile. I went and saw IT with some friends, and felt a small amount of happiness. However, the next morning, via some snooping on facebook, I discovered that it's very likely she's in a relationship with another woman. This completely blindsided me. She might not have even had the  to like me. I had no idea this was a possiblity. Suddenly, every conversation I've ever had with her has entered my mind as evidence in a sort of courtroom trial (habit of the profession, I suppose) of whether or not she's really a lesbian. What's worse is that I had just started therapy at my school's counseling center and I was looking forward to getting help for my depression. My 2nd meeting was scheduled this week, but was cancelled and postponed for 2 weeks. Additionally, I worry that my therapist, as a gay man, would assume that I'm homophobic if I told him this. So as a last resort, I talked to my roommate about it. I never talk to anyone about my problems, but I've never felt this low in my entire life, so I severely needed someone to talk to. My roommate was supportive, but her position was more of ""She's probably not, just ask her!"" rather than helping me get past the denial stage. However, I sat on the porch talking with her for a couple of hours, and she stayed and listened, which I greatly appreciated. I really didn't want to leave, but I could tell that after awhile she was getting tired, so I eventually left. Now that I was alone, this is when the absolute terror started kicking in.I tried to do my reading for the week. I could not. I can't think of law without thinking of her. I can't listen to any music because it reminds me of her. I can't eat anything because I'll think of a time when I ate that food around her. I've lost 10 pounds since last Sunday. I get about 2 hrs of sleep a night. I managed to go to school every day this week, but I absorbed nothing and was embarrassed to death on a cold call by a professor I respect. All I can do is lay catatonic in bed, because thinking about anything is too much. All thoughts eventually lead to the inescapable truth: When this girl's eyes lit up when I walked in the room, when she locked eyes at me and smiled and laughed, when she told me how much she missed me when she was away, when she told me good luck before every interview I had. All those feelings that I thought this person had for me were a complete illusion. I feel like such a bad person for having this problem. I'm miserable because someone else might be in a happy relationship. I almost feel like this is the Universe's way of punishing me for fetishizing lesbians all these years. I'm really sorry to get into this disgusting bit of detail, but when it becomes a routine to watch a particular kind of pornography, it really fucks with your head when that area of pleasure in your brain becomes so intrinsically associated with such a painful memory. At this point, I really don't think I can even continue with law school. I've never felt the burn-out other law students describe. I've always felt like one of the best parts of my life was my career. But now, it's been completely tainted by her. I never want to see a case brief again. It feels like everything I knew about the world is completely different. Reality is falling apart. Days and nights blend together. The only thing I've been doing to help ease my mind is researching suicide. I'm living in a world that doesn't make sense, so I need to go to another world immediately, even if that world is nothingness. Whereas with previous suicide attempts I've always stopped because I was afraid of the pain, I don't think that will stop me this time. I'm already in constant, physical agony with stomach pains that prevent me from eating anything. I'm more afraid of living than dying at this point. From my research it seems like all the painless methods out there have since been curtailed due to gov't regulation. I really don't think that will affect my decision at this point. I think I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get out of here. Anyway, thank you for your time."
It's All Too Much,"I can't do this anymore. I've tried many methods, but it never works. I just want to go to sleep and exist only in a perpetual nothingness. "
I'm literally jumping off,Aiming for the head
"lost everything within a week, house, wife, kids. job sucks regularly, overworked and underpaid and sleeping in a warehouse. my whole world just fell apart. i want to leave this shit life but i care about others too much to do it","Hey man. I can't speak to your experiences as you are further long the path of life than I am. I won't offer you any advice, I don't want to offend either your intelligence or experience. However, I will say things can get better if you make it happen. I wish you the best, please take care! "
I'm so close at this point,"I've been in pretty bad shape since high school, but the last three years (overwhelmingly since 2017 began) have been the worst. My will to continue to go on is stretched so thin. I have recently realized that I'm a ridiculous hypochondriac. Ironic, for someone who is suicidal, right? I'm truly not afraid of dying at all, but I am afraid of long term suffering or having to deal with surgical disfiguration or complications or something, I guess, even though the suffering wouldn't be long as it'd just prompt me to do it already. But these consistent thoughts that I'm always sick or have something wrong with me, to an extent which is true as I've had some minor to moderate health issue over and over since this year began, have basically left me a shell of who I used to be (as if that was anything in the first place). It has made me think it'd be so much better and easier if I just skipped ahead of all the worries and finished all those thoughts already, much faster and more easily. And then there's how life is actually going. I'm in college, which I've been miserable at since I got here. I'm 21 and the last three years have been truly some of the most miserable years of my life. Since going to college, I've lost all my friends from before college, whether just by losing touch or by going separate ways in terms of personality development, so they're all gone .I've made ""friends"" but not a single friend who could give the smallest ounce of a damn (aka the reason I'm sitting in my apartment on a Friday night instead of being out, like everyone I know is). Any time I have had any plans, with anyone, they've bailed, in one way or another. I have a couple of people who bring me a lot of joy, but I don't bring any joy to any single person on this earth, and that's a really big pain for me. I've never dated anyone. I haven't been able to really deeply care about anyone because I'm so dead and cold inside that there is no point.
All I do is go to work and class, eat (which I can't even enjoy as much anymore as I've had so many god damn gastrointestinal problems recently I can't even be comforted by it anymore), and go to bed.
I can't afford psychiatric help, so I am and always have been on my own. The very few people I've ever had a somewhat real conversation with have dismissed me as being melodramatic and depressing (always a great thing to hear!), and I haven't even bothered to be really open with them. I'm an American, but a lot of family lives abroad and I have to work very hard to send money back there because they need it, which at this point is the only thing that gives me some sense of fulfillment because it gives me the false sense that someone needs me, even though they only need me for the financial aspect. If I disappeared the only loss anyone would experience would be my paychecks, and oh boy does that cut deep. In every other aspect, I'm useless and unnecessary. I drink pretty often, which I know doesn't help, but it's the only thing that makes me feel good. If I go out, that's always going to be a good way to do it. I don't even want to feel sorry for myself. But I don't want to feel this way anymore and there's no sign of a resolution to it. I want to die so very much and I have so many ways I can do it, but I'm not doing it yet for some unidentifiable reason. But I don't know how long that unidentifiable force will be here. "
One more night...,"First time posting on any sub...here goes... So Im bipolar (diagnosed and untreated), Ive self medicated with opiates since the death of my mom who raised me. My parents divorced at ten, and both remarried abusive assholes who dont care about me. My dad wasnt bad, he just wasnt available. 4 days a month at his place and we never spent time together on those days anyways...back to mom...she was my world, my support, she made the best of every bad situation, and was always there. After having a nervous breakdown at mid 30s, she struggled with bipolar disorder and alcoholism for 18 years, then git sober, good medication regiment, divorced stepdad got a great boyfriend. Diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage 3b may 2011. She died 1 month after my wedding 10-1-11 of cancer. Ive been with my wife 6 years married, 15 years total this year. We have 2 sons (4 and 1 y.o.) We have struggled with through my substance abuse, 3 miscarriages, money problems and more jobs than I can recall. I cant hold a job; used to be able to for a few years at a time but now I work about 5 to 7 a year.  Just lost the best job Ive ever had (construction), and was simply told it wasnt a good fit... We have title loans, payday advances, credit cards, past due on all bills, all because I cant manage a job. I just cant do it. Just cant. I am 36 years old, have been surpassed by all my peers career-wise, Im tired man, like just bone weary of letting people down, and coming up short as a provider. The amount of resentment my wife has for me is staggering and I understand her position perfectly. This job was my last chance. This was it..... Tonight was gonna be the night. I know she and my boys would be fine (her parents are incredibly well off, but from humble beginnings /salt o' the earth types who have always treated me well.) My youngest asleep, I lay with my oldest in my bed, wife on her side with him in the middle, a literal ocean of time and distance between us, and was telling him bedtime stories .. We talked about heaven and how nice it will be to be there one day. It was a nice moment, a memory to take and I was ready...Beneath us is the garage where I have ready my car, a length of hose, duct tape, a pvc step down adapter, (homemade) for the tailpipe, note written and last will made (short considering all items Ive owned worth anything are long gone). The reason you are reading this now is because of something he said...after the last story, I kissed his forehead, said ""you are the best parts of me, you are my favorite person, and you are a good son."" He said, ""I know daddy, Im a good boy, Im good at school, I listen to my teacher, you are my best friend, and you will teach me to grow up, right?."" Those last 9 words fucking gutted me... I literally sat on the steps in the hall shaking and sobbing so loud and hyperventilating I ran outside so as not to wake anyone. That uncertainty of how his life will turn out is my greatest source of turmoil. I think he will be better without me, but what if? What if my wife gets with an abusive asshole and this chain comes full circle?... I was ready man, tonight was it, I have given it all I got, there is nothing more, its broken and lost and Im ok with that but I have to go...and tonight, if only for tonight, my son pushed me back. "
Tonight might be my last,All I do is hurt people the people I care about. I've always been like this and now I have nobody. A mean step mom who doesn't let me do anything social. I hate my life and I just want to die. Everyone would be better off with me gone. I just want to end it and I don't know how I should. I'll probably drink bleach but idk yet.
"Going to cut my wrists, life is nothing but drowning in agony for me","I have been suffering from severe depression and OCD my entire life in a third world country and have been the biggest target of school violence and bullying that I knowNothing has gotten better, not in the past 3 years nor ever... now I am among the worst students in my classroom, my mind barely functions because of the pain and boredom from braindead, shameless subjects that haven't helped anyone other than in showing off and making others miserable that they don't know the pointless stuff that that person knowsI am completely slow, clumsy and incompetent at least as compared to everyone else in my high school which is one of the hardest in the countryIt's infinitely easier to be cruel than to give the slightest bit of empathy, especially when a moron professor makes you the only one with an F in class right off the bat because you didn't show up one day... how sickening... absolutely revolting, and yet not even close to the atrocities that I live through in every school year, not even including my extreme social awkwardnessI can't go on, I am required to spend at least 7 hours a day studying or else I will be kicked out of school, when I can barely spend 2 hours... and that is just in the second year of high schoolMy mind can barely function because of the pain, I can't focus on anything... so much Is expected of me, for no reason and with 0 empathy or understanding whatsoever"
The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I don't want my mom and dad to go through having a dead kid and thinking that they failed me,Please let them know exactly that.
I just need someone to know what I've been through... I don't want it on my suicide note though. So here it is.,"I'm a 22 year old female and I feel like giving up. Here are my issues...My dad (who was my LIFE) died suddenly on Thanksgiving.Because of this, we got evicted from my childhood home.We could no longer afford to send me to the college of my dreams, but my mom opened up a bunch of credit cards in my name and made me believe I was going back to school next semester. So I had to scramble to find a school that would take me. My credit is ruined.I attempted suicide to be with my dad againAfter the suicide attempt, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophreniaI lost my pilot's license due to schizophrenia and not being able to pass the medical anymoreMy mom stole all my money for drugs My mom is pregnant and refuses to go see a doctor or anything and I'm worried about my future siblingI failed a class and had to switch majors.I finally got into the program of my dreams, only to get in a wreck and be taken to jail on count of DUI. The only good news is this case was dropped once they proved that I was NOT intoxicated while driving. However, I got kicked out of my program until the case was resolved. Then I went to re apply for the program but it was already full, even though I tried on the first dayThe car accident mentioned above knocked out 6 of my front teeth. I'm 22 and I have dentures.At my old job, the manager spent the entire time berating me and accusing me of lying and threatening me.I feel like I'm leaving stuff out, but that's the main point. Thanks for listening. I don't want this stuff on my suicide note because I don't want anybody to feel guilt. I know they will anyway, but all in all it's best if I just quit now..."
I just feel defeated...,"sometimes I don't know how to respond anymore.  I'm sad....and I know I need to work...but I feel like my life is worthless and everything else.
I want to live but at the same time I want to quickly escape. I want to sleep forever or bleed until I'm dry. I want others to live....I just don't want to have to put any more effort in. "
33 and deeply suicidal,"So, I'm 33 and, for easily the past 15 years, I've seen no worth in getting up in the morning. I started fantasizing about killing myself when I was ten years old. I'd walk around the elementary school where my mom works and imagine people finding me in different closets or alcoves. I was home schooled and didn't have any friends for most of my teenage life. Between the ages of 15 and 23, I literally didn't see anyone of my own age for months on end. I felt incredibly isolated, lost, scared, and worthless. I thought of suicide every day. In the past 23 years I've been in tons of therapy programs and have tried incredibly hard to grow myself as a person. I've tried to grow and learn to make friends. Every step of the way has been a struggle. I had to practice making eye contact, then practice shaking hands, then practice hugging, etc. I didn't have my first girlfriend until I was 27, my first job until I was 28, or get my driver's license until I was 29. I've never had sex or even done much beyond kissing with a girl. I'm afraid because I don't know what I'm doing. I grew up around women and I am afraid of disappointing them or making them feel pressured or uncomfortable. The women I'm drawn to are almost always conservative sexually, but eventually I know I have to be capable of living up to their expectations. When you're in your thirties, that's intimidating. Last year I fell in love with a women I worked with. I quit my job to be with her. We dated for six months and she broke up with me because I lost my job. I'm still jobless, almost three months later. I was in a car accident and have no car. I have rheumatoid arthritis and can't afford my medicine, so it's hard for me to walk or do any exercise. My girlfriend and I planned for a summer filled with trips and time together and instead I spent my summer alone, bedridden, broke, heartbroken and desperate. Nothing makes me happy and I have no one who loves me or wants to truly be with me. I've been in a combined 9 months of romantic relationships over the course of my entire life and both women left me and broke my heart. I have a master's degree but can never find a job that pays me a living wage. I'm in constant pain and my every waking moment is consumed by missing what I've lost. I feel like a hollow, immaterial thing. Like I'm already lost and exist in remnants only, like I'm light and insignificant enough to float away without detection. I genuinely feel like there's no point in going on. I've tried to kill myself twice before, with the most recent time being this time last year. That time, I ended up in the hospital and almost passed away. In each situation I felt overwhelmed to the point of panic. Suicide felt like something that was a solution to temporary lack of reason. Now I have a very logical, almost calming belief that there's really no point to going on. It's like the thought of quitting a bad job or anticipating the end of a bad experience. I intellectually believe that life - at least the one I have - is not worth living. I miss my girlfriend desperately. I gave up everything for her. She had issues too, and I gave everything I could to trying to help her, understand her and be there for her, even though it sometimes resulted in me feeling hurt, overlooked, and ignored. I believed in her, beyond any of her issues, but she didn't even believe in me beyond my current employment options. I can't do any better and I can't do any more. Every day when I go to sleep I plan to end my life the next day. It's the most encouraging thought I have as I drift off. I just needed to share. "
rant,"I want to die. I've wanted to die for years. I have nothing to give, and no one to share anything with. I want to die, and I want others to feel it. I've romanticized my death.I am a corpse shuffling about. Within this husk lies a still flickering passion for life, and a want for love and understanding. But I've died. I don't believe in myself, and I don't believe in others either.< end rant>"
Lonely,"What's the point in living when I will always be alone. I've never had a friend. Not one. I'm 20. My loneliness has had me depressed since I was 11. All I crave is love and friendship. My family doesn't even know me. No one cares to ask about me. Everyone just seems to want to talk about themselves so I just stopped talking about myself completely for years. For example I play a few instruments and they don't even know I'm into music at all. The thought of having someone else beside me or just to hang out, just seems so good to be true. No one will ever come to see me because they actually like me and care to see me. I even changed my looks dramatically to try and attract more people. Lost a ton of weight, got fit, got teeth straightened and whitened, started wearing makeup, made myself ""good looking"". No one cares. I try my best to smile most of the time and make eye contact with people (which was very hard for me because I have severe social anxiety). No one cares. My dog is the only one who seems genuinely happy to see me every single day. He's my best friend. My only friend. No one will ever show me the unconditional love he's shown me. But it isn't enough. I am always alone. No one to share my thoughts with but myself. I feel like I'm a prisoner in solitary confinement. I have a very strong urge to kill my self. Like tonight. I know it's an impulsive decision but it's very strong. I will never feel that love or connection with anyone. There is no point in living life alone. "
Suicidal and need to express this,"I have my reasons I want to die. Believe me, the reasons are sufficient. I don't want to talk about it because thinking or talking about the specifics makes me feel worse. I have chronic illnesses along with a host of other problems with my life circumstances. There is no hope for a better future. My parents don't understand how difficult it is for me to live. I tell them but they tell me maybe a miracle will make me better. I know this is not possible but they are in denial and insist God will help me. Of course, this is ridiculous. I want to die but I can't think of a reliable way. I'm so scared of failing and being in a situation where I can't even make an attempt again. I just needed to let this out. Thanks for reading, anyone out there. I wish the world was a fair and just place with a God etc. like my parents think it is. I know better."
tonight is the night i need a way to let my family know without hurting them,"I just have no will to live anymore I've lost everything
I can't go on suffering like a gaping wound  I plan to have a accident tonight. At least the life insurance will be left behind.
I need a way to let my family know I love them
I know it will hurt them but it won't be forever
I want them to know that my suffering is over and that I will be happy wherever I go on to next I know I will be happy
Should I leave a video ?i want them know I'm happy with my choice  A note won't sum it up "
Had enough of this life,"And I'm just done with it. Killing myself is only hard because I know my mother will be devastated. But I can't take it anymore, everything is shit and I feel empty and emotionless. Yeah, so, that's all."
Does anyone else feel like they NEED to be institutionalised?,"I often daydream about going to prison or (after another failed suicide attempt) being sent to some psychiatric health place. I think I'm attracted by the idea of being allowed to start from scratch. God knows that almost all of my suicidal urges come from a fear of the past, maybe that's why I struggle to see a future without wiping the slate clean and starting again. To lock myself away from drink and distractions, to be forced into a routine that, at first, I'll cynically protest and undermine (not in prison though) , only to come out as the stamp-approved normal person that I've always wanted to be, forced into it because I have no recourse in browsing reddit or playing video games or getting drunk to spend my time.But then I'm scared because I know when I come out it'll be so hard to  fall into the old routines. I want to be put away somewhere for so long that I am broken, my black dog to be put down, like a quarantine for the soul.Apologies for the ramble, somewhat drunk but have no access atm to anything i could kill myself with"
I'm lost and empty and sad and I don't know where to turn. I need Hope.,"The void is growing bigger. It used to hit in waves but now it�۪s always there, ever present and unrelenting. It pulls me towards the emptiness like a flame draws a moth. The Emptiness. The knowledge that nothing lasts forever used to give me hope. Hope was all that I had to keep me going. This can�۪t last forever right? Nothing can! But that�۪s not where I stand today. Today I stand at the precipice. The edge of the cliff. But the urge to jump isn�۪t from L�۪appel du vide. It�۪s from deeper inside than that. The void. It pushes me to the brink and tries to nudge me that last little bit. Hope held it back. Hope was my mighty defender, my protector, my savior from the void. But hope can�۪t last forever either. Nothing can! Hope is dead and I�۪m left to fight the void by myself. I did it once before. Fueling my battle with the rage of a berserker. A furious vengeance behind every strike and blow. But I�۪m not angry this time, I�۪m nothing. I�۪m cold and empty and I feel like the void has already won. I see the emptiness and I think it can be the end of my struggle. Peace. What does that even mean? It�۪s even foreign to me as an intellectual concept. It�۪s not something I have any experience with so I wonder if it�۪s even real. It sounds like it would be fun to try. To wake up without the void pulling at my brain. For my heart not to ache with every beat. 34 years now I�۪ve walked this earth and for 34 years I�۪ve felt lost among it. Always searching for my place, my home. I thought I found it several times along the way but that couldn�۪t last forever right? Nothing can! People grow and change and the sad truth is they always grow away from me. No one has ever grown towards me. Perhaps that�۪s the greatest tragedy in life. The ability to make such deeply rooted connections to others only to watch as they eventually decay into nothingness. Emptiness. There�۪s that call again, and I feel the prodding finger of the void and the callous whisper at my ear. A moonlit serenade performed just for me and offering the seduction of every promise and wish I have fullfilled. Peace. Serenity. But could it last forever? Nothing can! Perhaps if I look hard enough I can find some Hope laying around, discarded from a mind weaker than my own that gave in on this very precipice in days lost to time. Perhaps this bit of Hope can connect with me and maybe something can grow towards me and away from everyone else. We could work together as protectors and defenders of each other. Two-way saviors working hand-in-hand to battle the void back, and maybe it would last forever! Oh wait��_ Nothing Can!"
"Feeling reckless and suicidal- do I slit my wrists or overdose - neither will work properly because I'm a pathetic little shit but I don't care anymore, I'll just try again tomorrow",Why?
I'm feeling hopeless,"I don't really know how I ended up here, but I think I needed to find this. Basically, I've been depressed for a very long time. Since I was a kid, I felt sad all the time. My dad left when I was young and he's a bit of a dead beat so I never really see him and he's never been a part of my life. My mom started drinking to cope with losing him and the father of my half siblings, her husband who skipped the country and never came back. The drinking got pretty bad and increasingly worse since. I was bullied throughout primary school and some of secondary although the person who led it ended up becoming my best friend and had one of the most impressive and genuine character development I've ever seen. I got attacked by a guy when I was 14. He slapped my ass so hard that it left a bruise. pinned me down and felt me up. He tried to get us to play hide and seek, he'd taken my phone so I couldn't contact anyone and it was only recently that I realised he was trying to get me alone and I don't want to think about what for. Anyway, I refused which resulted in him bashing my head against a lamp post. Ever since then I've had horrible anxiety and my depression got a lot worse. After my first break up when I was fifteen, I started taking drugs to cope because I felt like everyone had let me down. Being so depressed caused me to lose a lot of my friends. Ecstasy was my drug of choice, but after a year I just stopped because it wasn't making me happy and that's all I really wanted. I started hurting myself too, which lasted a bit longer. I stopped going to school too, ended up leaving in my last year. I lost interest in everything I used to love. When I was a kid I used to cope by reading. It was something that took me to a different place when my mom drank herself into oblivion, and gave me an excuse not to think about putting her to bed after she'd passed out on the toilet, or on the kitchen table. I left home when I was 16, I moved in with my sister and my mom tried to take her own life because of what I did. So I moved back home, and that's where I've been since. Terrified to leave in case she hurts herself, no future in sight. I have nothing I want to do, nothing to aspire to. The idea of living the rest of my life stuck in a shitty job feeling the way I feel is overwhelming. I've been getting help on and off since I was fifteen and I've been steadily going for a year, and everything seemed like it was looking up but it's not. I have crippling self esteem issues, horrible anxiety and no will to live. I'm the closest I've ever been to taking my own life. I'm more serious about it than I've ever been. I tried to get anti depressants from my doctor today, kind of a last ditch effort to be happy but I guess she didn't believe me. So yeah, I think I'm going to take my own life. By the way, this whole subreddit's concept is really sweet, I'm happy I found it"
"I have no friends, no family and no one who cares about me; I'm living the dream because I can kill myself without hurting anyone","I tied up a rope 5 minutes ago but the realisation that I'm about to die without hurting another human was like the old feeling of excitement and anticipation I haven't felt for many, many years.I'm finally dying!!!! ������������������"
Should I tell my family?,"So I kinda tried to kill myself. Well- I wrapped a noose around my bedpost because my fan was too close to my bed. So I sat in my bedside with the noose around my neck and slowly slid down. When it tightened I felt numb. I wanted to die but I had my doubts. My vision was blurry and the numbing spread further and it was more intense. I felt sick to my stomach and my doubts hit me. I got up weakly and slowly. (Keep in my mind my feat were touching the ground I was just sliding down allowing it to strangle me) So should I tell my family? I'm afraid to. I hate myself and for the most part, always have even when I was a little kid. I'm 13 now and my brothers just make fun of me for being vegetarian and wanting to go vegan. They make fun of my beliefs and my mental illnesses (depression and anxiety). They call me gay, veggie boy, retarded, etc. my dad just tells me to man-up but they know I've always been the sensitive one. So should I tell them that I hung myself? I mostly did it because of who I am but also because of them. Sorry for the long post and thank you if you read it all. "
"Losing my mind, please make it stop","I can't believe how low I've fallen. Cannot sleep from self hatred. I just applied for a leave of absence from university and feel awful and want to throw up. Not because of bad grades but fear of wasting time and tuition money. This life is so humiliating, I can't stand it. I had to promise my family not to harm myself but I honestly wish someone killed me... I'm so sorry I never wanted things to go wrong. I don't think I'm ever going to recover.  PLEASE someone just kill me"
Drinking habits,"I noticed that my drinking pattern has changed. I noticed somewhat a half a year ago that I became more and more destructive by drinking more than I could handle.With this I became more prone to want to drink more, especially when I felt bad and depressed.2 times I remember drinking to then take my life but ended up passing out instead. I don't think others have noticed since I often drink alone which is good. Though when I drink socially people often ask if I'm ok and I respond with that I'm just tired. I try to not drink but there's a strong pull towards it because I want to numb whatever I'm feeling and thinking..."
Send me sad suicide stories,"Could be personal attempts, something you witnessed, or a story of somebody close to you and the after-effects. Anything to remind me that this isn't an appropriate solution."
17 and at the end of my rope,Hi my name is Austin I�۪m 17 and for many years I�۪ve hated my life. I�۪ve had this crazy plan since i was like 8 and by the time I hit 10 I was practicing it and going through with it. My plan was that I would write a single page every day in a journal on my computer. Nothing much just a paragraph or two a day until I was 18. Then I would Decide if life was worth living. these pages are summary�۪s of my day to day activities and In the top right Corner there would be to check marks to check one good and one bad. Well I�۪ve been doing this daily ritual since I was 10 transferring up the hard drive in my computer over and over as I upgraded and meticulously backing it up over and over. Recently over the last 10-11 months my life has token a rough turn I guess I�۪ve discovered that many of my friends have been very good at hiding how fake they are and then using my caring heart about other against me. And many other little aspects in my life have spiraled out of control. I slowly more and more find my self thinking about suicided. I find Comfort in the Notion of it strangely. Some times the thought of it really allows me to breath and feel like I�۪m in control. (Side note: I am a control freak that overthinks many things.) I�۪ve been in depression for many year and I have thought about killing my self and just ending it many times. I�۪ve even had multiple occasions where I was stuck  in my small prison cell size room with a gun to my head and just never could do it because I�۪m bound to a date. I can�۪t kill my self until my 18 birthday that�۪s when I�۪ll sit down in my room and read every single page in this journal that I have ever wrote and I will assess the ratings on all of them and mark the tally�۪s down. At that point I will decide if I want to live or not. My only fear is about this is I�۪ve had depression in my life for so long that I think if I survive this ultimatum that I assigned my self I will never ever escape depression. It�۪s always going to be there in the back of my head just Running around and around. I feel Like I�۪m never going to escape
An update from the other side of hell.,"Yes it has been numerous bouts, ups and downs, bad and worse... you know what I'm saying. Of all people, I don't have to explain it to you, odds are that you're in it right now. Well, I'm not. And no,that's not me gloating or attempting to make you feel worse. It's obviously the opposite. I was you (I still am but with this indescribable reprieve from a desire to immediately end my life) It fucking happened! I'm not promised tomorrow but today, I don't want to die-for the first time in over 20 years. As I got older, it did get a little better. There were things in these last 20 years that I'm am so grateful for and appreciative of.And no, I will not say it will get better for you. But the point is it MIGHT! Every minute of every day decisions are being made all around you that will directly effect your life. One of those decisions could be a spark that leads to that burning desire to stay alive. You can disagree with me all you want but it's just a fact. I swear to you there is a chance and a chance is hope. And hope? You know how unbelievably good some hope can feel?This is me now, talking to the me from 11 months ago, and maybe that me is you now as well.

This is the last day I'm alive AMA,Planning on opening up my wrists and arms and hopefully bleed to death.
my friend is cutting and saying he's going to be gone soon,"I usually know what to do in these situations to help somebody, But in his case. I dont know what to do. He suddenly started cutting and told me about his problems just a few weeks ago. I've known this person for like 5 years and im scared to lose him ;_;"
Death sounds pretty nice to me 25M,"Suicide or rather death is nice dream to me, I guess since I grew up going to a christian school the whole notion of ���dust to dust ashes to ashes�۝ seems like somewhat of a cathartic experience, ya know full circle type of shit.  I can�۪t say I�۪ve lived a hard or troubled life, I never went without or experienced struggle the likes that a great majority have.  I went to a good school got good grades had plenty of extracurriculars and got into a great college on scholarship which I proceeded to flunk out of because I never showed up to class.  The problem is or rather MY problem is that I�۪ve never given a shit about anything in life ever.  That last sentence isn�۪t entirely true I guess if I have to put it into words my life�۪s goal has never been to improve or change anything or anyone�۪s life, it�۪s been to be a net zero.  It was always easier to do well because no one would hassle me.  I like the easy way out even if it means a little bit of work(weird rationalization, I know).  I want to fade into nothingness.  I don�۪t want to be remembered, I don�۪t want any trace of my life to ever exist.  At this point in my life I�۪d rather be dead than to drag those around me down with my carefree wanton lifestyle because it�۪s probably depressing for others to watch my life implode by my own hand.  To those wondering about mental health shit, I�۪m not depressed, I kind of have an awesome life.  I do have schizophrenia or rather I was diagnosed with it though I haven�۪t taken medication in over 8 months as I�۪ve had no signs or inklings of it.  Schizophrenia was freaky at first and to be honest I flipped the fuck out straight 5150 status but once I understood what was going on in my head the shit was easy to rationalize, compartmentalize, and control.  Aside from some legal trouble i.e. alcohol related due to poor impulse control because yea I want to die, my life is pretty dope. Life seems like a colossal waste of time that only drudges on to make me feel even worse about the shit I�۪ve done, the people I�۪ve disappointed, and the relationships I�۪ve ruined via utter apathy.  Maybe this isn�۪t the right place to express my feelings but as much as I would love to commit suicide, it�۪s too much work for nothing.  I gain nothing by killing myself other than reliving the burden that being part of a society entails.  Call me greedy, selfish, short-sighted or whatever you want but life has no meaning to me aside from suffering.  We all will die someday unless there are cyborgs so what�۪s wrong with speeding the hands of Father Time up a bit.  I�۪m but one drop in the bucket out of over six billion, who cares, life is cruel sadistic joke, I guess the greeks had it right about Sisyphus.  I don�۪t know whether it�۪s right to continue living a tortured existence where I�۪m only bound to cause more long term hurt to those around me or in one swift action cause immediate pain that will subside over time.  I feel like a cancer to those around me.  I�۪m at an impasse somewhat wishing I was standing on an overpass except knowing my luck I�۪d land on a prius."
Why do people have so much better lives?,"It's quite unpleasant to see all these people having far better lives. I almost wish I could be like them. Main issue with me is my physical appearance. It's always been. Won't go in-depth, I've talked about the damn issue so many times before. Basically, I see myself in the mirror, I want to die. I saw myself in the mirror today, and surprise, surprise, I want to die. So I go browsing the web, I find all these good-looking people doing what good-looking people do, talking about being good-looking and how they pity the ugly, how life must be impossible for them. They're right. It's impossible. I personally really can't take it much longer. Odd thing is, I don't even feel sad or depressed or anything. I just feel really empty and alone, with that weird pressure in my throat. I know I can't do anything about my face, and I know I just got unlucky for some fucking reason (whole family is attractive), and I guess I've sort of accepted it as a fact now.But I accepted it in the wrong manner. Genuinely want to end myself just to end that feeling of emptiness and loneliness, that's all. That, and I know my life will never be as good as the life of an average or good-looking person, so I might as well quit trying.Why am I posting this? I don't know. Chances are, I'm too cowardly to actually do it. Makes life even more of a trap. Suppose I posted it to get some insight, maybe for attention, whether positive or negative, because I don't really get to talk about my problems too often in real life. Thanks for reading if you did. If you're willing to talk to me (despite it being completely pointless), I'd of course be appreciative. I know, I should hire a shrink, but I'm just a student. No money for one of them."
Hairy Trigger,"I�۪m heavily debating on taking my life, somehow, eventually. I�۪m a hideous kaiju, I�۪m in a lot of medical debt, I have no stable connections with anyone but a significant other that�۪s probably just going to be damaged by my depression and selfishness. I�۪m a horrible person. The family that loved me is dead and I caused them to suffer. Forgive the disheveled grammatically unsound mess below. I�۪m pretty drunk and it's pretty long, nut shelling the things that have led to my depressed state proved difficult. I don't expect anyone to read this, that is okay.A few bottles of fermented goodness and a resulting one night stand likely led to my creation. The ���father�۪ line on my birth certificate is blank. I have never discovered who�۪s sperm damned the broken, hideous being I am to this existence.. It wasn�۪t so bad at first. Despite my mother being many depths below financial endowment, thanks to her dependence on the welfare system, my childhood was alright up until I hit 4th grade. My mother had fallen for a low life skumbag who�۪s skill tree would involve ���deception�۪ and ���thievery�۪ during my 1st grade era. I suppose our sub-par socioeconomic level and her dwindling self-confidence greatly narrowed her options in the ���romantic partner�۪ department. He knocked her up, eventually I had a little sister. As luck with have it, he was under investigation for child molestation charges from a prior relationship. My mom was warned to keep him away from us until the investigation was over, she failed to comply on several occasions. Eventually, we were removed from our home and separated. My sister was placed with a couple, I was sent to a shabby, run-down group home. Never had I spent a night away from my mom.The separation anxiety hit me pretty hard... I cried a good portion of my time there, I was sick, and I could not eat the first week I was there which progressed what ever I was ill with. The other kids hated me and took out their frustrations by both verbally and physically assaulting me. The staff usually turned their heads and allowed it to play out until one day it got law-suitably worse.An older girl (I was eight, she was probably around thirteen) who usually initiated the torment, decided to get a few of her cohorts to pin me down one night. She approached me with a pair of safety scissors and told me she was going to cut my hair. I screamed at her, I don�۪t remember the dialogue, but she didn�۪t like it. She grabbed a plastic block from the community toy box, one of those one-humped things, and approached me. She pulled my pants off, I was screaming and thrashing but I was just too weak to do much and of course the staff didn�۪t hear me. I was completely ignorant of sexual things and my anatomy, I will spare elaboration. It hurt very badly, I told a staff member, I�۪m not sure what or if anything was done to the girl who did that to me, I was moved in with the babies/toddlers. I was fortunate to only be stuck there for about a month. My grandparents rescued me from that accursed place and had me for about half a year until I was returned to my mother. This crippled my ability to socialize with my peers. Before this incident I was very sociable.. I became a broken, awkward kid who hardly talked..My mom was under the impression she�۪d never get us back, she drowned those nagging demons with narcotics and booze. She became addicted. She sacrificed bill money, toilet paper, food, and neglected our needs to satisfy her nagging beast. All of my clothes were hand-me-downs, underwear included, from her and my uncle. I generally went with my uncle�۪s clothes due that they fit me better. My homely appearance led to a lot of harsh physical bullying through my middle school years. I�۪m quite an eye sore at my best, so, the unflattering clothes was a turd cherry on top of the shit sandwich.. We went to many ���free food�۪ events in order to have edible items in the house, and I was encouraged to beg neighbors for things.. Luckily, my grandfather lived right down the road. I invested as much time with him as I could. It was a nice escape. He was everything to me and his presence was always the most comforting. I felt a tinge guilty for leaving my sister there with a usually intoxicated mess.. Mid-highschool, my mom and I started to repair our broken relationship. She managed to get herself to take only what was prescribed to her. I was finally spending more time with her than I was else where.. She had a relapse, and I was furious. I lashed out at her, for the first time in my life I breached the mental ���no-cursing�۪ wall and called her a selfish bitch. She stumbled back to her room mumbling on about how I no longer needed her, that I could burn in hell. Later that night, I found her passed out on the couch. I shuck her in attempts to wake her up, but she was knocked out from over dosing again. I stood over her and told her how horrible of a mother she was. The next morning, I woke up to find her in the same spot, only this time she wasn�۪t breathing, she was stiff, and cold like a half-thawed pork loin. I passed out. I contributed to her loss. She was doing good up until that one relapse, I was a stupid teenager that only saw the negativeShe was the fifth person I had lost. The previous four being my Great Grandmother (old age related stuff), grandmother (suicide), uncle (drug overdose), and my great aunt (health complications). My grandfather was very close to all the above, even though I saw great pain in his face when he lost them, I had never heard him cry, then he found out my mom passed. It was the most tormented weeping I had ever heard. We hugged each other and wept for what seemed like forever.After losing my mom, I focused very hard on my scholastic endeavors and improving myself physically for the military. I did well in high school, was active in quite a few extra curricular things, art club, anything I could do for JROTC, chess club, BETA club, etc. I felt like I could do something with my life, and I wanted to make my grandfather proud. I wanted to pay him back for everything he had done for me by being successful. I tried for the military during my junior year, went through MEPS twice, and then waited. Mid senior year, finally informed I was permanently disqualified for self mutilating (which I did after I lost my mom). The discouragement to do anything with my life hit me pretty hard.. After high school, I took care of my great uncle who was battling lung cancer. He started to get better and expressed he no longer needed me. He had lived alone for decades, he enjoyed being a recluse. A few months after I moved back in with my grandfather, my uncle passed away.. Rather than go to college, I hooked up with a guy I went to high school with. The poor dude had a hellish background in the foster care system dating back to when he was very young. He had a pretty extensive collection of diagnosed psychological issues, I thought I could help him. The relationship was a mess, I tried to be lenient with his abuse, I felt his behavior was not something he could completely control. He refused to get help, honestly, we could not exactly afford it either.. He did convince me to attend college while he worked. He was a good person underneath the insanity his mind and experiences damned him to.My grandfather could not handle my teen-aged sister any more, she moved in with me and my now ex-boy friend. She had to be my priority, for now she was my responsibility. I made the unfortunate choice of allowing her homeless scum-bag dad to move in with us, this decision further amplified the shittyness of this situation.. My partner hated my sister, he constantly belittled her. Eventually, he threatened to punch her. His threats were usually genuine. Her dad called the cops on him, luckily nothing became of it. He kicked her dad out, and I knew I had to get my sister and I out of that house before something did happen. I did not want my ex-significant other to damage her anymore, and I did not want him to end up in jail. I left him. My grandfather helped me rent out a place in the slums. I trekked 4 miles to and from work, every now and again I�۪d get lucky enough to work hours that allowed me to at least catch a bus to work, or catch a ride from a co-worker. Quite a few people mistook me for a prostitute when I was going to or from work.. A couple of times I accepted rides to work because I was running late (quite literally in some cases). The first time it was a scraggly older white guy who kept insisting he was a ���good guy�۪ and wouldn�۪t do anything. He decided to snake his hand on my thigh, I told him I was uncomfortable and wanted out. After I pleaded and made up excuses, he finally stopped and let me escape his car. The second time, the vehicle that stopped held a very close resemblance to one of my Criminal Justice professor�۪s, so, I approached it. It was not my professor, but a very well dressed black grandfatherly man. He appeared trust worthy, and was driving a very nice truck, I assumed he was genuinely being nice. The first red flag popped up when he passed my place of employment. I panicked a little bit and told him he was going the wrong way. He turned around thankfully. He parked towards the back of the parking lot. He then propositioned me, talked about paying me $600 for certain things. It was hard not to buffer on such an offer. He then proceeded to touch my crotch without my consent. I froze, I never thought I�۪d react in such a way, I always thought I�۪d be a bad ass and falcon punch anyone who did such a thing to me, but, I didn�۪t. I was scared. I told him I was running late. I hated myself for being so weak, for being a prey item, for not defending myself. I did not take him up on his offer of course. He popped up at my place of employment a few times, I hid in the back whenever I saw him.My sister�۪s dad had moved in with me again, and naturally, my sister chose him over me. She stopped listening to me, constantly lied about everything, and was just very difficult to deal with. I gave up on her. I hated going back to that decrepit mill house. A few nights, I�۪d just sleep in the park near my job because I had no motivation to make the walk home. Life then got better tenfold. I graduated a tech college with my associate�۪s degree in Criminal Justice, my grandfather was very happy with my progress. I reconnected with an old co-worker who had moved down state, he�۪s now my fiance. I eventually moved in with him, snagged a job working at a detention center, and was far happier than I had ever been in my adult life. I didn�۪t much care for my job, I hated being a few hours away from my grandfather. I did talk to him every day. He was incredibly proud of my accomplishments, I had succeeded in my life goal. He talked about me all the time, to everyone apparently. And then it got bad again. My sister told me no one could get in contact with my grandfather, someone from his church had contacted her and told her he had been very sick for a while and had not showed up one day, which was very odd for him. I called him repeatedly until finally his weak voice answered. He was rushed to the hospital.My grandfather did not serve the common social construct of grandparent, he selflessly forfeited that position when I lost my mom. He became absolutely everything to me.. When I took leave from my job, I was hung up on the idea I was here to help him recover. I thought we were going to spend long needed time with each other and he was going to get better. I never once thought there was a chance he wouldn�۪t make it, even though the medical professionals told me the probability was not optimistic. He did well in rehab, however, he was put back in the hospital and ended up regressing. He wanted to come home and me being here allowed him to take that option. He wanted to leave the hospital despite it being ���against medical advice�۪, they wouldn�۪t give him anything to help with his condition if he did so.Hospice was the only option for him to go home with what he needed, and he took it. I don�۪t think he fully understood what Hospice was about, I didn�۪t either. I�۪ve dealt with Hospice before when I was taking care of my great uncle, they seemed very helpful/did everything in regards to care and my uncle did get better for awhile.. I wasn�۪t aware that it was essentially a slow euthanasia.. Immediately after I got my grandfather home, I sickeningly realized his condition was far worse than what I thought. I had to essentially carry him inside.. He could not physically do anything at all, and hospice did far less than I thought they would. Most of the care fell to me, I had no idea what I was doing, no one would help me. Hospice provided the equipment, electronic bed, a nurse�۪s aid came out every other day to bathe him, and a nurse every so often to check on his medication supply, that was the extent hospice helped.. My uncle (who had scarcely been in his life for the last decade) only visited under the guise it was ���too hard�۪ for him to see his dad in such a meek state to help out any further, while I was literally going insane watching the only person who was always there for me, my stone, crumble, and suffer because I did not know what I was doing. My sister would stay with me a day or so out of the week if I was lucky. No one would help me beyond that, I literally begged, because I knew I could not mentally handle it. I tried to convince him to get out of hospice and go back to the hospital, I did not want him to be morphined to death at Hospice, which would have been far better for him, I was selfish. He wasn�۪t a corpse yet and I was going to do all I could to bring him back. We had to talk to the social worker before pulling him out of hospice, it just so happened his preacher showed up when she was there. His mind had started to go, despite him and I agreeing on returning to the hospital, he was confused. I attempted to explain it to him again, and of course the fucking preacher chimed in with, ���You�۪re either going to die here, or die at the hospital�۪, and of course, my grandfather listened to him and said he wanted to stay at his house. I lost it, I wanted to punch the preacher in his condescending face, I redirected the rage on myself and pulled chunks of my hair out. I couldn�۪t function or breathe for a minute, I think I had a panic attack or something. My sadistic mind could not have birthed a worse nightmare. I knew I couldn�۪t handle it, but my grandfather wanted to stay in his home, so I sucked it up and refused to let him go to the Hospice facility. Luckily the neighbor came over, she sat with me till I calmed down a bit, she�۪s an incredible, selfless lady.. The next few days proved horrible. He had a very bad UTI which contributed to his mental deterioration, I kept him clean but it didn�۪t seem to help. Hospice was informed multiple times, but didn�۪t do anything about it. His mind was going fast, he hallucinated a lot, thought he was being tortured, said some very damaging things (I know he wasn�۪t in his right mind), and called my name. Continuously. He never slept, neither did I. I became snappy, I was having a very hard time holding it together, I hate myself for that. He�۪d throw stuff, knock things down, and then he�۪d be himself, just for a second, and apologize in the most melancholy way.Eventually, I just couldn�۪t do it anymore, and his mind had all but completely gone. I got him out of hospice (my uncle had power of attorney, so I had to wait for him to sign papers), and finally got him back to the hospital. By then, there was nothing they could really do for him. He was himself one last time there, and then he was gone. Just a body barely holding to life, he was so bad off they could not transport him to hospice. He suffered horribly, and I contributed to it by being selfish and willingly ignorant.My sister�۪s dad had ���disowned�۪ her a few months prior and she was living with a friend of mine, I knew she�۪d be alone here if I stayed in the lower part of the state. I decided against my better judgment, I quit my job and moved back to be here for her with my fiancee, into the place I took care of my grandfather.. She got into a dispute with my friend and moved in with me, which is what I wanted anyways. Not the dispute of course, but, I needed her. Of course, despite what I�۪ve told her she�۪s always gone, lies compulsively to me about a lot of things, and does not help with anything at all. She�۪s been this way towards me the other times she�۪s lived with me, I was naive enough to think she�۪d be different in light of the circumstances. I try to keep an open mind, I know this has hurt her too and she has been through a lot. I can�۪t help but to be bitter, towards everyone I thought would have been there for me. I know it�۪s immature, I would not have let myself feel this way before, but now I have nothing really, my give-a-damn filters are failing hard and I may just end up making this situation worse. It�۪s tormenting to realize how very much detached and worthless I am to everyone, except my significant other. I keep reaching out to people I believed were my friends, those attempts have been mostly miscarried. I need people to care about, and vice versa. My emotions and presence are too much for my partner to deal with all the time.. I fear I�۪m going to lose him for he is all I have to focus on which leads to a lot of over analyzing and assuming on my part. I am having issues finding another job in law enforcement due to my bad credit, I feel like I wasted all of that time getting a degree and a job in that field, it just didn�۪t feel right to me and now I may not be able to work in it anyways. I�۪m stuck sitting in a place full of triggering paraphernalia, all I do every night is marinade in all the bad things that has transgressed. I have no friends. I have no one, but my partner, and partners aren�۪t generally forever. He deserves better than the mess that I am and in the end, I'm going to pull the trigger, or I'm going to 'hangout' with a couple of trees. It's just a matter of when.Professional help is far too expensive and my brain enjoys tormenting me too much to truly be functional again I think. I want to be wrong, I want to believe these horrible memories and feelings will eventually stay in the little 'lost' memories file in the back of my mind. Any tips to cope? "
I feel broken I feel worthless.,"Consistent ridicule from the people I care about has always had a negative effect on me, especially recently while I've been struggling to find some will to live. I don't have my license and I'm almost 19 I feel so behind the pack so useless. My mother doesn't want me to come live with her or see me because I'm too much of a headache and a burden. I'm terrible with women and just want to feel loved; I'm so tired of being alone I'm so tired. I've given my father 3 grand in the last month so he can keep his house and have the necessities he needs. My brother kicked me out last year and still continually talks poorly about me to my mother. (He never liked me anyways Ha). The enticing feeling death seems ever clear to me I want to sleep I want someone to talk to but I can't let anyone know I am like this my family, friends, and associates all think I'm a happy fellow. Im not haha. I try doing good I care for others make sure they are taken care of.  Why do I feel this way why am I afraid to ask for help I just want to slink away somewhere quiet and dark. I don't want to be found."
I think I am going to kill myself,"28 year old male hereI don't know my father, he left when I was 7 years old. He was a negligent, disconnected alcoholic. When I was a kid my mom used to abuse me relentlessly. She would beat me with belts and extension chords, and punch me in the face and tell me I'm stupid, and burned me with cigarettes a few times.It's taken me years to pay off student loan debt for a degree that is completely useless. I live in poverty, and just hurt my knee a month ago, so now I can't even do the manual labour jobs I used to to get by.Everything just seems completely hopeless. I have no clue what I am doing, I am totally atomised, I have no family and no support. I live pay check to pay check because cause of living is so high, that even though I work 60 hours I week I am just barely scraping by. Whenever I start to get ahead something bad happens. 2 months ago I had to shell out over 1000 dollars to get my car fixed. I needed a new control arm, plus new tires, plus alignment and a tow. Now I need a new muffler, and to pass an emission test, or I cannot legally drive to work when my knee gets better.I am grinding like a mad man, but shelling out for physio therapy to get my knee fixed is costing me a ton, but if I don't do it then I'll be laid up in bed for months and then I won't be able to work, and then I won't be able to pay rent.I have 46$ in my bank account that needs to last my the rest of the month.Life is just exhausting. I work as hard as I can. But I can never pull myself out of this pit.I'm not sad or anything, just hopeless. Not depressed, just stuck.There is no escape for me. "
I'm done with life. I don't want sympathy but just someone to listen to me and to give some advice.,"Today has been my worst and lowest point in life. Is my Story worth being suicidal?i know that life can be beautiful but it's not for me. Betrayed by colleagues: just recently started at a company, my colleagues are super nice to me and I am so naive to engage in their gossip and poured my heart out enough to tell them everything. They always gossip about the boss to me telling me how psycho the boss is, how much they hate her. And I honestly didn't like the boss either but I thought we had mutual trust so I told her.
Next day things turned real bad, my boss told me everything I told my colleagues they have told her and worse, they even said I backstabbed her while she wasn't here and that my behaviour was unacceptable. If only they knew how much crap was talked about behind her back! After my colleagues and I had so much laughter and secrets shared , it was all fake and a lie. I can't trust no one no more and I'm done.
Family: told them I was upset and am jobless and they said it was my fault and that I should've just kept my mouth shut and not cause trouble. So much for thinking the only person I could talk to was my family but no they just had to throw some more rocks at my heart. Ended up breaking down and left the house, no call or nothing they don't even give a crap about me.
Money: I am jobless and struggling
Love life: I am not ugly but am a bit chubby due to being stressed and having comfort food. I've lacked self image love for my whole life and hate myself. Every date I've been on the guys won't look beyond my looks and just want skinny girls . I have told I've had a great personality but apparently men are just into hot women these days. I've been single for ages and have no luck. Maybe there's just something wrong with me.
I'm totally done with life and useless. I'm 23 and don't know what to do. As you can see my life is a mess in every aspect. Honest opinion, should I just die? "
I'm not Okay,"I guess I just need to vent, that way I don't actually end up doing anything rash
Not that I would act on it because I'm a pussy and I'm really scared of pain
I'm scared of what might be after death too, although I'm hoping it'll be nothing so I don't have to exist anymore and feel anything at all
Feelings are a joke too, all of mine are wasted daily on people that do not give an actual fuck about me
And I can't blame them, because I'm a cringey, annoying and idiotic introverted virgin
My family and I are pretty much strangers, I feel so much remorse for being absent from my siblings' lives but I've been so sick
My head has been sick for years, in good times and awful times I've always rubberbanded back to those feelings of dread, anxiety and pain
Pain that shouldn't even exist, pain from failed relationship after failed relationship, pain from being led on and then dumped like the trash I am, only to be tainted by said memories daily
Meanwhile my short term memory is clouded from smoking weed everyday just to feel normal
Abusing my friend's drugs until my head feels cloudy day by day, night by night
I feel truly alone in every aspect, and as much as I deserve to be I just want this pain to end
I want everything to stop. "
"22 and feel like a husk of a person, see no reason to go on.","I just can't do it.  I don't know how other people do it. I've had a piss easy life and I still can't fucking do it, I've been set up for success at every turn and I've failed every god damn one.  I shouldn't have been born.I don't care about anything.  I don't care about what I eat, where I live, what I do. The idea that people actively choose where to go for fun and pick what to eat is mind boggling.  There's not a waking moment I'm not a bitter fuck.  I have no passion for anything for anyone.  It's been like this since middle school.I've tried just about every legal drug for depression, to no effect.  I'm diagnosed GAD, OCD. probable aspergers.  Severe hypochondriac.  Thousands in hospital bills for nothing, just the anxiety of having illnesses and countless tests. I dropped out of community college because I'm a lazy piece of shit.  I never made any friends in highschool.  I got my first retail job a year ago, and I hate it.  I don't hate working, I hate how I can't function.  I can't process information like other people process it.  I'm always confused, and can't seem to grasp things that come naturally to everyone else.  I feel like a god damn alien in human skin.  Climate change depresses me daily, and I'm ethically opposed to my job, which is just stocking thousands of boxes of plastic shit from a chinese industrial hellhole.  Every moment driving my car and releasing fumes makes me hate myself.  But I have to survive, I guess?Oh, and also I'm a virgin, kiss-less and have never held an actual conversation with someone I'm attracted to.  I'm so god damn lonely, but I don't expect romance , in fact I'm so far removed from having an SO it's more hilarious than anything. And the real kicker? I think I have mild gender dysphoria, which I realized last year.  It doesn't matter though, I'm 6'2 and built like a fridge and would be visibly trans my entire life.   It gets worse with age anyways, so I can't see myself being alive 10 years from now either way. I don't know what happened.  People would kill to have been born in my position. I feel like I'm just prolonging my suffering for no good reason.  There are people with chronic conditions who still enjoy living in-spite of pain, and yet here I am, completely averse to life itself."
lost and willing to die,"I've had anxiety disorder since I was about 12. Recently things have become much worse. I got depressed and had many problems in my life related and caused by my mental illness. I lost my love. She was the only person who could understand me but the state I was in managed to destroy that. I also feel different from everyone around me. And this has been going on since I can remember. I feel like most people at least have someone to talk to, someone to trust. I don't. I have always struggled with some sort of loneliness, differentness and thought about death. Now I seriously consider it. I am here to ask anyone of you how to survive and to to feel understood."
Doing it next week. Either by pain-killers or jumping before a train.,My life sucks because I am low-gifted autistic with no future.
I'm so sorry. I need help. My boyfriend said I should lose weight and I know I should it's just that I'm currently battling depression and I was just starting to feel better. I loved myself. Please help.,i experience bipolar this way...highs and lows...always feeling better or worse with some stability in between.  lots of body types out there and not all are always controllable or for the reason society judges.  I think you should start to work out so that you can tap into some natural endorphins. find a workout or sport you have fun doing and it will be even more effective.
Not ready to take more damage.,"Life for me has not been easy. Yeah I realize that everyone has hardships and more bad than good but the accumulation has broke me. I'll be clear if I commit suicide  you'll never read a post asking for help from me it will just be done and over. death doesn't frightening me I just feel I'm still have a chance to give the world something positive. With that being said      I want to share a brief summary of my life so some of you might not repeat my mistakes or at least realize your actions have reactions. When I was young I had such a  fire in me for life I was happy and full of opportunity. Through things such as group beatings molestation and being general used as human toilet paper I lost my fire. By the time I was a teenager I started using drugs. It gave me an escape and ""friends"". Even though I was developing substance abuse problems I also lived weight lifting and became a national powerlifting champion and had a beautiful  girlfriend. Early in my twenties I lost my girlfriend and wrecked a car. I was put on pain killers and around the same time had started selling volume amounts of weed and cocaine. Pain killers became my everything and my business dealings allowed me a unimaginable habit. Eventually my habit over took all and I couldn't keep my professional life together. I lost my connections and my morals one by one . All my so called friends were gone along with my money but my habit persisted. Eventually what was left of me was a needle junkie living for the high and doing anything to get it. Time kept moving and the hamster wheel kept spinning. Then I had kids and decided I wanted to change. So I got into a methadone clinic and cleaned up. I did fairly well most if the time  but never really lost my desire to use. About a month and a half ago. I had a succession if bad shit happen to me in rapid order. So I decided to run back to my old friend except this time on the trip back I must have fallen asleep and head on hit a 73 year old grandmother's car killing her instantly.Now I have to deal with two massively broke legs a heart ready to burst with grief and sadness and the knowledge I'll soon be leaving my family for prison and to tell you the truth I don't know if I will go on that trip. I really hope that if some young people read this shortened simplified account of my life they may realize that what there dealing with isn't that bad and to hold on. Also I want people to realize just how life altering a decision to use drugs can be and how much of a monster opiates are.Thank you for reading and God bless"
I am just so tired...,"5 years, that's how long I have been exhibiting strange symptoms that have been diagnosed as mutriple different things, lupus, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, crohns, different auto immune deficiencies... It always changes. Every time I see a new doctor I just fall deeper and deeper into my depression and my anxiety has become so bad that I can only leAve my house if I am the one in complete control of when we go and when we leave. My poor husband is at his breaking point, he won't tell me out right  but his demeanor had changed drastically over the last few months to the point where it's difficult to look at him and not see that look that says ""you're fucking crazy"" I don't know how much longer I can deal with it all. I know it's the depression and my health issues pushing me to leave this world, it's becoming increasingly harder to quiet those voices telling me how much better off my husband and kids would be if I were gone. I don't know what else to do, I am just so unbelievably tired of all of it and how easy it would be to make it all stop. I no longer have friends which is understandable, but it also means that I have no One telling me how selfish I am for wanting to just die. All I know is I can't go much longer and am getting things in order to make things simple once it's over. 30 years is long enough for me...."
Unemployed and might have my degree revoked,I am being accused of cheating to get my degree and the college may try and take it away. I am currently unemployed and even an investigation would mean I would have to tell employers I am being investigated and I will not get a job. My relationship is suffering and soon I will run out of money and have to move home. I feel completely overwhelmed. I sometimes struggle with my state of mind in the best of times and this feels like too much to handle.
Mental health worker for 12+ years...might need some help myself,"I've worked with youth and adults for years, big part of my job was offering suicide prevention resources.  I hoped I never needed it myself but right now I might.  For tonight, no plan, no intention, I just know how these things start ... enough to know I won't log on here when I'm ready.  Just trying to make sure I do what I can, chat lines are full, not sure where else to go or do. Nothing's happening tonight so please help other folks if its more urgent"
Third attempt in a year.,"Hi SW, I'm 21 from TX/USA, 3 days ago I tried to overdose on sleeping meds and alcohol.I was heavily intoxicated when I made my attempt and had been in an argument with a friend which was a recipe for disaster.I knew the combination I took would not kill me but I intended to die from the overdose, so the intention was there but not quite the means to be successful.I don't think I have any significant adverse effects from the overdose aside from feeling tired.I cannot seek medical attention because I may lose access to my prescription for ADHD which enables me to function, I am currently out of my ADHD med which may be another negative effect on my mood.I have been on an SSRI for around 3 months and it has improved my mood.However, I've read that my anti-depressant paroxetine causes a slightly increased chance of suicidal behavior in patients under 24 which may have played a role in my attempt. I have had an increase in suicidal thoughts since starting paroxetine.I will likely talk to my doctor about the increase in suicidal thoughts and switch to another SSRI.I don't know why I wrote this, I'm not able to see therapist so I guess that's why I posted this, just to be able to vent some emotions and thoughts."
"When i graduate high school, i think ill emd myself","Im an absolute wreck. I have anxiety and depression and nobody to talk to it about. I dont have my drivers license or a job, and people keep bugging me about it. I hardly do schoolwork, and usually sleep through class. I cut myself.The anxiety keeps me from going out and looking for work, or starting to get my license. I think id die from the pressure and i dont know how ill handle it. I dont have anybody i can talk to about any of this, and i feel so lonely. I dont think any of my friends care about me, and rightfully so.When i graduate high school, and cant live with my parents anymore. And cant get up to do something. And cant bear anything anymore, i think ill just kill myself."
Almost Done,"I will end my life. I have accepted that inevitable event. I contemplated the thought for years.  I looked at my past, my present, and my future, I've considered all the variables and this decision makes the most sense. I completed all my letters, it took me a year to finish every word I want to say and every thought I want to convey.  I want to at least give them a perspective of me and what will happen to me is inevitable and my own rational choice. I researched about everything on how I will do it, the materials (i already took a picture for my funeral), the place, the risks, and what will happen after: to the people around me and to the environment. I am not afraid of death, or the pain in acquiring it. If I owned a gun now, I would have shot it already, but not until I finished giving closure and reason for my death. Because I want to die with few (if not none) questions and skeptics. I want it to be a thought-out decision because it is. I deeply thought about it, trying every reason to stay alive but there is no significant reason to tie me down in this world. Now that I am almost done with my preparations, I have the biggest relief in all of my life. I am satisfied with my twenty years of living. I have reconciled with the feelings of regret on what I couldn't do and the guilt on what will happen after. Because dead or alive, those feelings will always exist. "
So freaking tired,"There is something terribly wrong with me. I don't know what it is, but I can't seem to get anything right. Friendships, family, politics, my job... nothing seems right and it feels like I'm drowning, like I'm constantly under attack, like people are out to get me and prove how worthless I really am. When it comes to friendships, I'm the one friend everyone talks to when they need something. When it comes to relationships, guys never pay attention to me. One even said that it's because ""I'm not pretty or interesting enough"". I'm tired of feeling this way. I've gotten psychiatric help, but I feel like it's a roller coaster and I'm not sure I can handle this for the rest of my life. When somebody asks me how I'm doing, I just say ""fine"" because I feel like I'd be a burden to them if I tell them how I really feel. I'm scared about killing myself, though. I want to think that somebody would care, but I'm not sure that would be the case. I guess I just need someone to listen because I'm not really sure I want to die (yet). "
Add insult to injury,"I made a prior post (look at history) about how I broke off a long term ""friend"".I actually while sipping whiskey wrote some curt but not nasty things that she did to me. I did not curse at her or anything but i wrote down how I felt and how things are perceived by me. I told her not to contact me. I spoke to a friend of mine that noticed that I was much less happy the past month while trying to make her feel better. But he pointed out it was my choice if I wanted to reconcile or not. I did and what a mistake it was.I send her an apology text. She said it was fine. She tells me we can meet up a day later. Its a different town and I go drive there. She knew I had to do something else prior but then tells me she's not up for it but I said I really need to tell her certain things. She says fine. I tell her the things (how I battled through depression for many years) but all the time she said she really wants to go back to watching the tv show she was watching (project runway) I barely talk to her for 8 minutes (it took me 25 minutes to drive there) and I say what I needed to tell her and she says we should hang out this weekend and she will text me later. So far no text.The next day I get a call from my cousin. Her mother, my aunt died. I was not close to them because there is an age gap of 15 years as well as infighting between my parents and theirs. But I am the intermediary and go to talk to my cousins. I went Wednesday night for 7 hours talking to one cousin. And I went today talking to the other cousin. But today was emotionally draining. My uncle is telling me everything wrong with my father and what he did while I just sat there nodding occasionally while allowing him to talk about him and my father. There are times I wanted to call out his shit but his wife of 50 years just died and I can't. So I sit there for at least 4 hours of belittlement while I am pretty sure my relationship to the friend prior is over over.....I want to cry but I cannot. I am so numb though, its somewhat like when my brother died. Actually my older cousins asked for advice from me because they knew I went through it. It is very weird telling your mid 40's cousins how to prepare for a funeral that you are well antiquated with. What to do, what to buy, which casket to buy, burial plot, etc.I am just stretched so thin. I am somewhat certain that if I asked the friend to come she would but the way she is acting I do not want to bring a ""friend"" to my family's funeral. I do not think I ever want to talk to her because clearly project runway is more important that silly me needing me to tell her my problems. It seems to me that she is a taker and will not give back anything. On top of the monetary things she said she would pay me back or. Or the other things.The saving grace this week that is making me look forward, I also got a phone call from the blood donation company that I matched perfectly with a infant that needs my white blood cells. Apparently its a 1 in a million shot that we matched. I am doing it Tuesday since that is the legal timeline I can give since I donated this past Monday and am ineligible to donate for 7 days. This is literally the only light at the end of the tunnel. I need to stay alive so a kid can survive using my body that I can care less for. I am so tired. I am feeling so depressed. tired."
I won't do it.,"I'm just here. I've told all the stories many times to anyone I care about. I just have bad luck. It's nice of you to try to convince me otherwise, and you might for just a little bit, but some people just have bad luck. I'm too scared to do it. To feel the physical pain. I think about it though. I try to do stuff to disract myself but it's only ever distractions. I just want to say, somewhere, that I'm here. I'm going to bed now, I have a long day tomorrow. Thanks for reading."
Sweating after surgery,"About 5 years ago I had a surgery called Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS). This was meant to stop my palms and underarms from sweating. Before I had it I was told it was reversible because they were going to clip the nerve instead of cut it. I wasn't told about any other side effects, and I trusted the doctors.Some time after the surgery I learned that many people experience what is known as compensatory sweating (CS); the sweating might stop in one area, but now they sweat in another area. It usually happens right away, but sometimes it takes years before it starts. I also learned that ETS is irreversible, even with the clips. The damage to the nerves has been done.For 4 years I didn't experience any CS until this past year, and it has made my life absolute hell. I sweat profusely from my legs, buttocks, back, and face. I feel lied to and cheated by my doctors. I wish I could go back before the surgery, but now I will sweat all over my body for the rest of my life. I never would have done this if I knew the risks.I heard about drugs called anticholinergics which can stop the sweat, but also stop other body secretions like saliva causing dry mouth and sore throat. I tried those for a couple of weeks with some success, but I then started to experience muscle twitches all over my body. After searching I discovered muscle twitches are an unlisted side effect of anticholinergic use. It has been about 4 months and I still experience almost constant muscle twitches despite stopping the meds when it started. I've developed insomnia because I can't sleep due to the muscle twitches.At this point I feel like my life has been ruined and I am absolutely hopeless. I can't have a normal relationship with anyone because of the stigma of being sweaty. Doctor here have no answer besides different anticholinergic drugs. I am hesitant to try any of them at this point because I still twitch all over my body. On the internet I found a doctor in Taiwan that does a procedure to stop sweating specifically caused by this surgery, but if I wanted to treat all of my body it would be over $100,000. As someone unemployed who just finished college I can't even imagine paying for that, or even finding any job at this point.I've been to two psychologists, and neither of them have been very helpful. They've essentially told me I have to deal with it. Nothing they've said to help me cope has been of any use. The second one said, after explaining what happened, ""that sucks,"" which only made me more upset.I probably would have killed myself by now if it wasn't for my parents and a slight hope something might make it tolerable. I already had other body-image issues which have made me extremely depressed prior to CS starting. I've talked to my mom about my problems, and she made me promise that I'd keep trying to find something that helps. I know if I died it would kill her as well. She cares about her kids more than anything else. She already suffers from depression due to her own medical problems that cause physical pain. I love my mom too much to hurt her, but it's so difficult to keep going when nobody else understands. I wish I never had this surgery done.If anyone actually took the time to read all of this, thank you I appreciate it. I had hoped writing down my experience and how I felt would make me feel better, but I don't know if it really has."
Enough,Please life just stop it already. I'm so sick of being shit on. I can't keep this up. I can't keep up anymore. It's taking everything in my power to not walk out the door and do it. I have a plan and I'm not afraid of it. So long as he doesn't have to wake up and find my body. I can't learn on him. It's not fair to him.I can't take things at my own pace. People  just get mad when I try and say my needs. My needs aren't worth it. I'm not worth it. One last cuddle. He heads out tomorrow or during the weekend. I could do it then. I'll figure it out.I have so much emotion. And I can't do anything about it. Trying to fix things only makes it worse. I can't keep up. One sleep...tomorrow i can get it over with.Why am I even posting this...I don't even know. Maybe just so some record of this outburst exists. Maybe so I feel like something I say matters tonight. Something I feel matters at all.I know it's not fair. He's still grieving. I'm such a selfish ass for this. And for that I'm sorry. I'm just too weak. I need to bed...this is too much
An interesting situation,"I would not consider myself to be a person at risk of suicide. I recently had my life go downhill quite a bit and had quite a few stesses effecting me, including some anxiety issues (though I think it's mild and I don't really experience panic attacks - more just catastrophic thinking amongst other things).I think I'd be too cowardly to actually commit suicide, but when I was feeling really down I thought hard. What reasons do I ACTUALLY have to keep living? Suicide would surely make my life easier.Dunno, I genuinely cannot answer this question to myself which surprised me at the time."
Songs on repeat.,I got the song on repeat. I'm just sitting here dark room music playing I'm ready. I tried telling my step mom I wanted to die. She laughed it off. I don't judge her her step son would never kill himself. I dont qant to blame anyone I think im just sick. I never looked for help that was my downfall.I'm ready now. Grandma is coming over in 2 hours I don't want her to see anything. I'm sorry. I love you all. I hope you see this. Please don't trace me with this. If I don't go through with it I don't want anybody to know I had everything planned. I want things to get better but that requires time I don't have that I guess.
I'm on antidepressants and amphetamines and living with my grandparents because no one trusts me to be alone.,"I am trying to make a life that is worth living and I can't, I just want to not desire death all the time and I do, and nothing I do can change any of that.I pursue hobbies, I try and find people I enjoy and spend time with them, I play games, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take my meds, I read, I meditate. I try and do all of the ""healthy behaviours"" and hope that eventually some of it will make my life okay and it doesn't. It just doesn't.I'm a fat, hideous, worthless, boring person who no one has ever or could ever enjoy. Every friend I've had has hurt me or hated me and I just wish I could know why so I could fix myself, and they never tell me. I try not to be overbearing, I don't tell people about my depression. I'm open and honest about how I spend my life and my values.But isolation is hell, and I have no one. And I don't think there's anything that can be done to live a life where suicide isn't the most palatable option.Please help me, I don't know what to do."
"Please help, I don't want to feel like this anymore","I feel like my friends aren't even friends with me anymore, feels like they don't care about me at all, I haven't talk to them for a few days and none of them are worried about me, unlike if any other person in our friend group did that they would freak out a little. I feel like I've only ever had one real friend and I rarely talk to him. I have thoughts about just killing myself daily, I'm scared that I might do it? I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore, I've stopped doing homework, I don't really like anything anymore, I just want school to be done with so I can just actually fucking sleep, thats the only thing I like anymore, is sleep. I really wish I didn't exist. Please help I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm just tired of life, doesn't help my mum thinks that this is normal and since she has depression she thinks that since she can deal with it I can too."
"What should I write on the room's door, so that they do what they should?",I'm going to commit suicide using helium. What's the best way to write something so staffs calls the cops instead of entering the room? I don't want anyone to be traumatized.Not here to contemplate.
I have been feeling sad.,I have been feeling sad lately am 13 years old school really stress me out I have trouble coping with exceptions for my classes am going into grade 9 and am really not feeling it. I just could hang myself I mean what's the point.. it's not like gonna be missed I have barely any friends and everyone hates me.
Is it considered suicide?,"I have a friend who is really depressed. She has a genetic disease that is basically a ticking time bomb. She just wants to let the disease the course because she doesn't have the heart to do it herself. I've been trying to talk her into going back to the doctor and trying to manage her disease but she won't listen. I want to help her. She has three kids, and she's basically setting herself up to die sooner. "
"Alone, Depressed, No Control","Everything in my life is awful and I just want the pain of existing to stop. No matter what everyone thinks I'm stupid, no one cares about me, every one is too busy to put up with me. So I want to end it all so I can stop bothering everyone.Nothing helps, I'm poor I can't afford help, I'm not religious and don't believe any of it basically, I'm sick of people telling me ""it gets better"" because it totally doesn't. I've tried getting friends or girls to like me but they all give up on me because I'm an uninteresting piece of shit. I want to die so bad. There's no place for me in this world. I'm afraid of suicide, but I almost hate living more. Nothing good has happened to me within months."
I need things to be better now,"I've been suffering for ten years. My life is absolute shit, no matter what I do. I'm broken down by it. I can't try any more. I need a miracle, for some good thing to happen to me. But it never does. "
its starting to get bad again.,Been a few months and im starting to feel that way again. I don't wanna go back to the hospital but damn this is hard.
I'm lonely. Also basically just a rant about my fucked up life.,"It's my senior year of high school. My boyfriend of a year and I just broke up. My best friend since the second grade hardly hangs out with me anymore. I feel like an outsider in all my classes. Nobody gets me.I kinda just wish I would die. I know this all sounds super petty and like a ""typical teen,"" but it's really how I feel... the only reason I'm staying here is because of my baby niece and my parents. I love them. But that doesn't mean I don't consider running my car off the road on the way to school some days.My recent ex said that I don't have depression, anxiety, ADHD, or Asperger's, despite the fact that I was diagnosed with every single one and have struggled with them my ENTIRE life. He says I'm making excuses for my problems. He told me I need to grow up. What I wanna know is why the FUCK he thinks he knows me better than doctors or even I know myself? Who are you to say that it's all fake? Have you fucking tied a noose and put it around your neck just to see if you had the guts to actually do it? Have you been in my head when I'm going through an episode? Because it's fucking hell, and you have no right to judge. I thought I finally found someone I could trust who wouldn't judge me. I was wrong. How the FUCK could he see the scars on my legs and say it's all just in my head? How the FUCK could he see me break down in tears out of nowhere and say it's all just a lie? Do you know fucking everything? I think not. So how fucking dare you mock my pain in such a way. I'm so goddamn angry.I hate both love and life itself right now. I don't want to be alive. I'd be okay if I fell asleep right now and never woke up. Life is just a meaningless struggle that I have been forced into. My heart is filled with pain and frustration. I must stay to be here for my precious little niece, my very reason for being, but fuck it's hard sometimes."
they're back.,"anxiety & depression, they are back and worse than before, though it feels as if they are the only ones with me.its getting bad, i've stopped eating & have been quiet. my thoughts are racing, i can't handle this anymore. "
Suicide over her ??,I loved my ex gf so much. We dated for 3 years and I lost sight of everything in the last year. I became controlling possessive and isolating. I realize what I did wrong and have been trying to change for the better. But she won't give me the time of day. I am no contact mode with her to focus on myself but for fuck sakes it's so hard. She meant the world to me and I have tried to commit suicide twice over this. The first time I hallucinated the swat team was in my appartment and the second my parents rescued me as I laid half past dead on my couch. Both attempts were over dosing. I also survived a pretty bad car crash too so with in the last month and half i have survived two suicide attempts and a car crash and I still want to end it. I just love her so damn much and want to show her how much I changed and that I am the man that she fell in love with. I have also been cutting too and self harming. Can anyone help me ? I just want her back so badly!!!!
three sleeping pills should do the job,"goodnight everyone, sadly i will be waking up in eight hours."
Hm..,"I just don't understand why my body is constantly suicidal...it just seems to be a default at this point. Like even if I feel content, once the distractions fade and I relax, I am suddenly ready to die."
Goodnight,"It's a goodnight for me, forever. Bye world. Let these bits of information saved as text be the last of my marks left on Earth. Bye."
I'm just done and I can't take this anymore.,"I'm just going to write exactly what I'm feeling and whatever I want to writeI've honestly never felt so hopeless and lost in my life. I've never hit this low of a point. Last night I was using my phone before bed and my touchscreen stopped working and no matter what I tried to do nothing made it seem to work. I remember just losing it last night and I started sobbing. This sounds really mild but it was just like one thing that suddenly was thrown at me on top of all the other things I was feeling like shit for.I'm at this point in my life where I seem to have nothing going for me. I fucked up so bad in community college last semester and the years before that because I've always been so depressed I can't even get out of bed. I got into a car accident two years ago when I was and had a permit and I've been way too shaken about it and haven't driven since then so I don't even have a license, and because I don't have a license I don't have a job. All I do everyday is sit in my room and then go to sleep. I never go outside or talk to anyone in person outside my family. The only people I do talk to are people I know online from internet communities. They're my entire social life. I come from a very traditional Christian Orthodox family from the middle east, and I am bisexual, so all my life I always hated myself for being that way, and I would try to cut myself whenever I had any thoughts (back in middle school and early high school) and I never talked about it with anyone until I started meeting other gay on that online community I know on discord. This one person in particular started talking to me about it and made me feel not shit about myself for being that way. I then realized I had feelings for her and in January of this year I told her that I did and she said that they had feelings for me too. We decided we'd try a long distance relationship and for the first time in so many years I finally felt really happy and didn't hate myself. I was in love for the first time. A week into the relationship she told me she was having gender identity issues (I knew her as a male at the time) and while it threw me back a bit I told her that I still love her and it didn't make a difference to me.I then tried to improve myself, by doing better in school, trying to get a drivers license, and looking for a job. In March of this year I decided that I wanted to go see her in person. And we got really excited and I managed to book a flight in May of this year from LA (where I live) to Cleveland (where she lives). I of course didn't tell my parents the exact reason of why I was going because I'm not sure if they'd let me go. When I got to the airport and saw her for the first time I was so happy and excited. She drove me to the hotel I had booked online, and when we got there they didn't let me check in because apparently in Ohio you have to be 21 to check into hotels and I had only just turned 20 and she was only 19. I felt like everything went to shit and she started crying and I felt like complete shit. But eventually we realized that none of us thought about using Airbnb and we managed to actually find an entire house for ourselves to stay in for less the price of the hotel. Being there with her was the happiest I had ever been. Sleeping in the same bed as someone, getting physically intimate, and all that sort of thing was just something I had never experienced before and didn't know I needed. I just felt safe and happy as weird as that sounds. Then after almost a week came time for me to go back home, and I think that's where things started going downhill fast for me. She drove me to the airport and we kissed and hugged for like five minutes and then I got out and watched her drive away. I went inside and checked in and when I got past security and got to the boarding place it hit me like nothing had ever hit me before. I started crying in front of like a bunch of people and I had to run in the bathroom. I never felt more alone in my entire life. Thankfully I managed to calm myself down enough to be able to board the plane and the flight was at night so I was asleep for the whole flight back. When I got back home I was supposed to go to class that day about two hours after I got back home but I was just so exhausted physically and emotionally that I decided that I'd just go the next day. For the next two weeks I cried every night and stayed in my room not talking to anyone in my family or just anyone besides her. I couldn't go to sleep because lying in bed alone made me feel extremely lonely and spurred all kinds of emotions in me. Eventually once I was able to go to sleep my semester in college that year was already over and since I was too depressed to go to any of my classes I ended up failing all of them and since I was already on academic probation I was put on leave and I couldn't attend during the fall semester. So since then I've just been a fucking mess. Everyday I wake up feeling a wave of anxiety hit me over my situation with school, not having a job, and most of all my relationship (which I'm still in).I've felt so helpless, lonely, anxious, depressed, hopeless, and whatever else term there is, since seeing my girlfriend in May this year. And through that loneliness, I've become way more clingy than I ever was and I hate it. She's the only thing on my mind, and I start panicking over everything. I panicked when she wouldn't reply to me for more than five minutes, I would get jealous when she talks to other people in that online community, I would get worried when she hangs out with friends at her uni because I would get paranoid about her cheating on me, and most of all I panic over the very thought of her breaking up with me. It's all entirely irrational too, and I hate it. I fucking hate feeling this way. It's honestly made me feel way more lonely than I ever was because I'm not getting the amount of attention that I desperately want. I haven't really talked to her about any of this either, nor have I told her about my situation with school because I don't want her to realize how pathetic and clingy I really am.Sometimes when I'm lying down in bed trying to go to sleep, or I'm outside doing something I get random reminders in my head about the time I was with her and I'd get really emotional and try not to cry. I hate going to sleep because I see her in my dreams and I wake up crying. I decided that I'd try to visit her again at her uni in November but it would cost me about $600 in total to get there, which I don't have right now and don't think I could get by then without a job. And even that sent me on a panic because I get scared that she might get bored of me if I don't visit soon or that if I don't visit her then, then I wouldn't be able to visit her for a long time because she'd be busy with finals after that and then would go back home and spend time with her family. Last night I was using my phone before bed and I was feeling more ok than usual and suddenly the touchscreen on my phone stopped working and idk I just lost it right after. I was crying and couldn't stop. I woke up this morning and was hoping I'd feel better or be able to fix and neither of those two things happened and now I have to get a new phone which I don't have the money. This sounds weird but I just feel so done with everything. I'm done with myself mostly. I'm done with my pathetic existence and the fact that I get so spurred by emotions and anxiety so easily and so intensely that it literally stops me from being a functional person. I'm just so done with waking up another day and dealing with myself and my feelings. I don't even care about improving myself anymore. I was already improving myself earlier this year but then I ended up being far worse off than I ever was before. I'm just incapable and I always will be. The one good thing that ever came to me has in a way ruined me and destroyed me, because I couldn't handle it. No amount of therapy can or has ever helped me (I've been through therapy and taken anti-depressants constantly all throughout high school and it did nothing for me)I just don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to go to sleep, I don't want to feel happy or sad. I just want to cease existing. I never realized how suicidal I actually am until now. All I've been thinking about is dying and putting myself out of this. I don't know if I'd actually end up doing it, but thinking about killing myself has been the one thing I've felt somewhat hopeful about for a long time.Sorry if I sound unreasonable or whiney, I just thought it'd help to write this all out, but honestly it kinda hasn't. I just feel the same and I hate that through writing this out I had to acknowledge some things about myself that I didn't before. "
I gonna try and end it again,"It's a long story. I'll start from the beginning.When we started dating it happened really fast. The second date she had me stay over at her place, and we were making out and naked, things were getting hot i went to make a move i was hard. She said no it's too soon and we don't have a label on the relation ship. I didn't mind being blue balled but she said no . Few dates later we put a label. A couple weeks later she goes to visit family for a month. Before she goes we go to have sex. That's when it didn't work my dick didn't get hard..... I was devistated, she did nothing to try and help arouse me basicly said what ever. Later then night i went to try and do stuff with her again she said no pushing me away i felt extremely rejected. I felt sooo defective.... Like i was broken. Anyway she gets back from her trip and doesn't want to do anything with me cause she's on her period. Augest was a bad month for me. A lot of stuff was causing me serious stress. I suffer from depression which only made things worse. One night she rejected my efforts yet again. I felt the world falling beneath me. It wasnt just her rejection, it was my families financial problems, my 2 best friends moving away, her constant rejection and me feeling like the pathetic 22 year old virgin that i am. I attempted suicide....... She didn't know. But on her birthday she found out. I was with her and she asked me about it i denied it then she just walked up and left. A day later she broke up with me saying an old flame msged her and she wants to try with him. A week later we go to talk and she wants to be more then friend but not a couple... I heart broken say yes.... Worst yes of my life. She starts telling me about guys she's seeing and i can't bring my self to say stop. She's only been with 2 other guys. This one guy devon she said she was in love with him. Still. Ps he is the only one that's fucked her good. he only uses her for sex and she tells me about how she doesn't want to be one of the other girls that says they love him because that happens to devon a lot. He need loves them back but hey she's in love with him. I find out she fucked him during the time we were dating before we had a label............ And shortly after we broke up.......... I'm fuming now.... She keeps telling me about how much she likes me, and gets cuddle with me and uses me as emotional support..... So we talk and agree to have sec again... I want to do it to try and redeem my self. Worse night of my life... I'm pretty much suicidal right now...... Btw remember how she didn't want to have sex in the beginning because we didn't have a label on the relationship........... God i am a fucking moron I'm not hung up on her spacificly but rather my pathetic love life...... "
Just an empty rant,"It's been five months and on the outside I look like I finally have it together. I'm not homeless anymore, I volunteer, I go to disabled people groups for people like me with chronic pain and mobility issues, I'm getting a therapy animal, I work on two different therapy tactics to gain control over my various disorders. Yet I truly died early January, I broke over and over, I went into psychotic episodes, I lost reality, I lost my home after a pretty bad chain reaction break up (SO cheating, finding out I was pregnant, a miscarriage, having to leave the property we had,him taking all the furniture)a person I'm still in love with and a healthy body combined with a lot of mind games, lies and constant pressure from other people that just kept pushing me over the edge. I'm just a difficult worthless and unlovable person. I developed pneumonia twice, various viral infections, A womb that's damaged and my chronic pain got worse. I had many trips to the hospital during my five months homelessness, I got briefly stalked and attacked by a man in a night shelter I was staying at, I began ignoring my pain level and forcing myself out everyday, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I refused my medications, I was constantly anxious and having panic attacks daily. I got addicted to sleeping pills for a while, if anything just not to remember and just not have to face reality. I got my home two months ago, I saved every penny I had during my homeless time and bought new furniture, decorated, a disability bed etc and have disability functions installed within so I don't get so tired. Yet for the life of me. I still wake up everyday, empty, cold, wishing I was dead, wishing I did die, I stopped speaking, my friends and siblings only wanted a house to use, money to borrow, a hotel with free wifi. Forever showing up uninvited, triggering ptsd and anxiety with constant knocking multiple times a day despite my protests of not wanting anyone near me or telling them I'm out or not answering the door, they didn't care. No one cared or checked in if I went off the radar for weeks unless I could do them favours. I run but nothing stops it. Nothing eases the memories or the pain, or the ache you feel when someone you loved isn't there anymore. How you miss them so badly your teeth ache, your chest hurts, your head replays all the best and the worst parts in your head. Knowing you're not good enough for the world, for friendships, for life, for family that only check in to borrow money, knowing it was all your fault, you're the toxic, ugly, evil person and no amount of remorse or guilt you feel can fix it. I forced myself to change and be healthy but I'm just an empty shell, a damaged doll with an expiry date. I tried to do good with false hope it'd eventually get better but nothing changes how it feels, nothing is going to make people care or my dad to love me, or for people to come back, to notice and miss me if I disappear.I'm already a ghost, I just wish I had the courage to finally end it."
I am quitting once i fail to meet the training standards this is enough.,"As i move closer to finishing my requirements for work, i am having second thoughts. I was just forced by my parents to work.
Threatened and made sure that i do it by having me watched. They told everyone that finally i have a job because it was with my own decision. But never told that to make me move, they had me threatened. I am already willing to go back to school.
But was given excuses Like there is no more money. Imagine the shock i got when i found out they bought gold and watches.
And trying to fix what they had ruined. I have been fooled. "
I'm so done. Please help me,"I am 20, I can't tell much about my personal life however, all I would say is that I have this particular issue that my family and some people mock me for. They don't understand it. It has been causing me a lot of depression for long. I am now also in a relationship but my family wouldn't approve of it.. It may get to the point that they would literally create lots of arguments for me.. My sibling also had certain issue and moved far away to Europe to get away from my family because they were causing her hell! She tried explaining them but they wouldn't listen and would just laugh at her to the point she decided to sort of.. screw them and make her own choices... Since I am young, I don't have to take any step for my relationship just yet but later on I may need to and just the thought about that stresses me. My family thinks they are doing right in their own way and are trying to protect us.. While I was away to Canada for university, I got disconnected from them to the point that I was willing to stand up for myself for what I believe in and also, I sort of started hating them for dividing the family so much. However, whenever I go back home to France, my family show me so much love that I end up feeling guilty for everything I feel, think, believe etc. For summer vacation, I stayed with my family for 3 months back home and I got so connected that I feel soo depressed. They seriously do a lot for me... Its just that they think what they are doing is right and no amount of argument or discussion is going to change their mind.. Believe me, I tried. I was pretty much a ... family oriented person back when I was in high school.. My siblings were my bestfriends as I was bullied a lot in high school. I have also been sexually assaulted. I loved hanging with my family more than anyone else. Now its so hard. My depression has increased to the point that I ended up getting bad grades, have headaches all the time, lost interest in my partner, feel tired all the time, just thinking about future makes me cry and the only way I feel a little relaxed is when I think "" Ah perhaps I will die soon"".. Also, I am having lots of problems with my university.. Professers are shit, degree is risky cos people who graduated from here, some of them claimed that many faced problems cos of their degree... as the university isn't accredited by the Canadian law.. Rather the country the university is originally from... I talked to my family about it but they don't think anything would happen and just keep telling me "" Don't listen to others "" .. I am so fed up of explaining them literally anything that I am just done. I don't wanna do it now. I am so stressed about literally everything.. Career, family, future etc. I don't know what the hell to do.. I just wanna kill myself. The only thing holding me back from committing suicide is the thought of hell existing and me not knowing whether God is pleased with me or not."
Cutting doesnt feel good anymore,"I used to cut all the way down to the white meat, and i loved the pain. i loved how it felt. But it left really bad scars. Im constantly thinking about slitting my wrists, with just a little more pressure all of this could be over. yet I cut lighter than i want. and it doesnt feel the same anymore. I still feel like shit afterwards. no many how many times i cut. Maybe if i cut deeper the happiness might come back."
Please I want to commit suicide I'm scared,I don't want to live anymore I hate this world
I feel like I don't quite exist,"I have been feeling like ending it for quite some time. I hope that this place allows me to vent. I'm not sure how well I will be able to articulate my thoughts.
(I am a freshman)
I feel like most of the time I'm not quite here. Nobody seems to notice I'm here unless I say something first, or during a lull in the conversation I say something. I am not greeted unless I greet them first. I will say something multiple times and no one will notice. No one seems to care about me, yet they seem to notice everyone else. A lot of my ""friends"" are just seem to be friends because we happen to go to the same school a few days a week. I don't have any other extracurricular activities, except for Boy Scouts, but everyone there is just dick to me. All the boys in my grade don't click with me, except maybe one. The only people I trusted moved away, and one of them for I all know is dead because of the hurricanes. There is maybe one person I can trust.What makes this worse of all is how I feel so useless. If I were to die today, other than my immediate family, no one would care. People might be sad in the sense that ""Oh how sad. Somebody I knew in some way died."" Yep, I am sort of smart in some ways. Yes I have 1 friend who might be sad. I haven't added anything positive in anyone's life. The 3 things I love: math, politics, and debate, no one wants to talk about, and religious or any type of debate in school (Even if the teacher allows it, or even participates,) is discouraged. ( I am an agnostic in a Christian school, which doesn't help either) I seem only to be detriment on people's lives. I'm ugly, no girl wants to be near me, the one that I like just thinks I'm strange. I can be jerk, which I try to change, usually. I can be to smart for my own good. I make jokes that no one understand, and then I just feel even more disconnected. It's like it's being dangled in front of me, ""Here are these people who are nice, who you could be friends with, yet they don't notice you, don't care about you, and don't give to flying craps what happens to you.""
I am a feel so sad all the time, like I don't want to do anything.
Most of the time, I just wish it would end, or something would just change, and I just disappear. But I also have the feeling of ""Can I have a 30 day trial for Death?""
As I read through this, it seems petty. Yet there is more, but it is hard to describe. I cannot articulate how I feel well."
Just my thoughts,"So I'm writing this here because I just need a place to share my thoughts where I know people wont put me down or yell at me or be toxic in anyway. I have thought about suicide a lot in my life. Planned out ways and even had a serious attempt that I survive from. Oddly I did not recieve help for this attempt.... mom just kept me away from school until I stopped throwing up from the multiple bottles of anti depressants I had taken. it was never spoken of again and I got this feeling that it was very very taboo to ever mention it to anyone. So much so it was 6 years before I told someone who was amazed I wasn't rushed to the hospital for this. Guess mom thought since I was throwing it up I would be fine. Skip ten years after this event and I still have a hard time taking pills like my body just wants to reject them. I didn't have another attempt after this because of a promise I made to a friend (then sexual online RP partner who also faced depression and suicidal thoughts) said friend failed to keep their promise which honestly should have made it ok in my mind to go back to harming myself but this person was so important to me that I still hold up my end. Kind of sucks and still hurts that they continue to cut and burn themselves but I am no possition to help them out other than emotially and even there they are getting more and more distant from me...I pray that they are ok.But skip to current days and the more recent thoughts on this matter. I am now married, with a wonderful spouse and things should be happy for me. In all accounts from someone looking at my life they would say. WOW you got it lucky....lucky? I'm an american living in central america due to spouse getting a military job here so we can finally pay off depts. I dont speak spanish, I cant get out on my own because I cant drive (poor eyes). We live in a gated community here which should speak of safety but my paranoia is so high and my fear of other people is so great I cant even bring myself to sit on our walled in porch and enjoy the sunshine. Spouse got me a kitten to have as a house companion but I keep having thoughts of wanting to kill it for some unknown reason to me and then I cry when bites or does something that annoys me because all I can think about it is killing  it in some way or another. now I have never been violent to animals in my life. or to people. But violent thoughts are becoming more common in my brain. I fear the day I will do something that I cannot take back. Maybe it stems from the constant pain and the near daily dislocations I suffer with EDS. I'm terrified of stairs because I never know when my muscles and nerves will just stop working and I will fall. Fell two weeks ago....still recovering from that one. I will not appologise for how long this is. If you care, if you want to help, or just be an ear for me to rant in then you wont mind at all how much I type. I'm sick and tired of saying sorry for everything I do if someone around me seems even the tinyest bit upset at or around me. My childhood PTSD has gone untreated for years and was only diagnosed a couple months before moving here. I cannot get my meds, I can get the one for my EDS pain management but anything like antidepressents, or anti psycotics I need to see a Dr for...which not speaking spanish is a BIG issue on that front. I could go into a rant about my childhood abuse, about my dad's abuse in the past and my mom's abuse even today. But I dont think anyone wants to hear about that...I tried to post about it in another subreddit here for those raised by bad parents but...no comments, no views....I think it actually got deleted for some unknown reason. all I was doing was asking for help for me and my brother who is suffering worse than I am....but WTF ever right?I used to take alot of comfort in writing....I wrote all the time in grade school but somewhere, I think half way through college (which I never finished) I got a really bad case of imposter syndrome. Where I felt like I was living someone elses life....someone whose mother praised everything they did all the time, never getting a bad or constructive comment...someone who in college finally got people saying that there work needed work....so 18 so years of people constaintly praising her seemed all like a lie....""they just said it because your slightly austic"" ""they only said it was good because your depressed and they didnt' want to make you hurt yourself."" ""They only said it because your the sterotype fat goth writer"" ""your work wasnt' really good, they didn't want to make you sad."" now ever time I pick up a pencil or open a doc those thoughts run through my head...over and over and over until I finally put down the pencil or delete the doc. Was told once it was a type of OCD, a thought based one caused by my imposter syndrome and my depression, and my near schizo paranoia of the world. If I try to write about my own life and abuse well the thoughts dont come up as loud...but if I go into the fantasy line of things they assult me as if they are real voices in my head. They are not though just my own thoughts. I cant do anything creative because of these thoughts.... Painting minis? nope even though I had professional painters my work was amazing for a beginner. Writing? Nope even though when I do share my plot ideas people are sure I ripped it from some movie summery that its written so good. YT videos? suprisingly the thoughts are much quieter when i am recording a let's play but still there. How about improving myself by trying to learn spanish or one of the many fields of science I really enjoy? Nope....the thoughts are there to barrate me and put me down until I finally stop and give up on trying to better myself  in anyway....HELL even trying to read a new book or watch a movie I've never seen the thoughts are there telling me to back to what is safe.... I've watched law and order SVU so much I have most of the episodes memorized...same with NCIS, Foamy the Squirll, and the book IT (which if about 44 hours long, takes me a couple months to listen to it all. and once i finish I start back at chapter one again)....so yeah....this is a bit of a rant...bit of a cry for help....and just to be clear getting thearpy here is NOT an option for one I am not a local and two I dont speak perfect fulent spanish. (and yes I did try to get a job teaching english...they never responded in anyway, not even a  sorry you're not what we are looking for.)"
"Friend is struggling, I'm lost on what to do..","A fellow redditor recommended I post here, so hey everybody. Hope you're all doing okay.One of my closest friends has been struggling with severe depression and his bipolar (not sure the exact diagnosis) since his only sibling passed away last year. Unfortunately we both dabble with recreational drugs, and lately he's been using heroin and other opiates very heavily, and i believe he intentionally overdosed on Tuesday. He's alive, I'm picking him up from the hospital tonight. Luckily I was there when he injected himself with a massive dose of heroin and called 911, tried to keep him conscious till EP got there and revived him with 3 or 4 doses of Narcan. Watched my best friend slip away, circle the drain, turn blue and then slowly came back... it was rough. I can't imagine what he's feeling or going through.I talked to him this morning, he seemed apathetic that he was still alive as if I made a mistake calling for help. I told him if he wants to get off the dope I'll help him get started at a suboxone doc. I know the withdrawals cold turkey would just exacerbate his state of mind.But that doesn't address the core of what's going on... I just hope I can help him get back to where he was 2 months ago. He had a decent job, seemed to be stable and actually happy for the first time in a long, long time. I know its really up to him and it's his choice, but I'm doing whatever i can to help my friend. Any support/advice/anything is appreciated."
The worst part about SI..,"Military guy here. Long story short, it isn't for me. It's driven me to have frequent suicidal ideation. I've lost a career because if it, but for now I'm still stuck in the military system. I wouldn't classify myself as at risk; I simply won't do that to my wife. As bad as things are for me, I can't imagine giving her that grief. So the worst part of SI, no one believes me. Often I feel I want to do it just so people would have taken all the help I've requested seriously. Instead, I'm called a malingerer. I'm labeled as one trying to con the system. I'm treated as a criminal for not having the will to deal with job stress anymore. I've given up fighting for what I believe in and getting what I want, aside for a discharge. I feel like I'm downing. I feel imprisoned. I haven't been seeing any help for the last six months since the only outcome is more restrictions on the limited freedom I have. As soon as you mention suicide, you're targeted for ""help."" Not one of my superiors has wanted to help; they just want to cover their assess in the event something happens. So yeah. I'm not in a great place. If anyone wants to chat a bit (military preferred), shoot me a PM. I could use a stranger to vent to. I feel bad telling my wife (who is suffering from depression), and I don't want my few friends to see me like this. Hell, I don't want the world to see me like this, but like I said, I refuse to return to military mental health providers."
Death date,"Well, I think I've decided that there is no hope for me, and my life isn't going to get any better soon. Ever since I was a kid, I've always felt that I wouldn't live to be over 30. Well, I've decided that the only way for me to be happy is to do everything I wanna do (travel, meet friends, create art, etc.) and then kill myself at around 20.
To be honest, I'm just bored of life. Thinking of growing old and working the same monotonous job and being depressed all the time just sounds like hell to me. I don't want to live a long life, I wanna do what I wanna do, and get it over with. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Well, I've got less than 2 years left. The date might change, but so far, I'm deciding on 20. "
I'm just gonna starve myself,I haven't eaten all day. And I don't even care. I'm just gonna lock myself in my room and hide from the world.
My family hates me,"The title speaks for itself.
My sister hit me multiple for actually being happy today, apparently I was too loud when I was laughing.
My parents, they always call me names- idiot, stupid, bitch...Edit: My mother just said, ""go back to your room you lazy fuck, you'll just be a dumb bitch to everyone else"" all because I said a box was to heavy. :"""
I know I'm going to die alone,"I'm a 16 year old guy, and I know I'm going to die alone. Sometimes I feel so lonely, and that no girl will ever love me. I know I'm way too ugly. I have a big nose, a big forehead, a lazy eye, lips that are a bit too big for a guy, acne scars, and red hair. I know there have never been any girls who have had a ""love at first sight"" feeling when they saw me. I want to fix everything, but it costs too much. I am too ugly to live."
Struggling in college.,"I just started my freshman year of college and I feel like a fish out of water. I have been struggling to make friends and everyone else seems happy and competent. Most of my life I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and a serious learning disorder called nonverbal learning disorder (it does not mean that I am mute.) The classes are going at a much faster pace than I am used too and I am worried I am going to get kicked out of the program I worked so hard to get into. There have been many days in the past two weeks where all I wanted to do was sleep. I've been suicidal in the past and am going in that direction again. Help meUpdate: I am feeling better now after so many people reached out to me. I am going to meet with my advisor so she can guide me, as well as my contact in the disability services office to see if any of my accommodations can be adjusted. Thank you everyone for all the kind words and advice. It really warms my heart to know that people actually care even though they have never met me in person."
Is the System broke...or doing exactly what it was intended for?,"I have epilepsy. Have since I was 17. I was on disability for a while, but when I moved to NV I was on medical marijuana. It helped. I was improving. Went two years without a single seizure. My migraines were under control. So, I thought...I'm young, I can rejoin the workforce. I was always an anomaly among my friends. I love to work. I love the satisfaction of bringing home a paycheck and paying bills. Before everything went to shit, I'd had two jobs since I was 15. Not because I had to, but because I liked it.Fast forward back to NV. I'm 23. I haven't had a steady job in years and I'm finally starting to see improvement. So, when my part-time side job lands me an interview in Ohio with a big-name company? Fuck yeah. I jump on it. But it all goes wrong.As soon as I leave NV, the migraines come back. I work for a year and a half. I make good money. Like...good money. Yay, money. But when the seizures start, that money works against me. I try to take ""lesser"" jobs. I consult, I end up back in retail. Anything to stay in the workforce. But when you have seizures, you miss deadlines. You're late. You're out for weeks at a time. I can't function when I'm present. I can't remember things I promised to get done. I get fired. I get hospitalized. I'm out of work.By 26, I knew I couldn't do it. I couldn't manage a ""normal"" life. I tried. Goddess, I TRIED. I tried until I was curled up in a ball in my bathtub with the lights out, begging for the pain to stop. Because I knew the moment I went to my doctors and said I needed the medication, I would be out. They've tried so many different drug combinations and they never work. Surgery scares me, but fuck, maybe I should just let them hack out parts of my brain.I reapply for disability. We wait. And wait. The System says that I worked for ___ amount of time, so why can't I now? The System says that I was too ""skilled"" a laborer, so I should be able to do ""unskilled"" work. The System says I'm too young to be disabled. I appeal. I reappeal. In the meantime, I try to work and fail. I appeal again. With no income and living with my boyfriend, it's too much. We move back to NC where everything is cheaper and my family lives. Thing is...in NC, I don't have insurance. I can't even get the medications that turn me into a zombie but keep my brain from becoming a country-fried mess. I start having seizures again. At home because ER visits are expensive.I try to go to school, thinking, maybe I'll find a career that will work with the disease. I can't make it through my classes. I'm stuck. My depression--something that...if you knew me, you'd think was impossible--is a silent monster, eager to lap up the agony of my 2-week-long migraines and the hopelessness in my heart.I can't keep doing this. It's exhausting. I'm so tired. I just want to rest. Without pain. Without the burdens I bring to the people around me. I'm . I'm hyper-aware that I'm home alone right now. I need help but I don't know how to get it.So I'm here. Hello, Reddit."
Sitting at work,"actually sick and tired of life. Been thinking about driving my car off the road multiple times in a week lately. I sleep all day everyday and then work. That's it. That's all I can muster up the energy to do. Life isn't fun anymore. The only thing I truly love is my cat, and that sounds fucking sad but he's the only thing I look forward to when I come home in the morning. I'm inadequate and will never amount to anything other than a mass of fat sitting in a chair rotting away. I've been walking around staring not at the floor but a little bit above that just enough so that I don't walk into a person that matters. I don't know what to do anymore and how long will it take before these thoughts turn into actions? Sometimes I wish I could catch a sickness from one of the patients at my job (I work at a hospital) and just die from it. I'm sick of this tightness in my chest. I'm sick of the fact that only xanax makes my brain calm enough for me to feel okay. I'm sick of feeling so lonely and weirding everyone out. I can't apologize to everyone I've hurt in the past and even if I did they'd never believe me. Why don't people like me? Why won't anyone love me? I keep deleting things and rewriting them because my dads voice telling me to ""stop with this bullshit woe is me,"" is pinging around my head. I'm watching both of my grandmas die simultaneously from two different problems and they have one thing in common. They've lost all faith and feel like less of a person. Why would I want to get old? I'm already in enough pain as it is. I really don't want this anymore. If I could get a return on my existence, I would."
Down,"I came back from holiday so refreshed. I missed home and had an ambition to do well here. And I've been cut down so many times by the smallest of things. I need help, but every time I seek irl help I'm met with rejection. I am done with it. I'm overtired. To top it off I have an infection in my leg that is killing me. I can't walk more than ten metres and I have to pretend to the world I don't have it. I've tried to seek out medical help. No one available. I know exactly what meds I need and I can't get them.I don't feel like I should bother with anything anymore. I just want to curl up in a corner and die. I hope this leg infection kills me, but I highly doubt it. I just don't want to deal with anything. I don't want to talk to people. I have a couple commitments in the next three weeks, then I'll cut off communication with everyone. I'll quit my responsibilities, cut ties with my family. I want people to stop caring about me. I just want to be left alone."
I tried to die and I want to try again.,"I took the whole bottle of sleeping pills almost and was like not sure if it would kill me just was going for a whatever happens happens. But afterwards I was just disappointed. Last time I felt relieved when I was ok. This time I feel like I failed, didn't try hard enough, I only feel angry and I keep thinking it supposed to be dead right now and now I just want to die more."
How do I talk to them about this,"I'm not sure if i just have moodswings or something but im very suicidal right now, I want to tell my roommates but I'm worried it's kind of a ""boy who cried wolf"" situation because they've seen me like this before and maybe they won't take it seriously? I have no insurance ... barely enough money to survive. It's all my fault. Idk how to take out a loan im already in 80k medical debt anyway. I'm a 19 yr old teenage idiot with no family. My roommates are my only friends, really"
I can't shake the feelings and thoughts that I am truly alone.,"I've been struggling a lot lately and while I can say that I do have friends, I can't shake the feelings that I am really, truly alone. This journey that I'm undertaking to become my best self is a really lonely one. I'm pretty shy and reserved so it's harder for me to get out there and talk to people.I also am estranged from my family (no plans to reconcile, as the situation is very complicated) and recently broke up with someone I deeply care about, due to my own insecurities and lack of faith in the relationship. I have no idea if he'll take me back because I honestly want to be with him, but I feel like I'm too messed up and toxic for anyone to want to be with.I run away constantly from good things in my life because I'm too scared of the future 'what ifs' of how things can fall apart.I don't know what to do and can feel myself spiraling down. I really want to end all this pain and suffering that keeps coming back and am one bad decision away from doing so."
I don�۪t know how to get out of this hole,I work the night shift at a warehouse and my parents tell me i should quit because I come home really exhausted after 10 hours a night. I tell them I do it for the money but really It�۪s the only thing that keeps me from thinking of self harm and suicide all the time. I hate that it so much.
Nothing matters.,"I used to love everything I did. I got nothing but As in school and put my best effort into everything. Even though my parents were divorced and I didn't have that many friends, I was doing just fine.Now that I'm in the 8th grade, everything has changed. I don't have the purpose to do well in school, but every failed test and quiz is like a knife to the heart. My father will disown me if he sees my grades or if I associate myself with African-American people, even though I think he's insane for saying so. I'm the worst fucking daughter and I hate myself for disappointing my parents. Why me? Why was it me that got to live? Why not someone with purpose, talents, beauty, smarts, and hope? My mom is right, I am a worthless piece of shit.I was walking to school this morning. As I crossed the road, I suddenly had the striking desire to lay on the road until a car came to bless me with the sweet release I have been longing for. What is the point? No one cares about me anyway. I moved to this area 2 years ago and no one would bat an eye if I killed myself. People who moved just a month ago already are so popular and have so many friends. Why? Because they're beautiful and smart, unlike me. No one wants to associate with an emotional brat like me who started self-harming and even her therapist says it's just out of stress, she'll get over it.Constantly, I wish to die. I don't know if God loves me anymore, though. And if I didn't believe in God, my whole family would despise me. I've tried calling the suicide hotline, but they never answer. It's quite ridiculous, really. Maybe it's a sign that I should just go through with it already. It'd be a relief to my family."
I think I'm close to my end.,"Hello all. I think I'm going to die soon. I'm not sure how, I've researched a ton of different ways, and have yet to settle on what seems the most accessible. I was fired from my job a month ago today. I loved my job. I understand why I was fired, though I also hate myself for it. I'm getting evicted from my apartment because I can't afford rent due to not having a job (not that I haven't been trying. I've gone to about ten interviews and have applied to over 100 places.) I'm losing everything. I found a new home for my dog. She's my world. My family will not let me stay with them (my mom claims there's no room in her townhome, the rest of my small family doesn't like that I'm trans.) I feel like a burden. None of my friends have space for me. The thing that makes me want to die the most though, is my sister. She committed suicide almost a year ago. She was my best friend in the world, and I miss her every day. Sometimes I wonder if I'm suffering from PTSD with how poorly I've taken to everything. Songs she used to listen to, shows she used to watch, hell even phrases she used to say a lot trigger a major anxiety episode.And lately it's like it's never ending. I just want to die. I can't think of reasons to live. I'm going to be homeless, trans, unemployed, and with nothing to my name. Why do I matter."
Broken Soul,"Slowly gaining peace of mind with killing myself.
Years of depression and recent suicidal thoughts and always kept going hoping things would getting better. And they did to a certain point. Suicide has always stuck in the back of my mind.
Taking 2 steps in the right direction and getting slammed 3 steps back. I'm 22 now,when is this going to get better?
My mother and father are both dying and probably have a year each(in and out of hospital).
I have some friends but they wouldnt really care if i passed.
Always worked my ass off at whatever job i could find and tried to become a cop since i was 18 but always got rejected in the first round. so i applied to the army since a couple days.I'm just broken, and i can continue being this way but its fucked up. Sorry for the random vent, thanks for reading."
"For the first time in my life, I'm actually considering suicide",I don't even know what to do anymore. I love the people I know but I seriously don't even know if it's worth it anymore. I'm seriously considering getting heroin just so I can feel good.
This weight is crushing me,"I'm sitting here at my job, bored out of my mind. It's a decent job, although the hours (1a-9:30a) are a problem. I've been getting terrible sleep recently, and that's probably the cause of at least some of my problems. Typically I go home and sleep until the kids get home, then wake up until they go to bed. My wife doesn't go to bed until I've left for work, so I sleep alone sun-thurs. I've got three kids, and I feel like a terrible father. My 7 year old daughter wanted me to play barbies with her last night, and I didn't. I Just didn't want to. It almost made her cry and all I felt was exasperation. My wife and I were having problems last year. She started meds to help her anxiety that killed her sex drive, but after months of trying to keep our sex life alive I stopped. It was just too exhausting. She stopped taking her meds without telling me, and her sex drive came back, but I'd already checked out. So she had at least three online affairs. I eventually found out, and doing the math she was having affairs for 10-12 months of our 14 year marriage. I was a complete wreck for almost a month. I took her phone randomly to check up on her, I scoured our past phone bills for evidence of her texting or calling and noted all the contacts I did see. I eventually decided it hurt too much to distrust her and realized I was actually happier in the brief time I'd given up on our relationship and focused on my own happiness before I found out about her affairs. I realized I wasn't and couldn't give her the validation she needed. We talked, and decided for her to post in one or more of the gonewild subs. I had full access to her account, and could see all of her communication. I even tested her by making up a username and pming to see what she did. Despite having a name that suggested someone local that she could probably meet up with, she panicked at the thought someone out there might find out who she was and never even PMed back. At first I was doing all of the posting, as she said she wanted me involved. She wanted it to be for us. But she did message some guys back and had conversations. One in particular was getting a little too personal for my comfort, so I asked her to stop. Amazingly, she did. Then she started posting on her own. Sometimes she posted references to her husband or being married, but not always. Yesterday she had me take a pic of her flashing while making dinner, and in response to a comment asking what wasd for dinner she mentioned that she was for dessert, hubby's favorite. I woke up alone in bed at 11:45, and just laid there until 12:10. I got out of bed and went upstairs to find her reading on the couch. We had a cigarette together on the porch and then I went to work. I was making coffee when I saw another post from her. New pictures, mentioning being ready for bed, and included some of her touching herself. I over reacted,  and we had a text argument until almost three am about how it looked like she was fishing for guys again. I deleted the account I'd been using to post pictures of myself and commenting on her posts as her husband. I basically told her I was going back to sticking my head in the sand and letting her do what she wants to be happy. But I don't want to. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of being so nauseated at the thought of my wife with someone else that I can't eat. I'm tired of being a terrible husband. I'm tired of being a terrible father. I'd planned to commit suicide nearly 3 years ago, on my birthday. I went to work, and had my gun with me.  I planned to get that last bit of overtime and then drive into the mountains and shoot myself in the brain like my grandfather did. On my first break I checked my voicemail and had one from my girls wishing me a happy birthday. I couldn't do it. I snuck the gun back into the house that night and haven't really thought about it since. My birthday is coming up. 18 days. I'll be 38 years old, with depression that's been untreated for over 20 years. I'm just so tired. At this point my wife can take a flying fuck through a rolling donut, but I can't do that to my kids. My oldest is 14 and already showing signs of depression. I have to keep fighting, to prove to her that it's a winnable fight. But I fear I'm losing more and more each day. TLDR: a bunch of rambling poor me bullshit. "
I really want to self-harm again. Losing all hope. 17/f,"Recently I just got this gut punch of depression where I don't feel like anything is worth it. This is the worst I've felt in a while. I've been doing good but I just really want to cut again. I keep cutting deeper each time but it's such a release from all the pressure of grades, and getting ready for college. Sometimes I just see myself committing suicide before my late 20's. I just don't see myself making it that far in life."
I don't want to live anymore I don't I don't.,Please if there is a god or anyone out there at all listening please I just don't want to live anymore take me away from here please I can't anymore I just can't. Please.
can someone just convince me not to commit suicide,"i tried to yesterday. chickened out, almost made it all the way before i stopped.
but, next time i know it'll be different.
i'm horribly depressed. i have been for many years. since july it's gotten out of control. to the point where i plan out my suicide daily. write my suicide notes daily as well.
everyone has left me. all my friends, including my best friend of five years. without any warning. just stopped talking to me. my boyfriend left me. said it was all my fault and that he didn't care about me and that i was nothing to him.
i started college now and it's just gotten worse. i'm in debt, i can make no friends there, and these days i don't even go to class. then i hear the disappointment from everyone around me.
i sit in bed all day. i do nothing. i've lost 30lbs give or take, i don't sleep (currently haven't slept in over 24 hours), and i don't even take joy in the things i once loved.
on monday, i was at therapy when my therapist laughed at me while i was telling my feelings. the same day someone was threatening me with blackmail and said he'll ruin my life if i don't let him rape me. and when i tried to reach out to multiple people they all gave some response on the lines of ""i don't care.""
i guess this is my last attempt. my last cry for help. "
Can't believe I am here again,Quick recap. Stopped self harming in December. Had a failed suicide attempt in January and in March started separation process with my now ex husband. It was tough going but my suicidal urges went down and I thought gone for good.But nope. Life keeps kicking me down. I got to the point last night that I had to call my therapist. I just looked at the overwhelming mess in my house and life and wanted to kill myself. Now I just want to take a bunch of pills and sleep for a week.
"I feel like I'm in the sidelines of life, and want to die on my own terms","I've been thinking for a while, watching my life slowly become worse at time goes on. Experiences after experiences lost, activities that seem normal to some just aren't me. I feel like I am living on the side lines of life and I can see the rest of my life too. I'm going to continue paying off debt and working tell im in my 60s. If I can retire, I can't even enjoy my retirement because racking health problems will prevent me from doing that. That is, if I make it to 60. I have a heart condition that has a high chance of preventing me from living past 45. I will indulge in meaningless shit, trying to feel human but can't. I will always be a husk.
I don't want to feel happiness, I don't want to do anything besides die and end this stupid act once and for all. I can feel my mental capacity and motivation dwindling. I wish I could be like the lot of you, I wish I could be normal. I wish reality felt real.  So, one day, maybe a year from now, maybe sooner, I plan to shoot myself, and that will be that. "
I've committed to planning my suicide.,Does anyone want to keep me company?This will take a while to plan and execute.
Slowly Dying,I have been depressed for sometime now. I used to go to a counselor every other week but then summer hit and I had an internship that made it really hard to make appointments. But a lot has happened since I have seen him and I feel like I am back to the start. Were I just want to die. The most ironic thing is that I always wanted to die in an accident or get a serious illness. Well about two months ago I started having liver problems and I found out a few weeks ago that I have an autoimmune disease that will eventually kill me. They say it will take probably 40 years for it to actually kill me since it is not a super serious disease. The funny thing is that I got what I wanted but I do not feel any better.
I'm starting to doubt that it gets better...,"I'm 22. My life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew. I can't remember most of my childhood because I was raped my a priest when I was in fourth grade. I can't really remember much of anything about my life. Even shit that happened fairly recently. I can't maintain normal relationships. First one ended in me being stalked for five years. Second one was just me being used. Third/fourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth (no, it hasn't come back a year and a half later), and seriously contemplating death. This is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety. And then  I got kicked out on short notice.Fifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together. After two months of not talking I started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing. I kind of hate myself for it, but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because it's really hard for me to meet and approach new people. My only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority. These people also think I'm a fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me. I don't really blame them.I got bullied a lot k-12. I understand why. I'm generally strange and aggravating to be around. I've worked on it a lot, so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours. After high school I took a gap year in Germany. That was a mistake. I was pretty lonely and just drank a lot. And then I started blacking out (turns out PTSD from being raped as a child can cause that), and my family basically told me I was on my own and that they didn't want to deal with me coming back at the moment (at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought I was having seizures).College sucked. I chose poorly and wasn't ready. I did a year. I'm still on leave. I know I'll never be able to afford to go back. I'm not sure that I want to. Up until Thursday I didn't think I would have to. Because this summer, after all of the bullshit, the shit jobs, the loneliness, and everything else, I managed to actually get the job I really wanted. And then I went and somehow found a way to fuck it up. Actually no, that's a lie. I know exactly how I fucked it up. By being myself.I'm not sure what's left at this point. My entire life has been about making it to the next place because that won't suck, right? Only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard I try. I don't have dreams for the future anymore. When people ask me where I seem myself in ten years I'm completely lost because I can't imagine even being alive in ten years. It's not that I plan on being dead, it's that I don't see how I'm going to make it. I'm just tired. I want to stop. I've been pushing for what feels like my entire life now, and I just want a break. My earliest memories are of someone stomping on my fingers on the playground while I'm trying to draw something on a piece of paper. I don't want this anymore."
Goodnight everyone,"I don't know honestly, I'm trying my best and I've tried my best, but I've been felling empty for so long. I don't know what's happened to me, but I can't go on like this. gosh I don't mean to sound so dramatic. I'm lost not because i don't know what to do, but because despite doing everything I could nothing has changed. "
"I am just waiting out my inevitable end, but I feel that I should vent and make myself feel better.","I'm not a very motivated person but my ambitions are great in proportion and I feel that any goal I put in front of myself whether it's cleaning my room passing my college class (not with an A just passing) but everything I do that I don't set a goal for myself I do rather well and I feel like it's some sort of shitty curse I gave to myself to forward my misery because God knows that no one else made me really unmotivated and lazy. I've set goals up for myself and I've seen myself fail multiple times and it just hurts to see that happen, and on top of that I'm a very large dude and I've only gotten larger since I was done with football in high school and throughout my high school career no women would talk to me unless they actually wanted something from me like what were the answers for homework or using me as an into some football ""star"" and any advances I've made on people just crash and fail in a Hindenberg of emotions and I usually just push everything down until I don't have to deal with it anymore which for most issues works most of the time. I've also been in an accident where I killed a man walking home from dinner fault was on both sides I ran a red light because it was an angle to the light and I saw the green arrow for a left turn and as the angle came up i neglected to see the red light and drove past and hit him, and on his side he was drunk, high as a kite, and literally half blind, but none the less it was an incredible burden to put on a 17-year-old kid who already  feels pretty shitty about life, oh also the prelude to all my emotional problems probably have root in the fact that my father was a raging alcoholic which to my siblings (3 all younger than me) were thankfully spared from because there was quite a bit of space in years which meant that I was the most fit to make the drinks for my father and stay up past the other kids which put me in prime positions for his beatings until my mom (who thankfully was never hurt) decided that she had enough and took us away and finished her education and we're pretty well off considering the fact. On another note (nice transition I know) last year around this time I told my mother that I didn't want I've been having suicidal thoughts and it was only getting worse and worse. I didn't tell my mother this but basically the only thing that was stopping me from killing myself was 1 my I didn't want my family to find my body that's a really shitting thing to do to the people that you care about, along with the fact that my absence from the world permanently would really fuck up the entire family as I have close relationships with the majority of them at least them to me, not so much me to them anymore I've slowly pushed most people away in annoyance to everything because people get really hard to tolerate sometimes, also the other thing that prevented me from committing suicide was that I didn't have anything that I thought would end my life peacefully I had I shotgun and I love shooting it it's a rather Zhen thing just to shoot targets, but that got taken away from me for obvious reasons after telling my mother which is difficult to explain that I wouldn't kill myself that way because I don't want to kill myself that way lol. Carrying on after I told my mom I agreed to be admitted to the hospital so I could get my noggin serviced unfortunately it was a rather full hospital that our insurance would cover so I had to sit in the Psych ER for a couple of days and that was just miserable I had to sit next to some legitimate loons in my passing who just got thrown in because the cops didn't want to deal with them, and a lot and I mean A LOT of girls who had a bad breakup essentially just being processed in and out as fast as they can, the only person I could tolerate (yes I know that all these people are suffering in their own way but I'm not much of a people person to begin with so put me in with the rough patch of strawberries and it probably won't end up working out for my psyche) was this recovering drug addict who got thrown in for being a loon in the bar part of town who was just struggling to get by in life and you could see the legitimate damage life could do to a man through his eyes. I eventually got sick of waiting and really uncomfortable with having the cattle get brought in, fed their pills and processed out so I decided to leave and leave I did and I didn't really have any serious issues because I was just glad to be out of there and didn't really think too much about it until now; I'm starting to have this feeling of worthlessness and self-pity and severe laziness creep back up in me and it's a really shitty feeling and to be honest I probably would have killed myself if I wasn't so set in living in my moms attic with a high-powered PC and a vast catalog of games movies and tv shows to keep my mind chewing on something besides my shitty life which I'm probably just too unmotivated to do anything about until it's too late and I just get fed up with living a boring mundane and worthless life.
P.S
I also want to add that my best friend just left for boot camp a couple months ago and I mean he was like my serious best friend we got together like peanut butter and jelly, but he got out of high school a year after me and enlisted because he thought it'd be a good plan to get his life started, and now that I'm starting to hear from him he's having talks about getting married and starting a family and moving on with his life within the next handful of years or so and that's something I'm not willing to move to yet and if he moves on from life, our ultimate self-interests will just drive us apart in life until we maybe talk every now and then and losing my only nonmaterial release is just disheartening to me and I'm lost because I now really have no friends and I'm not the socialising type or really one to try to maintain friendships it's just too much effort for me.
TL;DR
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place of being not being motivated enough to fix my life and not being in a shitty enough condition to kill myself, and I'm just waiting out which part is going to break first the laziness or the will to live. "
Draft of my Suicide Letter?,"To (you, my love)I'm sorry about the things I've said to you. My past doesn't justify what I've done. It doesn't. It never has. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. And in all honesty, I think you're beautiful. Everything about you is beautiful, don't let anyone take that from you. Even me. I don't deserve you. I never did. I think you deserve so much better - go out there and find it. I need to join my dad now. I feel like he needs me. I think he's lonely. So don't worry about me - I'm with him. He'll take care of me. I want you to know that I love you, not just as a friend but as a lover and the only family I've ever truly known. I do. But not all family is healthy. I have to go. Please don't hold yourself back. You are so amazing, I can't even begin to describe it. So keep at it."
My girlfriend,My girlfriend has recently started cutting heavily onto her thighs at night and it's been get worse over the days. How do I get her to stop? She gets offended easily so everytime I bring it up it just goes to shit. I just want to know what her perspective is right now and why she is doing it. I don't know where else to go to.
I know what is after life and I want it,"I had an NDE in 2009 after an ATV accident and I remember the afterlife. It was so beautiful. No pain, complete and utter peace(for lack of a better term)My  Life is similar to a vacation where you�۪re staying at an acquaintance�۪s house and they tell you ���make yourself at home.�۝
But you�۪re still a bit uneasy, and you still tip toe around because you know you can�۪t get too comfortable, and no matter how many accommodations they can provide, you know that
It. Is. Not. Your. Home.
It never will be. I will be going back home this Friday the 22nd. I already have a place, time,and plan. Thank you all for your encouraging words and support. "
Why not?,"Just simply, Why not?"
It's my birthday,"And I have no life or friends to celebrate with. Actually, I would just accept not being so suicidal and depressed all the time as a gift."
