What now...?,"so, im 17, and im in my last year of high school. as things go, ive been always credited on my academia, apparently im pretty clever but this hasn't ever been something i've cared about. so i had to apply to uni and shit, and everyone's excited for me, but i'm not. why? because im not going to make it to next year when the time comes. im sitting in all my lessons fucking doing nothing because all i can think about is ""should i do it today? how am i going to do it? why has my life come to this?""  ive been to doctors, counsellors, the school, all umpteen times and everyone just sends me back to each other, bouncing me from pillar to post. everyone knows i want to kill myself but nobody really.. acknowledges it.
as though even if i did it, it would just be.. inevitable.  and nobody would give a shit. which is true. and i'm fucking sick. it's been like 3 years of suicidal thoughts but over time they've become disgustingly close to becoming reality and im fucking scared. i just want to die yknow. maybe i will.",A3,1.0,"The text indicates active suicidal ideation, a history of persistent suicidal thoughts, a lack of support from professionals, and a sense of hopelessness.

School isn't hard, but life is, and life is affecting my school work.
I wanna do great and finish college, but that seems to be a fleeting dream.
I'm running low on cash, I wont' ask my parents because they already had to cover for me, and I feel guilty enough asking them for money.
Jobs not calling me back, even though I got the job, and I'm supposedly in the system.
No girl who understands me, or who I can talk to.
I don't wanna worry my friends because I'm sure they won't understand

A draft of my suicide note.,"Someone please talk to me before I do it.""I�۪m really sorry it had to end this way. The truth is that I�۪ve always felt out of place in this world. Places of comfort are hard for me to come by and certain human emotions remain inaccessible to me. I feel, and have always felt, so alone here.In a room full of people, even those who I love dearly, my reality seems to be from the vantage point of an outside observer, as if I�۪m in the midst of a movie but as an invisible spectator. I watch life happen from the outside in, never actually living it. It�۪s hard for me to relate to others but do a good job at looking like I do. It�۪s even harder to find people who can relate to me but do a good job at acting like they do.I have no real identity. I belong to no labels and no label can claim me. Many who have met me have told me this: ���You�۪re different�۝. While contemporary culture places value on uniqueness and self-branding, my being unique and different has given me a lifetime of uncertainty as to who I am, where I am going, and what I want. I�۪ve experimented with these questions time and again over the years. I�۪ve failed every single time. The result of all my inquiry is nothing. I am nothing but a passing breeze in everyone�۪s hair. I have no impact. I do nothing. I want nothing. I am nothing.Whatever I have been through, however trivial or substantial they may be to different people, is inconsequential to the stupidity of this existential crisis that I can�۪t seem to escape. Don�۪t feel bad about this, don�۪t question what you could have done to save my life. Scoff at my weakness, my lack of self-discipline, and how I took myself too seriously. I�۪m aware of all of these traits and I know they�۪ve made me hard to be around, hard to love. I, too, have struggled to be around myself, and have spent most of my life escaping my own self.The one thing I can say with certainty is that I love my family more than anything. They know me more than anyone else could and accept the real me more than anyone else ever has or ever could. Mom, Dad, Ash, Ate, Kuya ��� you are all angels in your own right. I�۪m very, very lucky to have been born into this family. I�۪ve done very little in my life to express my endless gratitude for all of you. Please continue to hug the kids for Auntie Lex, and teach them to be strong in the face of life�۪s bullshit ���  a lesson I cannot teach myself, but only embody in my own fate. I love all of you more than you can imagine.I wish I could go on living. But life was meant for the living, and I�۪ve been dying inside for a long time. Life, lived properly, lived as you all have lived it, looks so sweet. I�۪ve never felt worthy of that experience. I may not be the judge of this, but then again, who is? There is no real answer to that. So I may as well judge it for myself.I�۪m so sorry you have to deal with this. I don�۪t want you to deal with this anymore.Love you forever,

I came across this subreddit when I searched for suicide help/Hotlines etc I contacted 3 of them and WOW what I waste that is all saying the WRONG things and very generic , DO NOT say to a suicidal person anything about family from what would they think  or think about them ...

It's not that I want to die... More like I just don't want to be alive anymore.,"Not a day goes by where I just wish I was dead.So here's the story...About three months ago, my fianc̩ was killed in a car crash while on a road trip with her dad. She died 2000 miles away from me, and the sonofabitch who killed her is still alive. My life has fallen to absolute hell ever since.She was everything to me. Every single thing I did, I did for her. We'd been together for 15 years. We had plans. We were going to buy a house, finally get married in Hawaii, and start our family. All within the next year or so. She just got her Nursing Degree. High School sweethearts. She's the only woman I've ever been with and happily so. Then some stupid fuck in an over-sized pickup truck plowed its way through her car and three others and took her from me.It should have been me. I'm the one with poor health. I'm the one with a darkness inside him that only she could quell. I'm the one who, if not for her, would probably been in prison by now. She was Good. Capital ""G"". Not an unkind bone in her body. She was a nurse, for fucks sake. She dedicated her life to helping others. I'm sitting here, a next-best-thing-to-sociopathic alcoholic with anger issues who she chose to love. And I'm alive and she's not. What the fuck kinda' universe do we live in where that's the outcome?Now my existence has no purpose. I have no direction. No meaning to my life. The love of my life was taken from me at 29. There's nothing left for me here. She was literally my whole world.So now I'm living with my parents again. Both of them joining my grandpa on the path of senility and/or dementia, not sure which. My dad is slowly losing his once sharp-as-a-tack mind, and my mom is getting more and more loopy by the day. They're all I have. I was never one to have many friends, and my family is tiny, relative to most. Soon I'll have no one.There is literally one person in this world whose presence makes things at least okay for a little while, and she's the busiest person I know. I'm lucky if I get to see her once in three weeks. She's my oldest friend, and she cares for me, but she simply doesn't have time for me. Things are... close to okay, when she's around, but that's... very rare.So here I sit. Her (my late fianc̩'s) family telling me ""You'll always be family to us"" and shit like that, but life goes on for everyone else. I'm stuck in this hell and everyone else gets to just keep living their lives.Think I'll wait until the wrongful death lawsuit is over, then find the guy and kill him. Slowly. Then, either take my own life, or death by cop or inmate. Haven't really figured out the details yet.So yeah. Pretty down. Not seeing a lot of reason to  end it. No light at the end of this tunnel.

A friend of mine wanted to kill himself at a party,"Last saturday at a party, a friend (we'll call her Lilly) told me that Alex (one of her best friends, who was in the party that night) wanted to kill himself, probably that same night. In my experience, I know that if you wanna kill yourself you dont really tell anyone unless you want some help from them, so I had my doubts but I was of course worried.  Ok so, by knowing this, now im in a complicated situation, I went to the kitchen to think a bit and Alex appeared, he said like 2 words and then I inmediately started talking about life and trying to be really motivational, he didn't say a word after that, I worried a little more.
About an hour later Lilly comes to me and says ""What the fuck did you tell him?"", Alex had been drinking A LOT and I told him to go outside and have a talk ""guy to guy"". I revealed that Lilly told me his intentions and that I couldnt ignore the fact, we talked like half an hour about his problem, we both cried, Alex told me that he didn't find any inspiration or meaning to his life, he felt like a failure, trying to live up to his parents expectations but ending up feeling useless. He didn't talk about this with almost anyone, he felt really bad about wanting to do it but not wanting any help.
I told him, mainly, that life is extense and full of oportunities of any kind, that he hadnt wasted his life, he's still young, he has a lot of time to get back on track and find meaning. He gave me a big hug and thanked me, but I don't know if he took my message seriously.
We go back inside, a few moments pass and he just keeps on drinking, he seems nervous, I try to make him chill, Lilly appears and Alex kicks her in the leg, I look at him and ask ""Why did you do that?"", he just looks at me and falls to the floor, passed out, we grab him and put him in the couch so he can rest.
I go to the bathroom and while i'm inside I hear Alex yelling at Lilly ""you fuckin bitch! you just think about yourself!"", Alex gets kicked out of the house.
A few minutes pass and Lilly recieves a call from Alex and puts it on speaker mode, we didn't understand him, he sounded very drunk, we both hear a weird sound, like the phone falling to the ground, we inmediately go out and search for him.
I was very scared in the way but we find him a few houses away, lying on the street crying. Their parents arrive at the scene, Lilly called them after Alex was kicked out. I only told their parents ""talk to him"". They took him back home and I hope he's doing well. This whole thing happened between 11pm to 3am (aprox).I'm not looking for advice really, I think he is the only one who can change his mind, but i've never been in a case like this. I, myself, had struggle with suicide in the past but I found inspiration in the unexpected.

Why can't i just turn life off,"Everyday when i'm trying to sleep i hope to not wake up, it would be perfect.
I just can't understand so many things that it drives me crazy. I have a great family i love them, i am smarter than most, i'm healthy (at least my body is), but i can't do anything. I stared 2 colleges but could not finish either one, i'm 24 but in all my life I worked for 4 months.
Live today is just waiting for death to come, i'm doing treatment and taking my medicine for 2 years already and still think the same way, I'm not in a hurry to die, but I know that I'm on a cliff, the only thing holding me is the love for my family, I don't want to taint them with a son who killed himself I don't want my mom to suffer, but that's it and to live a life where the only thing I need to do is go to therapy twice a week I may be enough, but to live a life where I have to suffer everyday fighting against my own head to do things that's absolute natural to others is not even close to being enough.
It's scary to say that to someone that knows me or knew me, they always feel that my problems is not problems at all, that everything I'm going through is normal for everybody and even me thinks that way sometimes.
I can't understand how and why some people have the energy to wake up everyday and go to work at something they don't like. I know the answer most of times, they need the money to survive, but what would make me leave my house? Survival is not important to me.
I never had plans, never in my whole life I earned money and thought ""oh, now I can do that shit that I really wanted to do"". What happened was that I months after earning that I searched for a way to use it that would not be a waste.
The last time that I had sex was 8 years ago, the last time I kissed a girl was 6 years ago. Now the only thing I feel when I see someone attractive is anger, anger for still feeling attracted to them, everytime I catch my self looking at a girl I go mad, I want to go blind, everytime I have to interact with someone beautiful I feel bad, first I get anxious then I get mad at myself.
One year and something ago I download tinder, it was my last try at getting to know someone new, even just friends, but I found out that I have nothing to offer, why would someone go out with me? And found that I can't make new friends, I'm to scared to meet them, I'm too anxious to talk to them, receiving a message just make me feel bad, I don't have anything to offer and if I don't control myself I start to lie and it helps at the time but it turns everything worst at the future, it's like I have to study before every conversation so I don't say something stupid.
It looks so easy for almost everybody and I suffer so much to do it, I just want to turn me off in a way that I'll not hurt my parents, but even this is hard for me.

Still here,"I know I post here quite a bit (in my opinion), but I'm just in the process of building up the courage to try and end it once again. I hope I won't be around to post here much longer.I don't really have any meaningful relationships anymore. Everybody that somewhat cared for me abandoned me. I myself carry an aura that depresses people, which is probably one of the reasons why I get abandoned a lot.I'm in my first year of college and out of the four classes I have, the only one that is really just suicide fuel for me is Biology. I failed the first exam, there's so much homework, and I suck at studying.And on top of that, there's this lingering conflict in my mind, with one side telling myself to keep on living while the other is trying to get me to finally end it. The latter side is gaining ground rather quickly.My family decided to plan our trip to Hawaii (again) right in the middle of my semester, in fact, it's actually right around midterms. I'll be gone the second week of October. I tried to talk them out of going during that time, but they just don't understand that my classes are rather rigorous even though they've been through college as well.

It's quite fitting, actually. One last trip to paradise before I fade away for eternity. Life really isn't worth living, no matter what anybody says. I feel terrible all the time, I hate waking up because after the first few seconds of waking up, the pain returns and I realize that I'm still living, and I also hate laying down to sleep, because I know that morning will eventually come (it's one of the reasons why I stay up so late). I used to be able to at least do my work, but even now that's a mental chore for me. All I'm doing right now is existing and going to school, and tricking my mind into thinking that life is worth living for such and such passions which don't even make me feel any sort of excitement or happiness anymore. I can't socialize. Trust me, I've tried. Many many times. I don't know what it's like to be valued by someone else.As much as I want to live to get rich and find happiness, I have come to realize that the journey to seeking happiness is somewhat a false hope kind of thing, and I figure that even if I reach my goals I still won't be any happier or any less lonelier than I am today.

I'm Feeling Suicidal Again - I Really Need Advice,"For the past month I've been staying with my partner, and I just got back home today. We've been together for over two years now, and we're long distance. We visit each other three times a year or so but it never feels like enough.I've been struggling with chronic suicidality for almost as long as I've known my partner. When we're together I rarely even get depressed, but now I'm back home and I've been home for less than 12 hours and I feel suicidal again already. I spoke with my partner about moving in with him, but he's in the US and I'm in Canada, and the only way for us to legally move in with each other is for us to get married, which is something he says he's not comfortable with and he doesn't think he ever will be. He doesn't want to break up, and wants us to be together, but he says that maybe we might have to just be long distance because he doesn't think he'll ever be okay getting married.

Everything was going so well....,"I didn't hardly have anything to eat last payday.

I am alone. I have a gun. I need a dog.,"My husband is out of town to meet up with some of his fraternity brothers for a football game at their alma mater. No pets. No kids. I am too ashamed of my feelings to call anyone. I am okay 80% of the time, but I suffer from sporadic bouts of depression that include really intense suicidal thoughts/urges. There is a loaded gun in the top drawer of my nightstand for protection. My kitchen is full of knives. My medicine cabinet has an industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen. The liquor cabinet and wine rack hold enough for more than one person. I have only told my husband about these feelings once. I didn't want to. He was driving us to family dinner at my parents' house a little ways away and I started feeling the overwhelming sense of uselessness and wishing I didn't exist while looking at the cement construction barrier to my right. I was taking deep breaths to calm myself, but that isn't an instant fix. The tears started pouring down my face and my husband, not the most observant although super loving and supportive, noticed. He thought he'd done something wrong. He was worried. I told him ""Oh, it's stupid. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with feelings of uselessness and I feel like the world would be way better without me in it. I'll be fine it just takes awhile for these feelings to go away."" He assured me loves me and he would be devastated if anything ever happened to me as would my family, my friends. My coworkers would miss me and for sure one of my bosses would be absolutely lost without me.When I was a teenager I would have really vivid dreams in which I would die in some new horrible fashion every night. I am not exaggerating. It was worse when I would workout. It's no different now at 28. My mind has gotten more creative. It lures me into dreams where my life is perfect. Then, little by little, like picking flaking paint off an old door with your fingernails, it starts to fall apart. If I have a garden, the plants start to die or turn poisonous, slowly infecting the ground and working its thorny vines into my perfect house and tearing apart everything inside with an agonizing slowness I can do nothing to stop. The vines wrap around me and hold me as my husband opens the door I try to scream to warn him, but I'm choking. They stab him through the heart and slowly crush me while he slumps against the door frame, dying. Once he's dead, the vines release me, only to fell me with a similar blow before I can escape. I die knowing that the vines will claim anyone who comes near the house to check on things when I won't answer my phone or my husband hasn't shown up at the office or responded to clients in days. It's my fault. I planted the garden. In high school I had pets, lived with my parents and two sisters, and had lots of friends nearby.My family is only an hour away, but I don't want to let them know what's going on. My husband is out of town and I don't want him to worry. I have one friend in my new city and I don't know her all that well and I don't want her to think I'm crazy. I feel like someone is sitting on my stomach with one hand on my chest and the other forcing my face to look at the nightstand while listing off all my flaws, fears, shortcomings, and failures. I know what they want. I know what's in the top drawer just inches below my hand that's gripping its top. I am waiting for my sanity to come save me. I am typing this hoping that part of myself that wants to live and knows that there is too much to do to die right now shows up soon. The part that still isn't my biggest fan but holds way too much pride to let me fail too bad. The side of me that says ""You really shouldn't do that. It's so weak, selfish, and shameful. Think of your mom, think of your dad. What would they do? Would you really put them through sorting through all your shit to find some clue you didn't leave? Your husband would be so ashamed. How could he feel okay about having people over to comfort him with all this mess. You should get up and clean something. This is ridiculous. Not to mention you're overweight. What would they bury you in? None of your nice things fit anymore. At least lose some weight and clean the house first. We can revisit this then.""I need a dog. Not even a therapy dog. Just a dog. Feeding myself is not reason enough to get out of bed. Taking care of myself is not enough for me to go for a walk. My need and my husband's need to live in a clean and healthy home is not enough to move from our bed. But I do have a friend coming over tomorrow night. She'll definitely think I was crazy if I didn't call or answer the door when she got here. If I had a dog though, I would have gotten up hours ago to feed it and let it out. I am not enough to live for, but I have had a dog before. That dog was my life. I am living to get to a point in my life where it wouldn't be irresponsible or inconsiderate to get a dog. Life is too busy and uncertain right now and it wouldn't be fair to the dog, but I really need one right now. Edit: I need something external to push me from this place because that gun is really close, and I am having trouble talking myself out of this. EDIT2: So, woke up totally fine. Thanks everyone who talked to me last night. Hopefully I won't be back here anytime soon posting about my suicidal thoughts. I plan on coming back to help others going through similar situations.

Reddit causing suicidal thoughts [HELP!],"I want to start this by stating that I've been diagnosed with OCD by psychologists but have always refused to take meds. This
tendency towards compulsive thought and regret seems to stem from the many tumultuous and dark times I have been through in my short and inconsequential life. Two days ago, I indulged in self-harm for the first time. I have a girlfriend and she loves me dearly. I know she would be devastated if I were to end my life but these thoughts seem to obscure any enjoyment for life that I used to have. I don't know how long I'll last.I, for the first time in my life, am considering suicide over a reddit post. There's an old reddit post that contains my personal info and shows up when my name is written into Google. I am an extremely anxious person with a proclivity towards obsessive and compulsive thought. The post in question is immature in nature and there's something about my name showing on the internet on such a post that makes my heart sink, thinking I will never get a decent job and everyone will take me for a fool. And if you're wondering under what form my name appears, it appears in a screenshot.I've tried reaching out to admins, twice and they seem to turn a blind eye to the fact that I'm thinking of ending my life over this. They give me the runaround ""Your full name does not constitute personal information."" which I would say it does. I mean what is there that's more personal than your full legal name? Also, where do you draw the line? A human being is telling you he's suffering and thinking of pulling the plug on his life, yet some old, insignifcant post (except for me, because finding it is a matter of typing my name) that's gathering dust somewhere on the backpages of reddit?I've tried reaching out to the guy who made the post, he agreed to help me and deleted his account shortly thereafter before I was able to provide him with the link that's been plaguing my mind for the past 2 months (I'm assuming he thought deleting his account would translate into all his old posts being deleted). I've tried everything that came to mind, left no stone unturned and have not succeeded in finding a good Samaritan that would help alleviate my pain. My life is in a dark place to begin with and this is starting to feel like the straw that will break the camel's back. Can anyone help me or advise me on what to do?

I'm sick of feeling like my feelings aren't real unless they're experienced in a certain way,"So maybe killing myself will convince me that I really am sufferingEven if I'm not ""really"" suicidalI don't know I just wish I was someone else. And I know no one will give a shit about that. They'll just say ""be yourself"" and leave it at that. Because obviously your persona that annoys people isn't going to cause problems because people will accept you for who you are for some reasonThis life is pointless, after all. I don't do anything. I have no motivation, no confidence, nothing. I don't know why I manage to go on.Maybe it doesn't matter if what I'm experiencing is ""real"" or not. But then I'd have no reason to do this. Or maybe it doesn't matter to have a reason? Jesus I can never keep things consistent in my mind. Maybe this would be a good thing.

I don't have fucking gender dysphoria. I'm deluding myself. Yet I'd bother killing myself over it.Why am I so dramatic? I'm not cringing irl, I just feel...empty? is that the right word?...but if I did feel a bit more I'd be cringing.Meh.I still have some life in me. I could bother saving myself, but I don't feel like it. Now is the perfect opportunity to just...do something...about it...I act like an annoying main character in a book.

I want to show them I'm suffering, that my life sucks, that I'm really this great special person that everyone should love because I have no bad intentions yet I troll my own friends when I feel jealous...the wanting sympathy part, honestly, it's probably another reason for the impostor syndrome shit...because I AM faking it, somewhat...Maybe feeling like I'm faking it is fake too, like I'm doing THAT for attention. I know I'm posting on reddit for attention. I know I'm killing myself for attention. Everything is just a cry for help. I annoy friends (I hardly talk to them about this sort of shit anymore because I feel like I'm such a burden for them) so I go to reddit and I literally post shitty things to strangers and expect sympathy. Obviously I don't always get it. I've used multiple accounts. I've acted far too dramatic. I've basically been a stupid little bitch. Bitch doesn't even feel like a good word for me. I'm practically the opposite of a slut. I purposely make myself look ugly to rebel against the shitty way society views women: they're sex toys with thin revealing clothing with too much makeup and they have to shave in places where men don't have to. Fuck that.I need to end it. I don't want to keep going in circles. I just want to forget about everything and not have to be reminded by my own brain about all the crappy things I've done, the shitty event in my life which might be considered traumatic as I ironically feel a lot worse over it than the day my mom died, but it's all self-inflicted. But no one will fucking get it. And if I dare talk about it, my identity is at risk of being exposed, even though I wasn't that popular..I'm not really suicidal I'm just selfishWho gives a shitI mean I'm depressed, right? But I haven't even seen a therapist so how the fuck do I know if part of that isn't made up tooWait why am I calling part of it real...probably because I know I have something...it's just not legit anymore...I don't know if I'll actually do it. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Like most times where I didn't, I felt too shitty and lazy to do homework, and I'll fail my math test tomorrow, and I don't know...I don't want to see the light anymore and convince myself not to die...isn't that wonderful? Not really. But it sounds incredibly stupid...like, again, I'm making this all up, because I LIKE feeling the pain, otherwise I would've taken steps to improve my mood...like getting enough sleep and eating healthily and shit..I'm not suicidal why am I doing thisFuck everythingI may or may not do this maybe I'll just chicken out because I'm a loser I don't knowI think reincarnation exists though so maybe I'll be able to try againI hope I won't fuck it upMy name is Victoria and I'm a confused selfish dramatic loser.

I don't want to be remembered. I rue that I ever existed (in this way). No matter what the cause of this is, it is so incredibly shameful and confusing. I've wanted to die off and on my entire life, but now I really have seen that this suffering is unnecessary, it leads to nothing good. There is no joy or anything other than intrusive violent thoughts for me in life. I just can't wait to die! Got a gun on the way.
P.S.
huddling together a million freezing cold, mentally ill individuals won't serve to keep me warm. Don't redirect me toward the trans community under the false pretense of self help, comfort, anything.

It got so much better. And now I'm in hell again.,"I don't even know how to begin. About nine months ago I first posted here. I was in hell, like I've been for most of my life. Then at the beginning of the year I decided to risk it all. I told my best friend I always loved him. We got together. I felt like he gave me a purpose and made me felt alive. He showed me the path to get out of hell. I couldn't believe it. In fact, I lost it all. After a couple months, he broke up with me out of the blue, via message, and blocked me. I have been on meds ever since. Part of me wants to destroy him, or what he has become, as he's not who I knew but rather a stranger. Part of me wants to destroy myself. Because I thought it could get better, I could be happy. It's all gone in the blink of an eye. I just have no reason to be here. Life is not fair. I am so tired of fighting, and for what? I gave him everything and all I got as a thank you was to be treated worse than shit. Everything I've done with him was the bright side in my life. I have never been happier.

'your life is perfect'
'you don't need counselling'
'why you even here?'i feel like fucking shit still, and 100% are still suicidal, but im not going to kill myself today. i want to get better for her because it broke my fucking heart hearing her. do i go to the doctors? get kicked out of school like the senior members of staff are trying to do? what do i do? i can't keep living this life of purely survival with no enjoyment.

I thought college would make things better,"I'm away at college and I had nothing back home until a year ago.
I was able to escape from my abusive home life and my trauma related to being molested as a kid through dance. My dance teacher became the father I wish I had and I got other mentors along the way too. I even met bill Clinton at one of my performances which was in front of hundreds of people and also got to perform at Madison square garden. But don't get me wrong, life was still hard. I still wanted to kill myself.
I  started fall in love this summer and now he won't talk to me anymore and I had no closure because I was never given a concrete reason. He was the first boy I've met who has treated me how I deserve to be treated and now he's in a different country and it hurts when I think about him. And IM wearing the necklace he wore right now and it's the only thing that makes me feel safe sometimes.
I also lost control and started harming more this summer but nobody knows that because even though I know it's a good idea to get help, reporting this means being in more college debt and suffering at the hands of my family for longer so I'm trying to power through. If getting help was a rational option, I would go for it.
But then I go to college and it's great here because I don't have to regularly interact with the people who molested me and my horrible disgusting excuses for parents as much but my plans fell through and I was misinformed about the dance opportunities available for me on campus. Long story short, there's a possibility I won't even be able to take ballet, let alone hip hop, which is what I took back home and what helped me through dark times. And I hurt my ankles so I can't even dance in my free time just for fun for likely another week at least.
The only true friends I've ever had in the long term are back home. My mentors back home told me to call them when I got to college, but most of them won't even answer my texts. I get that they're busy. They're talent managers and directors and choreographers and higher ups in the business, but they are also the first people I've ever been able to deem real family and we have a deep bond. They are the reason I am who I am today and want to kill myself much less often than before. Especially my dance teacher. Often whenever we said goodbye to each other we would hug and say I love you but now he doesn't even text me to say he can't talk on the phone. I'm not being clingy. I'm trying not to be a bother but I just need them right now. Is just wanting to say hi from time to time irrational?
I feel like I'm losing everyone all over again. This shit has happened twice before.
I have quality friends back home that have changed my life but I'm not comfortable telling them about how I have been abused and how the boy I love and who love(or maybe loved, depending on the reason why he's done this)  stopped looking me in the eye. So I'm just kind of here in college and honestly I had a tough night. I tried out for dance team and I did horribly and hurt my ankles so that's another door closed with dance and also I did a Tibetan bowl meditation and if any of you guys don't understand meditation, just know that this specific kind often lets you see visions and I had a really depressing vision having to do with the boy I love. It had to do with me re meeting a night recently where I was outside in the cold for 3 hours calling anyone I could think of to talk to them about how much I was hurting but nobody answered until the very end of the night. I called all my mentors and still none of them have texted me saying sorry they missed my call.
And people here at college are nice, so much nicer than the people I regularly interact with back home but they don't know me well enough to understand just exactly how this is all tearing at the seems.i thought college would be a better place for me and it was at first but after tonight, it's safe to say that even though some  things got better it evened out cuz now a lot do other things are getting worse.
I haven't let myself self harm in the last few days but it's really hard not to. I don't really see a reason to keep going anymore, and I'm really good at  finding reasons to keep going. If things are gonna be like this for the next four years, I don't wanna stick around because by the time it does get better I'll be too fucked in the head to appreciate it.
I won't kill myself tonight cuz I never do cuz I'm too scared but I'm afraid that I'm gonna hurt myself and get yet another scar and I get really sad when I look at my self harm scars. They are all from this summer.
I don't really want to be alive right now
Sometimes I feel like the only way my dance teacher would send me a message is if he found out I tried to hurt myself and that's what makes this so tempting. The people I miss would actually talk to me more if they heard about me trying to kill myself. I don't want to make them sad because I love them but I'm so fucking desperate just to get a ""hello how are you I'm sorry I haven't bothered to reply to your messages but I still love you"" I'm willing to go to great lengths. I'm scared of myself right now. I know these are toxic thoughts but honestly I'm so desperate to talk to the people I love that trying to end my life is starting to seem worth it.

I don't know where else to go. I don't know anything anymore other than cops are going to kill me. They tased and beat me in a restaurant about two months ago and I may be losing my mind.,"I'm just the asshole that no one gives a shit about. The Truth of the matter is that they saw me and had already made the decision to fuck with me and I wasn't going to let them. I can and have proven everything in their statements to be false, I can and have proven that everything they say in their reports is a lie and They proved to me that they have not a single fuck to give about ethics because I can't do anything to stop them due to being poor. They'll kill me, they really will and nobody wants to believe that. They came to my house to do a welfare check on the man they tased and beat in a restaurant. He got what he wanted. I've lost the last friend that I had because the right thing to do was to leave her out of it, partly because I love her, Partly because I couldn't trust her knowing she knew more than she told me but, mostly because it was her family that did this to me. I lost any hope of freedom because even on the mistominor charge that they'll stick on me they have that much more time to make up an excuse to confront me. They'll confront me again and put me up against a corner again and the reasonable escalation of force from a taser is a gun. I'll never stop fighting it though because I believe wholeheartedly that it's better to die on the high road and be buried on a mountainside then be found dead in the gutter. I've played a lot of cards in my life and I know when the deck is stacked against me and I know the dealer never loses. I can't see a cop anymore without having an anxiety attack, I don't sleep much and I can barely eat. My own family faults me for all of it. My sister prefers to talk about me then to me. My mother yells at me for not having my shit together and being an asshole all of the time.
I wanted to live a life wherein if I wasn't doing the best I could I was doing the thing that was best I could do for me. I've given up on myself I know most of you think I'm some vile and repugnant piece of shit just smart enough to get myself in trouble.
I don't think it matters anymore what happens to me. I don't think anyone should care about me either. I've fallen in love a handful of times in my life and the reward is only daggers in my back and ghosts haunting me with disapproving looks on their faces.
I very highly doubt anyone will read this, I very highly doubt it matters at this point. Maybe my ranting is just a cry for attention, maybe I'm just putting an epitaph here so one day when I'm gone someone will understand.
I've never been afraid of a fight in my life in any way as long as I knew in my heart that I was on the right side, never paying any mind to which side would in all likelihood win. Most people would call it a fool's gambit but, how would I ever ascribe any meaning to my life... to my death knowing that I wasn't setting out to change the wrong in mine or anyone else's life. I would do anything I could to help anyone who comes to me, regardless of whether they ask because I would never ask for anything from anyone.
Standing in my way has never been a smart place to be and the people behind me aren't safe. I'd say I'd give anything to change that but, in truth, I wouldn't. I wouldn't give up pride or honor for an easier life, I couldn't live with the only two virtues I have to make it a better life for myself knowing that it'll end up hurting someone else, I couldn't live as the animal I'd become not having that system of checks and balances keeping me from my demons.
So here I sit. in pain, defeated and ruined seeing that the ""Good guys"" and the ones after me the most. Feeling like they're watching me now and feeling like I've lost my mind and rationality. Fuck them... fuck me and fuck anyone on either side of my life because I've been fighting monsters long enough to become one and I suppose I'm just toxic now. poison to the ones I love and hate alike.
Don't be me is the best advice I can give. I can only tell you how not to fuck up from a place of hypocrisy and self-contempt. Everything I've said is from the heart and if you've read this far know that I love you. I love you all for being you and not me. I love everyone that has ever been on my side or been in my way thinking that'd I could listen to reason that wasn't from my own heart. I probably don't even know you that well, I probably fucked up your life in some way and I know that love isn't enough to fix a fucking thing.

About ready to die soon,"As of Wednesday last week I made myself homeless and upped and left my job. As a result I moved back up north and am currently living with my grandparents, they are unwell and earlier last night I texted my dad saying that I'm going to declare homelessness and I just had to include in the text that my grandparents wouldn't stop bickering and badmouthing me as if I'm deaf. I can't believe I texted him that now as he went on the offensive and started bombarding my granny with hateful texts. It's currently 5am and the landline has been ringing on and off for the past hour. Nobody is answering but I know it's my dad.

My first problem would that im lonely, i want a girlfriend, someone i can hold by my side when im sad. Someone to talk about video games and anime. I feel lonely while ALL my friends are out kissing and fucking random girls im here beating off and sobbing in my bed. I can make girls laugh and be my best friends but they never want to date. girls say im cute. I hate having dreams about a girl and  we dating to wake up and realize the spot on my bed that she should be is cold. :(. 2. Im starting grade 10 in 2 days.

I'm living 95% of my life for the 5% I'm happy.,"So yeah. 95% of the time I'm contemplating suicide. I've been told all my life that it's the most selfish thing one could do, but is ending your life really selfish if continuing to live would be worse? The top reasons I want to commit suicide are as follows:1) School. This is my first year in a public school (I've been homeschooled all my life). Now that I'm in the NCVA, my grades have plummeted, even though I spend a lot more time doing schoolwork. As a homeschooler, most of my test results were in the college level, as a public schooler, I'm below average. It's absolutely taken over my schedule, and it's the number one reason I want to die.2) My Mom. She certainly knows how to make my free time miserable. She treats nobody kindly, not even my Dad. She has no clue how to raise someone with autism (more on that later). So yeah, quite frankly, she's a b*tch.3) My siblings. I know numbers 2 and 3 are stereotypical, but in my opinion, I have the most selfish, self-centered, bratty siblings ever. At least my youngest brother is cute.4) My schedule. Most of the free time I have I have to lie about. My parents don't even know I have a Reddit account, and they would kill me if they found out (at least then I would be happy).5) My disorders. I have autism, and I'm 80% sure I have bipolar too. Autism I actually like, although it does make my social life awkward, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't lose it if I could. Bipolar on the other hand I would gladly lose. And the worst part is, nobody else knows I have it.Sorry if that was a bit weird. I just like to lay things out mechanically. You could say it's an autism superpower. So 95% of my life is hell. The other 5% of my life is when I'm at church (and I don't even consider myself a Christian). When I'm at church, I help out in children's ministry, get to see my friends (the main reason I haven't committed suicide yet, aside from me being a p*ussy, is them), play video games (yeah, my church is awesome), and just have an all around blast. Unfortunately, 5% of my life isn't enough to keep my going. I'm 12, and nearly jumped off a wall on Wensday. I don't know how long it will be until I follow through with it.P.S Thanks if you read all that.

Should I stay or should I go?,"Today is the day. But I am having second thoughts. I have tools in my backpack to do the deed after work. I want to go though with it, because I hate myself so very much, and I feel like my life in in an irreparable place, and i just want this ball of paranoia in my stomach to go away. I am scared of the damage im going to leave behind. I have no empathy left for family. I could care less how my parents or siblings are going to feel, my girlfriend is not going to be to happy about this. I have twin daughters who are 10 months old, and they are the only people who I actually care for. They do not understand, all they will know is daddy isn't around anymore. No more playtime, no more funny faces, no more snuggles. I want to push through for them, but I cant... I just cant handle these emotions and this constant whirlwind in my mind anymore.

I'm 16... I don't want to live anymore,"I made this account just so I can share my story I need some comforting as I sit here writing this tears roll down my eyes, thoughts running through my head thinking is there really any point living anymore? I am turning 17 next month but I don't want to be here anymore. I have extreme anxiety and depression and I try to hide it away from everyone, I keep everything to myself and shy and embarrassed to tell anyone. Due to my anxiety I pushed everyone away I lost my best friend of 14 years and all my other friends so now I have none, my mum and dad are not really supportive about my anxiety and don't understand, I feel like they don't love or care about me, my little brother treats me like shit and I don't really see my older sister as she lives far away from me. I have no cousins that I can even hang with as they don't live in the same country as me, my mums side of the family live in different countries and my dad side of the family live far away from us. At 14 I had a 2 year relationship when I thought I was really in love and found my future husband ( I know sounds stupid at such a young age but I guess that's why... I was so young to know anything about love)  to who I lost my virginity to, where I was mentally and physically abused and hit and threatened and controlled and cussed for the last months of the relationship, everyone was telling me to leave him all my friends, my sister, my mum, even my school teachers but I didn't listen to them and I chose to find the good in this toxic person because I loved him but one day I finally had the strength and realised I deserved much better and left him because he was also cheating on me which left me heartbroken and which triggered my whole anxiety and depression and has left me as a broken person till this day, he also made out I was the bad person in the relationship and somehow he got everyone to believe him because everyone thinks that I did him wrong when I really didn't and they don't know what happened behind closed doors, but after that relationship I was so hurt so I kept meeting up with lots of boys with my friends and getting drunk and kissing and hugging lots of boys just to feel loved again but I would NEVER EVER  let my broken heart lower my standards to go and have sex with these boys but rumours got spread by my ex and now people call me a ""hoe""  and all his friends (girls) see me on the streets and try to fight me or call me names. My parents have noticed I have changed and became such a angry, short tempered, unsociable person even my ex best friend kept telling me I had changed. I used to smoke I started with cigarettes and it lead to smoking weed all day everyday, I used to stay out until midnight also drinking alcohol, lying all over the roads and floors throwing up but also enjoying myself so much, the reason as to why I turnt to weed and alcohol is because it made me feel better about myself and made me feel more confident and I could be myself while I was high or drunk I felt happy funny, talkative,bubbly and so happy with life. I find it so upsetting how I have to take drugs to make me feel like myself, but I haven't drank or smoked in quite a while due to being inside my house all day which I think is making my illness worse. All I ever do now is sit in my room all day on my phone I only go downstairs to get my food and bring it back into my room to eat. I go to the hospital twice a week due to some problems I have but that's the only time I really step out of my house since I lost my best friend. The tiniest things can make me cry and hurt my feelings and I hate feeling this way I want to be strong and confident. I also feel fat, everyone tells me that I am slim and that I have a big bum, I have a flat stomach and that I have a beautiful face and all the boys go crazy for me  but I just can't stop eating due to feeling upset all the time and being inside bored. My mum and dad don't ever get me anything anymore, they used to spoil me get me whatever I wanted and treat me so special until I changed and now I'm starting to think the way they treat me is my fault because of the way I am towards them, I feel like they only love my older sister and little brother and that I am the odd one out. There was always jokes made about me being found in a bin ( my siblings would say it when I was annoying them) but even though they are joking it makes me think maybe I was adopted due to not feeling loved as much as my siblings by my parents.  I have to start college and everyone has already started whereas I have not even applied for one due to not wanting to go to any where I live because of all the people where I live screaming nasty things to me that my ex rumoured about me to everyone that even my ex best friends are joining in with it. I really wanna move house out of this place where I live but my parents don't want to move yet but the more and more I think about it there just gonna be everywhere so I had asked my mum if we can move country to where her family are but she said it would take at least 2 years and I can't wait that long. I also deleted  all my social media due to being scared what everyone thinks of me or getting rude messages from anyone, I really want to do my course or apprenticeship and make some money for myself but I am too scared to go out and do it and meet new people!! What am I going to do :( my mum and dad don't understand they keep telling me off for it and saying I have no ambitions when I really do, today a education lady from the council came to my house to speak to me about college and further education and my mum told her about my anxiety, she is also someone that helps with anxiety and depression so I am going to have sessions with her and hopefully she can help me get better but I feel like this anxiety will never go away I've had it for years now... I've just had enough, I also used to cut my wrists but I stopped a year ago, something happened this year which made me do it again but that was the only time. I am even afraid to post this incase anyone hates on me but there's nothing I can do, I pray to god every night to make my life better and protect me I guess it's all up to him now because I really feel like leaving this life forever and I'm sure no one will care ...",A3,0.95,"The text indicates severe emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation ('is there really any point living anymore?').

Why do I feel this way,"I have a big meme account on Instagram. I'm a really successful athlete. I'm popular. No one knows that I want to just fucking die. I just want to die more than anything. I'm 17 and live on my own in the basement of some bodies house. I pay rent. I'm successful by social standards. But what made me realize I wanted to die was while I was writing something to a girl I've been talking to for a while. I'm just gonna copy and paste it. Keep in mind we are best friends in snapchat so I talk to her the most out of anyone and she's the same with me. Also we hang out for hours. Also she is really really hot. And not basic. Here it isFirst of all I'm glad I met you and we are not gonna stop talking cause there is no one else I'd rather talk to. Second of all I'm sorry for making you cry. That was really weird for me cause I haven't been that close to crying in a really long time.  Third I think you're confused and conflicted and a lot of that is my fault which makes me feel even worse. I say this cause one second you're telling me how you want to break up with your boyfriend and staying up with me till 3 in the morning talking about complete bullshit just so we don't have to hang up. Then the next you tell me how you just want to friendzone me and that you want a hug from your boyfriend and you need to talk to me less. And it hurts me.  Cause it pulls me in closer to you. And then you push me away. And obviously you could just stop talking to me and me to you. But I don't want that. I really don't. I actually have fun being around you no matter what it is we are doing. And I know you feel the same.
I hate being something that causes stress in your life Mary. I just want to make you happy. But it's hard to try and maintain a balance of supporting you in what's best for you, when what's best for you is awkward for us to talk about. You have a boyfriend yeah. A boyfriend in a different state who you may see once or twice a year who you don't love anymore but you have fond memories of.  And it's really hard cause you're for real my dream girl which sounds really gay and edgy and I cringe at my awkwardness as I type this but it's true. I haven't ever said some gay shit like that before. And I know you have flaws and insecurities but that's what I like about you. You're really complex and it's really amazing. And I really like everything about you. And I know it may be hard to read this but that's life Mary. Life is fucking hard. Some days I'm miserable and regret everything I've ever done. I wake up in a cold basement every morning and walk to my cold kitchen and drink a glass of water from the sink. Then I take a shower and get dressed in the clothes I bought with my own money and walk the silent 30 minutes to school. I normally don't say my first word in the morning till at least an hour after I woke up. Cause I have no one to say it too. I feel so lonely sometimes. And it's weird cause I wake up to 60 messages of people calling me a god and trying to pay me to make them bigger. So why do I feel so lonely and awful. Why do I feel like no one actually cares. Except you. The person who says she doesn't care. The person who acts like me and her don't matter at all and that she doesn't even care. Why do I feel like she's one of the few people who care so much. There's no way I'm wrong. I don't even know if I'm going to send this cause I'm a pussy no matter how tough I might act. And if I did send it it's only cause I'm scared that if i don't, I'll lose you.
At this point i realized I'm miserable. Now I'm thinking about getting really drunk. Going to her house and telling her this and depending on what happens killing myself after. I guess we shall see how this goes",A0,0.0,Failed after 3 attempts,True,low_confidence,,

"Completely fucked up, don't give a flying fuck anymore","I'm crazy, I think. I went to the psych ward last night after a breakdown at a garden party. My friends were all with me and made sure I got there safe. Once I was there I waited for hours. I told them I wanted to kill myself and they told me that a suicide center would contact me in about two weeks latest. I dont know what to do. I won't kill myself now but that's only 'cause I feel like I am too weak. I tried once before and didn't succeed. I have much to live for, but I don't have the will. These thoughts are all scrambled because I am drunk and high right now. I don't like this world. It's not for me. Society is fucked up in general. The world is cruel and so am I. I don't want to hurt people around me, but I do. I hate myself. I am weak. I'm still alive because nothing matters in the end, which means that it makes no difference, long term, if I live or not. I am here because I'm scared. I hate myself. I'm really desperate and I'm sick of hurting everyone around me. My suicidal thoughts are always present, but I usually would not act on it because nothing matters in the end. But when I feel worse than already emotionally, suicide comes that much closer. I don't know what to do anymore because I've been through the system so many times and nothing had helped, and this time they just want me to wait until suicide prevention helps me. I want to fix the reason why I'm suicidal because that's what fucks me up. But I don't know the reason. Doctors are filled with conformation bias, and seem to always look for what they think is most interesting (I would know because my parents are both doctors). And therefore I have never gotten a neutral treatment. I don't even know if I truely think I'm the fucked up one. I think it's the world. The world we live in is sick. It's sickening. None of it really matters, but everyone accepts it. The world is cruel, fucked up and inhumane. Maybe I'm sick, maybe it's the world, but I just don't know what to do.

my crippling fear of the dark is a burden,"having a fear of the dark is ""childish"" because ""only children are scared of the dark"". but i am sick and tired. ive always had a fear of the dark, as a child it was VERY bad but as i got older it settled down a bit but i couldnt be in a dark room without freaking out, but i could sleep in one. but not so recently the fear has come back and its worse. as a child i would keep the door open but now i sleep with all my lights on. i always feel like im being watched; being followed. ive never been stalked in my life, so its not related to a traumatic past. i always look behind me or see things in the light or dark that i think is going to kill me. it is unberable. i cannot live like this, i cannot live cooped up in my house with all the lights on 24/7. i also live with my parents because i simply cannot be left alone otherwise id have a major panic attack. but my parents call me childish,stupid and say ""dont be an idiot"". it hurts. i cannot live normally like this and they wont even help me. its driving me insane. i just want to die to end it all. just imagine having something always in the corner of your eye, taunting you. if i dont kill myself whatever is following me is. i dont believe in ghosts but i no longer sleep, i just stay up with my lights on. i cant do it anymore, i just cant. no one takes me seriously. when i told my friend she just laughed at me, realised i was being serious but still wasnt 100% genuine. all i think is ending mine or someone elses life. i need helo but id rather just die. i dont think what im going to do tomorrow, i just think if id finally have the balls to kill myself.",A3,0.95,"The text indicates severe distress, feelings of being watched or followed, inability to live normally, and mentions self-harm or harm from perceived entities.

As much as I 100% want to die, kill myself and forever spend eternity with you. I can't. I can't knowingly put my family, my friends, the people that would be effected by my suicide. I can't knowingly put them through the tsunamis of pain, the mental earthquakes that has shaken me to the core, that has destroyed the pillars of support that held me together.The ones that your decision sent my way. The ones that cause me to be completely and utterly terrified of waking up in the morning because I know I have to spend another day knowing she isn't here on this earth.

The decision that has led my life to spiral since your death, the one that have led me to coming to the brink of taking my own life as well in hopes of joining you. In hopes of being with you again. I will forever spend my life wishing i had taken my life during the times i could have. Wishing that i had made that step when i had the choice. No matter how wrong i thought your choice was. No matter how much I know I could have given you the help you needed. No matter how much i resent your decision for not only not telling me about this decision but also for following through with it. Yet I could never resent you. I could never resent the loving, caring, loyal and beautiful soul that was wrongfully blanketed in darkness. The one that hated herself and felt that she was only living for the sake of others. The one that couldn't see the beauty and perfection of which I saw. The kindness and goodness of your heart that your clouded eyes could not see. I can only say I am truly happy that you are not living this life you hate, the life which others corrupted and destroyed, the life you never deserved but was forcefully given it. The one that caused you astronomical amounts of pain and misery to the point where you could not see an escape. I am glad you don't have to suffer anymore. Because I love you, because i love you more than words could even express. So i have decided i will harbour your pain. I will spend hours trying to fall asleep but eventually waking up in the early hours of the day crushed by your absence. I will spend every waking moment in sadness in despair, grieving over your loss. I will spend every time I wake up fucking exhausted and cowering in fear that I am not living a nightmare but a reality without you in it. I will spend my life in hopes forever in love with you. Forever wishing you told me. Forever wishing I had been able to save you. Forever forcing myself to march on no matter how much i want to join you. I will wake up everyday in hopes that I will die today. In hopes that I will finally join you. I am not saying that your decision is selfish. Because it's not. You were in so much pain and misery that you couldn't stand it anymore. However knowing the effects that a decision like yours can cause, I cannot do it.

His family sent his to a RTC for 2 years and he has this resentment towards his parents because they sent him away because he pissed dirty but not when he tried killing himself (so he knows it wasn't out of them caring about him). I told him so many times that I care about him and love him a lot still but he just doesn't feel it and believe it.In my communications class we learned about this thing called a ""love language"" and long story short he really only feels love through service (actions) and I really only feel love through affirming words. So for a long time we were just not sending love that is catered to each other because he would always show me but never really tell me and I would always tell him but never really show him.

A letter to myself.,"Dear Self.You like to think that your problems began on Christmas Eve, of the year 1993 when you were raped, beaten and strangled. You were a seven year old boy then. The truth of the matter is is that the problems began shortly after conception. That genetic mishap that was placed inside your genetic sequencing, that ticking time bomb that inevitably went off at the age of fourteen, when you tried to commit suicide for the first time. You stole your father's pistol from his closet, loaded it, and pressed it to your temple. It failed to fire because your father was a failure at maintaining his guns properly. Strangely, upon remembering this, I seem to find it a fitting metaphor for how you have turned out. While your father was a failure at maintaining his guns, you have become the same failure at maintaining personal relationships, your work duties, your own fatherly responsibilities. All of which have led to other suicide attempts, which predictably, have ended in failure. These are only a few of the many fuckups you have endured in your thirty-one years in life. You have subsequently shown that you are incapable of interacting with people like a normal human being. Remember that night where you became everything you ever hated, and attempted to rape that guy? Another failed suicide attempt followed that little endeavour. You vowed to give up sex after that altogether, swearing to become a better person. You failed at that as well. Instead, you married the person you slept with next. Sired two children. They may love you dearly, but she hates you. You know she does. The way she glares at you when she thinks you're not looking. The fact she now refuses to sleep in the same bedroom as you, and becomes physically sick if you touch her, The fact you're on the road many weeks at a time providing a pathetic excuse for a living for her and your two kids. For fuck sakes, the power has been turned off more times than you can count because you can't make enough money to keep it on. You've failed as a provider. You have failed as a husband. You failed at Marriage.Worst of all, you've failed at being a good father.You've missed so much. Your son's first words and steps. Your daughter's first days of First, second, and third grade. You're worse than your father ever was, and HE had the audacity to call you a liar when you cried to him after being raped. You're fucking worthless. Look at you. Self medicating in alcohol and weed, masturbating twice a day constantly chasing that temporary high that will ultimately take the crushing weight of having fucked up every good thing that could have possibly come your way.To your credit, you'd never change your children. They're the only thing that gives you hope. But maybe... just maybe... they'd be happier if you weren't around. One less white trash, confused bisexual dad in the world to screw them up forever and ever couldn't hurt that much, could it? I mean, look at yourself. You're deeply unhappy. You're mentally scarred, terrified of everything, barely able to take care of yourself. Ultimately, you will die alone, some nurses' or doctor's burden that they'd be annoyed to be obligated to try and help. You're growing older, fatter, sadder, and yet still hold steadfast to the desperate need to try and hide from all of this.That's why I needed to write this letter. This post for everyone to see. You've been considering ending it again. Possibly taking someone with you. Despite the treatments for your steadily declining mental health, you find yourself back in the depths of the darkness and it's far worse than it ever has been before. Violent urges, thoughts of self harm and suicide, all of these things are piling up on you like an avalanche and you feel as though there is no one to talk to. No one cares to listen anymore because you're such a fucking crybaby about your mental problems. It's cost you so many friends and even family members. Your wife won't even bother to listen to you anymore. You are truly alone in the darkness and it is consuming you this time, your inner demons finally winning out despite a decade of fighting like hell against them. You could tell your doctor about it, but he's already certain the medication that you're on is THE THING that will make you normal again.As if you were ever normal. I really don't know how to end this letter. I guess things like this don't ever end. I'll always be that voice in your head, criticizing you, telling you what you already know about yourself but refuse to acknowledge, baring the truth in all it's naked glory for you to try and shy away from. I will be with you until the end. Which needs to come sooner, rather than later.

The people I live and work with are great, but not anyone I'd go to with this. My psychiatrist is also several states away back home.
I just got this job; I volunteered for the company full time last year and was offered a salaried position and have been working it 2 weeks and can't screw this up. I'm too far in debt to rack up hospital bills, and I couldn't even take the time off to go inpatient; I get 5 vacation days a year and I want to use those to go home for Christmas.
I know what'll end up happening is I'll attempt again, and hopefully succeed. The way I see it, there's no other choice. I'm alone either way.

"I'm 18 [M]. alone and ugly, I've had suicidal thoughts for the last 4 years.","My teeth are crooked, I have glasses, my face is somewhat disproportionate and all my friends make jokes about my appearance all the time. I haven't had a girlfriend since 2013 and even she was embarrassed to be with me, so much so that she broke up with me by telling one of my friends to inform me of the fact because she didn't want to be seen with me.At this point I don't know what to do, since that time I've had suicidal thoughts but never as much as now, I'm the only one of my friends that is a virgin and it seems like every girl I meet instantly judges me based on my appearance, which I don't even blame them for because I am pretty ugly if I do say so myself.
I love being myself but it seems like nobody else likes it when I am. I'm a musician but all my friends hate my music and my voice which doesn't exactly help my self esteem too much, I'm also unemployed and in every job interview I've gone to the interviewer acts like they aren't going to hire me because I don't look good. I can't even get into the college course I want to take because my math grades are too low because of my stupid dyscalculia math disorder.

"I don't know who or what I am, I'm drowning in work and classes, and I just can't take it anymore. [Long]","I hate every last part of who I am, from my gender to my hair color and everything else. I hate the bloody, disgusting hole between my legs and wish I could fill it with cement. PIV is not pleasurable for me and stresses me out. Menstruation, pregnancy, and birth all sound horrible. Maybe I'd want a kid of my own one day, but I have no desire to carry that baby, and my male SO can't do it...I hate the balls of fat on my chest and wish I could cut them off and just have a flat chest like a guy. I have red hair that everyone is constantly commenting on. I don't like the attention. I've cut it very, very short (like a 5 with clippers) and wear a hat partially to hide it and keep it from drawing attention. I hate the apartment my SO and I are living in. He's asked me to vocalize what I hate about it specifically, but I'm honestly not even sure exactly what it is. But I honestly do. For the first few weeks, I couldn't stand being there at all, and hid under the bed to not have to see it while I cried about it. Eventually, I just kind of accepted it. I still hate it, but I don't constantly cry about that in particular.I'm currently attending a school I hate, doing a double major in 2 subjects I don't necessarily love. One's difficult and I took it on because my SO and a friend thought I'd be good at it. The other's a bullshit major; something to fall back on in case I fail out of the hard one. I used to be a perfect student, but last semester I failed a class for the first time and had to repeat it over the summer.I don't want to sound like I'm blaming anyone or like I'm playing the victim, but I'm going to end up sounding that way. A lot of my problems stem from an abusive mother (physically, verbally, emotionally) and my abusive ex (rapist). I haven't spoken to my mother in over a year, and sometimes I wish I had a real mother. I was with my ex for 2 years and raped hundreds of times during that span. He pinned me down and had me call him ""master"". I've been self-harmer since. But recently, I've gotten a lot more reckless with it. I used to cut on just one thigh, then moved to just one hip when I couldn't hide my thigh very well in the summer. Now, I'm cutting from my thighs to the top of my breasts, and everything in between, as well as my wrists.I've given up completely on making friends. I lost all my friends in high school thanks to the mess I became with my ex. I don't talk to people in class, and I don't go any more in depth than necessary with customers and random people who try to engage me. All my emotions seem muted. Anxiety has taken a backseat, and now I just try to force myself to go to class and do the bare minimum to keep up appearances that I'm a normal, functioning human being. I don't really feel anything at all, let alone love, for my family, and even my feelings for my SO seem muted or hard to access (I'm not totally sure how to explain it...).But I'm still a mess. And there's nothing i can do about it. I want to die. I can't handle 18 credits, 2 jobs, and relationships. I can't quit my first job because it's part of my financial aid (work study). I don't want to quit my second job because it's the only thing I enjoy even a little out of the main three (2 jobs and school). I can't drop out of school because I'd lose financial aid and screw up any future I still have a chance at. I don't even see a future right now. I cannot imagine myself alive next week, let alone in 5 years. I don't have the time or energy or desire for therapy. I don't need to waste hours of my week spilling my guts (something else I cannot do) and hearing someone tell me, ""Think positive! It gets better! Mindfulness!"". I can't tell anyone or talk to anyone other than my SO. The only other choice I can see for myself going forward is suicide.

The realization that you're gonna have to die,"Pretty much how I feel right now. This is my first time writing here. I feel like I could have at many points before, but now it feels like I have truly reached the end and there is nowhere else to go.It has been a long fucking year. 2017 in general has been but I've attempted suicide twice in the last 12 months. Last October was a very serious attempt, and then in April was a half assed attempt where I took a bunch of pills and then threw them up shortly after.I'm 27 now and while I have been dealing with depression and extreme highs/lows all my life, it has always been very fleeting. I'd have a few days of crying and then it'd go away. Well it wouldn't go away, but it'd be in the back of my mind and I'd move on and stuff. I was also never considering suicide at those points no matter how hopeless I was. It was something I thought about for sure, but at the time I never gave it serious thought.In February I had some things happen to me that triggered a full blown depression. For 2.5 months, til mid-April, I was crying almost every day, stopped talking to many people, and didn't do much of anything. It was bad. For most of it I was only considering suicide half the time, and after my attempt in April I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't go through with another serious attempt until I tried everything possible to improve my life.Well here I am. I'm literally failing at what is my last resort in life. I've always had another path to take but I am seriously out of options now. This was the end of the line. The only thing going right for me is that I am living in my ideal city. Everything else I am failing at.27 years old now and every attempt I have made to change things has failed miserably.

How to get out of this always recurring black thoughts,"Hi everyone. I am really kind of desperate so i am writing here something. As i'm not native english speaker, sry about all grammar mistakes and hopefully you will still understand what i mean. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Has to do with some family issues. I can't remember a time without depressive phases. When is was 17 years old, it was the first time i really wanted to die. I mean, i thought about suicide the years before. But that time, i really wanted to. I can remember, that some weeks before i started to feel nothing. Not even when i cut myself and these had been the worst cuttings ever since i started with it whe n i was 12. At one point I felt so tired. Tired of all the pain. Tired of all the selfhatred. Tired of feeling anything. So I prepared to shoot myself. But somehow, as i had the gun already put in my mouth, there was something screaming in me, like: ""don't do it!"". I think that was the so called self preservation. So i searched a therapiest, got some medicaments and life went on. More or less it was okay. I could handle the recurring depression. But 2 years ago, with almost 24 it started again. The depression phase just didn't end. After a half year, i took a break for 2 months in a daytime psychiatric. I came back to work and three weeks later i tried to commit suicide again and woke up in the hospital. Three days later i was back to work. In the beginning of 2017 there happened some things at work..at privat life. I just couldn't regain back some power... friends can't take my dark thought and depression anymore. Instead of losing them, i pretend since a half a year that everything is fine. One guy, my co worker, grew then very close to me. We had an affair. He told me he will be there. I told him everything. I didnt do that for a long time..maybe never. I felt so secure with him. But it was complicated as well. Because he was already in a long term relationship (yeah, maybe everything that happened by now is bad karma because i deserve). So few weeks ago his girlfriend started to feel suspicious. He stopped the affair. That was really hard but he still told me he has feelings and that he wanted to me be part im his life as a true friend. This was enough. It was okay. Today he wrote me that not even a friendship is possible anymore. He doesnt feel anything for me. As co workers we have to go on and he wants to have a good time at work with me. But there cant be a true friendship. It devasted me. I stayed home. I know, i may deserve it. I did mistakes. But i feel so alone, devasted, empty and a huge selfhatred. He was the only one who really knew about me and who i thought could handle me. But he can't either. No one can. I feel like a big failure.. no one can stay with me. I have no power to fight everything anymore...i turn soon 26 and i fought my whole life but what if this is going on and on? what if i'm a failure? I really am miserable...Does someone suffer this long too and can tell me that at one point everything went well? What should i do?

In fact, it is becoming more of my MO than anything: ""Find a place, things are fine for a few months, something goes wrong, I end up moving out/almost homeless."" I am so tired of this. Because of this cycle of instability, I am starting to develop signs of BPD which I never had before...or maybe I did but was undiagnosed and my life is just exacerbating the disorder to ungodly levels. Either way, this is hell and I don't want to do this anymore. Currently, I am staying with friends who were nice enough to put up with me for the last 7 months, but since I can't find work in this town due to being noticeably transgender (small christian right wing area in SoCal), and my depression issues are starting to affect the household, I have to move out. I have nowhere to go.Since my birthday is next month, I think I am going to go to Vegas, since I have never been there, and have one last hurrah. I am thinking I may even try hard drugs for the first and potentially last time in a seedy hotel room because I think that would be the most painless way to go...and I just cant do this anymore. I'm adult enough to see and admit when I have been bested...so here's me knocking down my king and calling the game -- what other option do I have? Keep trying? For what? The definition of insanity is trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. So again, I ask, for what purpose? To get even more rejection, more of being a coward that is afraid to live because I am a 6'2"" non-passing trans woman that people don't take seriously, more of asking the women in my life for help in the department of appearing more feminine and they all have better shit to do -- but will drop their life and jump at the chance to help a more passing and cute trans girl become all cute and pretty, more being othered and misgendered by people who in the same breath will tell me they love me and want the best for me, more moving from town to town trying to find my way only to get lost and fall down again, more trying to gauge social interactions and fumbling over my words and then no one wants to talk to me because I'm a weird freak, or constantly thinking I am a burden on everyone around me? Nah, I have had enough heartbreak and BS to last me a few lifetimes, and I am pretty certain I will not be missed. Sure, upon news of my passing people will likely go through the motions to seem socially acceptable to their peers -- and some may even cry, but they will get along fine, and in 6-8 weeks i will be a memory, and a year from now I may even become an anecdote to pepper conversations with, though I am doubtful of this. My own mother, brothers, stepdad, and anyone else that I once held dear before my transition won't even acknowledge my existence because I transitioned, and I now have no one. I try to make new friends but it is hard and this BPD makes the experience a complete nightmare, despite my best intentions. I just wish I knew what the fuck happened to me, fuck! I never wanted to be this person.Why am I like this...I don't remember saying ""I want to be a depressive wreck when I grow up,"" during career day in grade school. Fuck, why me?!I constantly feel like I am not good enough and like I am completely unloved. Worst of all, I feel like it is all my fault and I deserve all of this, I did it to myself - because I am weird and crazy. And I never wanted any of it...but that has been my life. Every time I try to insert some form of order and normalcy in my life, chaos rears its ugly head and throws everything on the floor. Each time I try to settle down and fight to find and maintain a job, start paying my bills on time and regularly, saving money, allowing myself to make plans for the future, and try to become a responsible person, the floor drops out and I am lampooned once again. This constant succession of falling down only leads me to start pondering things like, ""why even try?"", which, in the past I had answers for...but now,  not so much. The only person I have left to live for is myself and I am not selfish or a narcissist nor am I really worth much of an effort, so I am thinking that since no one cares about me -- including me, I will just fade away to nothingness and either die of an OD or get hooked on hard drugs -- either way it is a win for everyone else because they won't be bothered by me anymore. Maybe people will find out, maybe they won't, either way, I am just so tired of trying to save myself, and tired of asking for help in saving myself just to get ignored, passed over, or getting a good thing which I then end up completely fucking up. I know I have only been on reddit for a short while, but I have enjoyed it here and the people are nice. So, until we meet again when we are both cats...Thank you for listening, fellow redditors.

17 and at the end of my rope,Hi my name is Austin I�۪m 17 and for many years I�۪ve hated my life. I�۪ve had this crazy plan since i was like 8 and by the time I hit 10 I was practicing it and going through with it. My plan was that I would write a single page every day in a journal on my computer. Nothing much just a paragraph or two a day until I was 18. Then I would Decide if life was worth living. these pages are summary�۪s of my day to day activities and In the top right Corner there would be to check marks to check one good and one bad. Well I�۪ve been doing this daily ritual since I was 10 transferring up the hard drive in my computer over and over as I upgraded and meticulously backing it up over and over. Recently over the last 10-11 months my life has token a rough turn I guess I�۪ve discovered that many of my friends have been very good at hiding how fake they are and then using my caring heart about other against me. And many other little aspects in my life have spiraled out of control. I slowly more and more find my self thinking about suicided. I find Comfort in the Notion of it strangely. Some times the thought of it really allows me to breath and feel like I�۪m in control. (Side note: I am a control freak that overthinks many things.) I�۪ve been in depression for many year and I have thought about killing my self and just ending it many times. I�۪ve even had multiple occasions where I was stuck  in my small prison cell size room with a gun to my head and just never could do it because I�۪m bound to a date. I can�۪t kill my self until my 18 birthday that�۪s when I�۪ll sit down in my room and read every single page in this journal that I have ever wrote and I will assess the ratings on all of them and mark the tally�۪s down. At that point I will decide if I want to live or not. My only fear is about this is I�۪ve had depression in my life for so long that I think if I survive this ultimatum that I assigned my self I will never ever escape depression. It�۪s always going to be there in the back of my head just Running around and around. I feel Like I�۪m never going to escape,A0,0.0,JSON parse error,True,low_confidence,,
I feel broken I feel worthless.,"Consistent ridicule from the people I care about has always had a negative effect on me, especially recently while I've been struggling to find some will to live. I don't have my license and I'm almost 19 I feel so behind the pack so useless. My mother doesn't want me to come live with her or see me because I'm too much of a headache and a burden. I'm terrible with women and just want to feel loved; I'm so tired of being alone I'm so tired.

Third attempt in a year.,"Hi SW, I'm 21 from TX/USA, 3 days ago I tried to overdose on sleeping meds and alcohol.I was heavily intoxicated when I made my attempt and had been in an argument with a friend which was a recipe for disaster.I knew the combination I took would not kill me but I intended to die from the overdose, so the intention was there but not quite the means to be successful.I don't think I have any significant adverse effects from the overdose aside from feeling tired.I cannot seek medical attention because I may lose access to my prescription for ADHD which enables me to function, I am currently out of my ADHD med which may be another negative effect on my mood.I have been on an SSRI for around 3 months and it has improved my mood.However, I've read that my anti-depressant paroxetine causes a slightly increased chance of suicidal behavior in patients under 24 which may have played a role in my attempt. I have had an increase in suicidal thoughts since starting paroxetine.I will likely talk to my doctor about the increase in suicidal thoughts and switch to another SSRI.I don't know why I wrote this, I'm not able to see therapist so I guess that's why I posted this, just to be able to vent some emotions and thoughts.",A3,0.95,"The individual has recently attempted suicide with intent, reports ongoing suicidal thoughts, and is unable to access therapy or medical attention due to concerns about losing ADHD medication.

Nothing matters.,"I used to love everything I did. I got nothing but As in school and put my best effort into everything. Even though my parents were divorced and I didn't have that many friends, I was doing just fine.Now that I'm in the 8th grade, everything has changed. I don't have the purpose to do well in school, but every failed test and quiz is like a knife to the heart. My father will disown me if he sees my grades or if I associate myself with African-American people, even though I think he's insane for saying so.

Because they're beautiful and smart, unlike me.
